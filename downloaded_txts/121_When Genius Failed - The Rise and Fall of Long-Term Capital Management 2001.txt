Introduction
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is perched in a gray sand-
stone slab in the heart of Wall Street. Though a city landmark build-
ing constructed in \17972.4, the bank isa muted, almost unseen presence
among its lively, entrepreneurial neighbors. The area is dotted with
discount stores and luncheonettes--and, almosteverywhere,broker-
age firms and banks. The Fed's immediate neighbors include a shoe
repair stand and a teriyaki house, and also Chase Manhattan Bank;
J.E Morgan is a few blocks away. A bit farther to the west, Merrill
l\177ynch, the people's brokerage, gazes at the Hudson River, across
which lie the rest of America and most ofMerrill'scustomers T. he
bank skyscrapers project an open, accommodative air, but the Fed
building, a Florentine Renaissance showpiece,is distinctly forbid-
ding. Its arched windows are encased in metal grille, and its main en-
trance, on Liberty Street, is guarded by a row of black cast-iron
sentries.
The New York Fed is only a spoke, though the most important
spoke, in the U.S. FederalReserve System, America's central bank.
Because of the New York Fed's proximity to Wall Street, it acts as the
eyes and ears into markets for the bank's governing board, in Wash-

ington, which is run by the oracular Alan Greenspan. William J.
McDonough, the beefy president of the New York Fed, talks to
bankersand traders often. McDonough wants to be kept abreast of
the gossip that traders share with one another. He especially wants to
hear about anything that might upset markets or, in the extreme, the
financial system. But McDonough tries to stay in the background.
The Fed has always beena controversial regulator--a servant of the
people that is elbow to elbow with Wall Street, a cloistered agency
amid the democratic chaos of markets. F'orMcDonough to intervene,
even in a small way, would take a crisis, perhaps a war. And in the
first days of the autumn of t998, McDonough did intervene--and
not in a small way.
The sourceof the trouble seemed so small, so laughably remote, as
to be insignificant. But isn't it always that way? A load of tea is
dumped into a harbor, an archduke isshot,and suddenly a tinderbox
is lit, a crisiserupts, and the world is different. In this case, the shot
was Long-Term Capital Management, a private investment partner-
ship with its headquarters in Greenwich, Connecticut, a posh suburb
some forty miles from Wall Street. LTCM managed money for only
one hundred investors; it e\177nployed not quite two hundred people,
and surely not one American in a hundred had ever heard of it. In-
deed, five years earlier, LTCM had not evenexisted.
But on the Wednesday afternoon of Septemberz3, 1998, Long-
Term did not seem small.On account of a crisis at LTCM, McDon-
()ugh had summoned--\"invited,\" in the Fed'srestrainedidiom--the
heads of every major Wall Street bank. For the first time, the chiefs
of BankersTrust, BearStearns,Chase Manhattan, Goldman Sachs,
J. E Morgan, LehmanBrothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, and Salomon Smith Barney gathered under the oil portraits in
the Fed'stenth-floor boardroom--not to bail out a Latin American
nation but to consider a rescueofone of their own. The chairman of
the New York Stock Exchange joined them, as did representatives
from major Europeanbanks. Unaccustomed to hosting such a large
gathering, the Fed did not have enough leather-backed chairs to go
around, so the chief executives had to squeeze into folding metal
seats.
Although McDonough wasa public official, the meeting was se-
cret. As far as the public knew, America was in the salad daysof one
of history's great bull markets, although recently, as in many previous

autumns, it had seensomebacksliding.Since mid-August, when Rus-
sia had defaulted on its ruble debt, the global bond markets in par-
ticular had been highly unsettled. But that wasn't why McDonough
had called the bankers.
Long-Term, a bond-trading firm, was on the brink of failing. The
fund was run by John W.Meriwether, formerly a well-known trader
at Salomon Brothers. Meriwether, a congenial though cautious mid-
westerner, had been popular among the bankers. It was because of
him, mainly, that the bankers had agreedto give financing to Long-
Term--and had agreed on highly generous terms. But Meriwether
was only the public face of Long-Term.The heart of the fund was a
group of brainy, Ph.D.-certified arbitrageurs. Many of them had been
professors T. wo had won the Nobel Prize. All of them were very
smart. And they knew they were very smart.
For four years, Long-Termhad been the envy of Wall Street. The
fund had racked up returns ofmore than 40 percent a year, with no
losing stretches, no volatility, seemingly no risk at all. Its intellectual
supermen had apparently been able to reduce an uncertain world to
rigorous, cold-blooded odds--on form, they were the very best that
modern finance had to offer.
This one obscure arbitrage fund had amassed an amazing $ioo
billion in assets, virtually all of it borrowed--borrowed, that is, from
the bankers at McDonough's table. As monstrous as this indebted-
nesswas, it was by no means the worst of Long-Term's problems.
The fund had entered into thousands of derivative contracts, which
had endlessly intertwined it with every bank on Wall Street. These
contracts, essentially side bets on market prices, covered an astro-
nomical sum--more than $2 trillion worth of exposure.
If Long-Term defaulted, all of the banks in the room would be left
holding one side of a contract for which the other side no longer ex-
isted. In other words, they would be exposed to tremendous--and
untenable--risks. Undoubtedly, there would be a frenzy as every
bank rushed to escape its now one-sided obligations and tried to sell
its collateral from Long-Term.
Panics are asoldas markets, but derivatives were relatively new.
Regulators had worried about the potential risks of these inventive
new securities, which linked the country's financial institutions in a
complex chain of reciprocal obligations. Officials had wondered
what would happen if one big link in the chain should fail. McDon-

ough feared that the markets would stop working; that trading would
cease; that the system itself would comecrashingdown.
James Cayne, the cigar-chomping chief executiveof Bear Stearns,
had been vowing that he would stop clearing Long-Term'strades--
which would put it out of business--if the fund's available cash fell
below $5oo million. At the start of the year, that would have seemed
remote, for Long-Term'scapital had been $4-7 billion. But during the
past five weeks, or sinceRussia's default, Long-Term had suffered
numbing losses--day after day after day. Its capital was down to the
minimum. Cayne didn't think it would survive another day.
The fund had already asked Warren Buffett for money. It had gone
to GeorgeSoros. It had gone to Merrill Lynch. One by one, it had
askedevery bank it could think of. Now it had no place left to go.
Thatwas why, like a godfather summoning rival and potentially war-
ring families, McDonough had invited the bankers. If each one
moved to unload bonds individually, the result could be a worldwide
panic. If they acted in concert, perhaps a catastrophe could be
avoided. Although McDonough didn't sayso, he wanted the banks
to invest $4 billion and rescue the fund. He wanted them to do it
right then--tomorrow would be too late.
But the bankers felt that Long-Termhadalreadycaused them more
than enough trouble. Long-Term's secretive,close-knit mathemati-
cians had treated everyone else on Wall Street with utter disdain.
Merrill Lynch, the firm that had brought Long-Term into being, had
long tried to establish a profitable, mutually rewarding relationship
with the fund. So had many other banks. But Long-Term had spurned
them. The professors had been willing to trade on their terms and
only on theirs--not to meetthe banks halfway. The bankers did not
like it that the once haughty Long-Term was pleading for their help.
And the bankers themselveswere hurting from the turmoil that
Long-Term had helped to unleash. Goldman Sachs's CEO, Jon
Corzine,was facing a revolt by his partners, who were horrified by
Goldman's recent trading losses and who, unlike Corzine, did not
want to use their diminishing capital to help acompetitor. Sanford I.
Weill, chairman of Travelers/Salomon Smith Barney, had suffered big
losses,too. Weill was worried that the losseswould jeopardize his
company's pending merger with Citicorp, which Weill saw as the
crowning gem to his lustrous career. He had recently shuttered his
own arbitrage unit--which, years earlier, had been the launching pad
forMeriwether'scareer--and was not keen to bail out another one.

INTRODUCTION \225xxi
As McDonough looked around the table, every one of his guests
was in greater or lesser trouble, many of them directly on account of
Long-Term.The value of the bankers' stocks had fallen precipitously.
The bankers were afraid, aswas McDonough, that the global storm
that had begun, so innocently, with devaluations in Asia, and had
spread to Russia, Brazil, and now to Long-TermCapital, would en-
velop all of Wall Street.
Richard Fuld, chairman of Lehman Brothers, was fighting off ru-
mors that his companywas on the verge of failing due to its supposed
overexposure to Long-Term D. avid Solo, who represented the giant
Swiss bank Union Bank ofSwitzerland, thought his bank was already
in far too deeply; it had foolishly invested in Long-Term and had suf-
fered titanic losses. Thomas Labrecque's Chase Manhattan had spon-
sored a loan to the hedge fund of $500 million; before Labrecque
thought about investing more, he wanted that loan repaid.
David Komansky, the portly Merrill chairman, was worried most
ofall. In a matter of two months, Merrill'sstock had fallen by half--
St9 billion of its market value had simply melted away. Merrill had
suffered shocking bond-trading losses,too. Now its own credit rating
was at risk.
Komansky, who personally had invested almost $t million in the
fund, was terrified of the chaos that would result if Long-Term col-
lapsed. But he knew how much antipathy there was in the room
toward Long-Term.He thought the odds of getting the bankers to
agree were long at best.
Komansky recognized that Cayne, the maverick Bear Stearnschief
executive, would be a pivotal player. Bear, which cleared Long-Term's
trades, knew the guts of the hedge fund better than any other firm.
As the other bankers nervously shifted in their seats, Herbert Allison,
Komansky's number two, asked Cayne where he stood.
Cayne stated his position clearly: Bear Stearnswould not invest a
nickel in Long-Term Capital.
For a moment the bankers, the cream of Wall Street, were silent.
And then the room exploded.

into gains. It is possible to pinpoint the moment of Meriwether's rev-
elation. In t979, a securities dealer namedJ. E Eckstein & Co. was
on the brink of failing. A panicked Eckstein went to Salomon and
met with a group that included severalofSalomon's partners and also
Meriwether, then a cherub-faced trader of thirty-one. \"I got a great
trade, but 1 can't stay in it,\" Eckstein pleaded with them. \"How
about buying me out?\"
The situation was this: Eckstein traded in Treasury bill futures--
which, asthe namesuggests, are contracts that provide for the deliv-
ery of U.S. Treasury bills, at a fixed price in the future. They often
traded at a slight discount to the price of the actual, underlying bills.
In a classic bit of arbitrage, Eckstein would buy the futures, sell the
bills, and then wait for the two prices to converge. Sincemost people
would pay about the same to own a bill in the proximate future as
they would to own it now, it was reasonable to think that the prices
would converge. And there was a bit ofmagic in the trade, which was
the secret of Eckstein's business, ofLong-TermCapital's future busi-

ness, and indeed of every arbitrageur who has ever plied the trade.
Eckstein didn't know whether the two securities' prices would go up
or down, and Ecksteindidn't care. All that mattered to him was how
the two prices would change relativeto each other.
By buying the bill futures and shorting (that is, betting on a decline
in the prices of) the actual bills, Eckstein really had two bets going,
each in opposite directions.* Depending on whether prices moved up
or down, he would expect to make money on onetrade and lose it on
the other. But as long as the cheaper asset--thefutures--rose by a
little more (or fell by a little less) than did the bills, Eckstein's profit
on his winning trade would be greater than his losson the other side.
This is the basic idea of arbitrage.
Eckstein had made this bet many times, typically with success. As
he mademore mone,v, he gradually raised his stake. Forsome reason,
in June 1979, the normal pattern was reversed: futures got moreex-
pensive than bills. Confident that the customary relationship would
reassert itself, Eckstein put on a very big trade. But instead of con-
verging, the gap widened even further. Eckstemwas hit with massive
margin calls and becamedesperate to sell.
Meriwether, as it had happened, had recently set up a bond-
arbitrage group within Salomon. He instantly saw that Eckstein's
trade made sense, becausesooneror later, the prices should converge.
But in the meantime, Salomon would be risking tens of millions of its
capital, which totaled only about $2oo million. The partners were
nervous but agreed to take over Eckstein'sposition. For the next cou-
ple ofweeks, the spread continued to widen, and Salomonsuffereda
serious loss. The firm's capital account used to be scribbled in a little
book, left outside the officeofa partner named Allan Fine, and each
afternoon the partners would nervously tiptoe over to Fine's to see
how much they had lost.Meriwether coolly insisted that they would
comeout ahead. \"We better,\" John Gutfreund, the managing partner,
told him, \"or you'll be fired.\"
The prices did converge, and Salomonmadeabundle. Hardly any-
one traded financial futures then, but Meriwether und'erstood them.

They must return the security later--by which time, they believe, the pricc will
have declined. The principle of buying cheap and selling dear still holds. Short
sellers merely reverse the order: sell dear, then buy cheap.

little section, the inauspiciously titled Domestic Fixed Income Arbi-
trage Group, now had carte blanche to do spread trades with Sa-
lomon'scapital. Meriwether, in fact, had found his life'swork.
Born in \177947,Meriwether had grown up in the Rosemoor section
of Roseland on the South Side of Chicago, a Democratic, Irish
Catholic stronghold of Mayor Richard Daley.He was one of three
children but part of a larger extended family, including four cousins
across an alleyway. In reality, the entire neighborhood was family.
Meriwether knew virtually everyone in the area, a self-contained
world that revolved around the basketball lot, soda shop, and parish.
It was bordered to the east by the tracks of the Illinois Central Rail-
road and to the north by a red board fence, beyond which lay a
no-man's-land of train yards and factories. If it wasn't a poor neigh-
borhood, it certainly wasn't rich. Meriwether's father was an ac-
countant; his mother worked for the Board of Education. Both
parents were strict. The Meriwethers lived in a smallish, cinnamon-
brick house with a trim lawn and tidy garden, much asmost of their
neighbors did. Everyone sent their children to parochial schools (the
few who didn't were ostracized as \"publics\.") Meriwether, attired in
a pale blue shirt and dark blue tie, attended St. John de la Salle Ele-
mentary and later Mendel Catholic High School, taught by Augus-
tinian priests. Discipline was harsh. The boys wererapped with a
ruler or, in the extreme, made to kneelon their knuckles for an entire
class. Educated in such a Joycean regime, Meriwether grew up ac-
customed to a pervasive sense of order. As one of Meriwether's
friends,a barber's son, recalled, \"We were afraid to goof around at
lelementaryl school because the nuns would punish you for life and
you'd be sent to Hell.\" As for their mortal destination, it was said,
only half in jest, that the young men of Rosemoorhad threechoices:
go to college, become a cop, or go to jail. Meriwether had no doubt
about his own choice,nor did any of his peers.
Apopular, bright student, he was seemingly headedforsuccess.He
qualified for the National Honor Society,scoring especially high
marks in mathematics--an indispensable subject for a bond trader.
Perhaps the orderlinessof mathematics appealed to him. He wasever
guided by a sense of restraint, as if to step out of bounds would in-
vite the ruler's slap. Although Meriwether had a bit of a mouth on
him, as one chum recalled, he never got into serious trouble. \17P7rivate
with his feelings, he kept any reckless impulse strictly under wraps

and cloaked his drive behind a comely reserve.Hewas clever but not
a prodigy, well liked but not a standout. He was, indeed, average
enough in a neighborhood and time in which it would have been hell
to have been anything but average.
Meriwetheralso liked to gamble, but only when the oddswere suf-
ficiently in his favor to give him an edge. Gambling, indeed, was a
field in which his cautious approach to risk-taking could be applied
to his advantage. He learned to bet on horsesand also to play black-
jack, the latter courtesy of a card-playing grandma. Parlaying an in-
nate sense of the odds, he would bet on the Chicago Cubs, but not
until he got the weather report so he knew how the winds would be
blowing at Wrigley Field. 2 His first foray into investmentswas at age
twelve or so, but it would be wrong t(\177suggest that it \177ccurred to any
of his peers, (\177reven to Meriwether himself, that this modestly built,
chestnut-haired boy was a Horatio Alger herodestined for glory on
Wall Street. \"John and his older brother made money in high school
buying stocks,\" his motherrecalleddecades later. \"His father advised
him.\" And that was that.
Meriwether made his escape from Rosemoor by means of a singu-
lar passion:not investing but golf. From an early age, he had haunted
the courses at public parks, an unusual pastime for a Rosemoor boy.
He wasa standout member of the Mendel school team and twice
won the Chicag(\177 Suburban Catholic Leaguegolf tournament. He
also caddied at the Flossmoor Country Club, which involved a sig-
nificant train or bus ride south of the city. The superintendents at
Flossmoortooka shine to the earnest, likable young man and let him
caddy for the richest players--a lucrative privilege. One of the mem-
bers tabbed him for a Chick Evans scholarship,named f\177ran early-
twentieth-century golfer who had had the happy idea of endowing a
college scholarship for caddies. Meriwether picked Northwestern
University, in Evanston, Illinois, on the chilly waters \177fLake Michi-
gan, twenty-five milesand a world away from Rosem\177or. His life
story up to then had highlighted two rather conflicting verities. The
first was the sense of well-being to be derived from fitting into a
group such as a neighborhood or church: from religi\177usly adhering
to its values and rites.Order and custom were virtues in themselves.
But second, Meriwether had learned, it paid to develop an edge--a
low handicap at a game that nobody else on the bMck even played.
After Northwestern, he taught high school math f\177r a year, then

MERIWETHER \2257
went to the University of Chicago for a business degree, where a
grain farmer's son named Jon Corzine (later Meriwether's rival on
Wall Street) was one of his classmates. Meriwether worked his way
through business school asan analyst at CNA Financial Corporation,
and graduated in \177973. The next year, Meriwether, now a sturdily
built twenty-seven-year-old with beguiling eyesand round, dimpled
cheeks,was hired by Salomon. It was still a small firm, but it was in
the center ofgreat changes that were convulsing bond markets every-
where.
Until the mid-\17796os, bond trading had beena dull sport. An in-
vestor bought bonds, often from the trust department of his local
bank, for steady income, and as long as the bonds didn't default, he
wasgenerally happy with his purchase, if indeed he gave it any fur-
ther thought. Few investors actively traded bonds, and the notion of
managing a bond portfolio to achieve a higher return than the next
,\177t\17o7ry, say, to beat a benchmark index, was totally foreign. That was
a good thing, because no such index existed.The reigning bond guru
was Salomon's own Sidney Homer, a Harvard-educated classicist,
distant relative of the painter Winslow Homer,and son of a Metro-
politan Opera soprano. Homer, author of the massive tome A His-
lory of Interest Rates: 2000 Be. to the Present, was a gentleman
scholar--a breed on Wall Street that was shortly to disappear.
Homer's markets, at least in contrast to those of today, werechar-
acterized by fixed relationships: fixed currencies, regulated interest
rates, and a fixed gold price($35 an ounce). But the epidemic of in-
flation that infected the West in the late \17796os destroyed this cozy
world forever. As inflation rose, so did interest rates, and those gilt-
edgedbonds, bought when a 4 percent rate seemed attractive, lost
half their value or more. In \17797t, the United States freed the gold
price; then the Arabs embargoed oil. If bondholders still harbored
any illusion of stability, the bankruptcy of the Penn Central Railroad,
which was widely owned by blue-chip accounts,wrecked the illusion
forever. Bond investors, most of them knee-deep in losses, were no
longer comfortable standing pat. Gradually, governments around the
globe were forced to drop their restrictions on interest rates and on
currencies.The world of fixed relationships was dead.
Soybeans suddenly seemed quaint; money was the hot commodity
now. Futures exchanges devised new contracts in financial goods
such as Treasury billsand bonds and Japanese yen, and everywhere

==================================================

8 \225WHEN GENIUS FAILED
there were new instruments, new options, new bonds to trade, just
when professional portfolio managers were waking up and wanting
to trade them. By the end of the .97os, firms such as Salomon were
slicing and dicing bonds in ways that Homer had never dreamed of:
blending mortgages together, for instance, and distilling them into
bite-sized, easily chewablesecurities.
The other big change was the computer. As late as the end of the
t96os , whenevertraders wanted to price a bond, they would look it
up in a thick blue book. In \177969, Salomon hired a mathematician,
Martin Leibowitz, who got Salomon's first computer. Leibowitz be-
came the most popular mathematician in history, or so it seemed
when the bond market was hot and Salomon'straders, who no longer
had time to page through the blue book, crowded around him to get
bond prices that they now needed on the double. By the early \17797os,
traders had their own crude handheld calculators, which subtly
quickened the rhythm of the bond markets.
Meriwether, who joined Salomon on the financing desk, known as
the Repo Department, got there just as the bond world was turning
topsy-turvy. Once predictable and relatively low risk, the bond world
was pulsating with change and opportunity, especially for younger,
sharp-eyed analysts. Meriwether, who didn't know a soul when he
arrived in New York, rented a room at a Manhattan athletic club and
soon discovered that bonds were made for him. Bonds have a partic-
ular appeal to mathematical types becauseso much of what deter-
mines their value is readily quantifiable. Essentially, two factors
dictate a bond's price.One can be gleaned from the coupon on the
bond itself. If you can lend money at xo percent today, you would pay
a premium for a bond that yielded xz percent. How much of a pre-
mium? That would depend on the maturity of the bond, the timing of
the payments, your outlook (if you have one)forinterest rates in the
future, plus all manner of wrinkles devised by clever issuers, such as
whether the bond is callable, convertible into equity, and so forth.
The other factor is the risk of default. In most cases, that is not
strictly quantifiable, nor is it very great. Still, it exists. General Elec-
tric is a good risk, but not as good as UncleSam. Hewlett-Packard is
somewhat riskier than GE; Amazon.com, riskier still. Therefore,
bond investors demanda higher interest rate when they lend to Ama-
zon as compared with GE, or to Boliviaas compared with France.
Deciding how much higher is the heart of bond trading, but the point

is that bonds trade on a mathematical spread. The riskier the bond,
the wider the spread--that is, the greater the difference between the
yield on it and the yield on (virtually risk free)Treasurys. Generally,
though not always, the spread alsoincreases with time--that is, in-
vestors demand a slightly higher yield on a two-year note than on a
thirty-day Hill because the uncertainty isgreater.
These rules are the catechism of bond trading; they ordain a vast
matrix of yields and spreads on debt securities throughout the world.
They are as intricate and immutable as the rules of a great religion,
and it is no wonder that Meriwether, who kept rosary beads and
prayercards in his briefcase, found them satisfying. Eager to learn, he
pepperedhisbosses with questions like a divinity student. Sensing his
promise, the suits at Salomon put him to trading government agency
bonds. Soon after, New York City nearly defaulted, and the spreads
on various agency bonds soared. Meriwether reckoned that the mar-
ket had goofed--surely, not every government entity was about to go
bust--and he bought all the bonds he could. Spreadsdid contract,
and Meriwether's trades made millions. \177
The Arbitrage Group, which he formed in 1977, marked a subtle
but important shift in Salomon's evolution. It was also the model that
l,ong-Term Capital was to replicate, brick for brick, in the \17979os--a
laboratory in which Meriwether would become accustomed to, and
comfortable with, taking big risks. Although Salomon had always
traded bonds, its primary focus had been the relatively safer business
of buying and selling bondsforcustomers. But the Arbitrage Group,
led by Meriwether, became a principal, risking Salomon's own capi-
tal. Becausethe fieldwas new, Meriwether had few competitors, and
the pickings were rich. As in the Eckstein trade, he often bet that a
spread--say, between a futures contract and the underlying bond, or
between two bonds--would converge. He couldalso bet on spreads
to widen, but convergence was his dominant theme. Thepeople on
the other side of his trades might be insurers, banks, or speculators;
Meriwether wouldn't know, and usually he wouldn't care. Occasion-
ally, these other investors might get scaredand withdraw their capi-
tal, causing spreads to widen further and causing Meriwether to lose
money, at least temporarily. But if he had the capital to stay the
course, he'd be rewarded in the long run, or so his experience seemed
to prove. Eventually, spreads always came in; that was the lesson he
had learned from the Eckstein affair, and it was a lesson he would

count on, years later, at Long-Term Capital. But there wasa different
lesson, equally valuable, that Meriwether might have drawn from the
Eckstein business, had his success not come so fast: while a losing
trade may well turn around eventually (assuming, of course, that it
was properly conceived to begin with), the turn could arrive too late
to do the trader any good--meaning, of course, that he might go
broke in the interim.
\225
By the early \17798os, Meriwether was one of Salomon's bright young
stars. His shyness and implacable poker face played perfectly to his
skill as a trader. William Mclntosh, the Salomon partner who had in-
terviewed him, said, \"John has asteel-trap mind. You have no clue to
what he's thinking.\" Meriwether's former colleague, the writer
Michael Lewis, echoed this assessment of Meriwether in Liar's Poker:
He wore the same blank half-tense expression whc,\177 hc won as
he did when he lost. He had, I think, a prof(\177tmd ability to con-
trol the two emotions that commonly destroytraders--fear and
greed--and it made him as nobleas a man wh\177 pursues his self-
interest so fiercelycanbe.

cipline, as opposed to the folkloric, unscientific Neanderthals who
traded from their bellies? Academia was teeming with nerdy mathe-
maticians who had been publishing unintelligible dissertations on
markets for years. Wall Street had started to hire them, but only for
research, where they'd be out of harm's way. On Wall Street, the
eggheads were stigmatized as \"quants,\" unfit for the man's game of
trading. Craig Coats, Jr., head of government-bond trading at Sa-
lomon, was a type typical of trading floors: tall, likable, handsome,
bound to get along with clients. Sure, he had beena goof-off in col-
lege, but he had played forward on the basketball team, and he had
trading in his heart. It was just this element of passion that Meri-
wether wanted to eliminate;hepreferred the cool discipline of schol-
ars, with their rigorous and highly quantitative approach to markets.
Most Wall Street executives were mystified by the academic world,
but Meriwether, a math teacher with an M.B.A. from Chicago, was
comfortable with it. That would be his edge. In \177983, Meriwether
called Eric Rosenfeld,a sweet-natured MIT-trained Harvard Business
School assistant professor, to see if Rosenfeld could recommend any
of his students. The son of a modestly successful Concord, Massa-
chusetts, money manager, Rosenfeld was a computer freak who had
already been using quantitative methods to make investments. At
Harvard, he was struggling.- Laconic and dry, Rosenfeld was com-
pellingly bright, but he was less than commanding in a classroom. At
a distance, he looked like a thin, bespectacled mouse. The students
were tough on him; \"they beat the shit out of him,\" according to a
future colleague. Rosenfeld, who was grading exams when Meri-
wether called and was making, as he recalled, roughly $30,000 a
year, instantly offered to audition for Salomon himself. Ten days
later, he was hired. \177
Meriwether didn't stop there. After Rosenfeld, he hired Victor J.
Haghani,an Iranian American with a master's degree in finance from
the l.ondon School of Economics; Gregory Hawkins, an Arkansan
who had helped run Bill Clinton's campaign for state attorney gen-
eral and had then gotten a Ph.D. in financial economics from MIT;
and William Krasker,an intense, mathematically minded economist
with a Ph.D. from--onceagain--MIT and a colleague of Rosenfeld
at Harvard. Probably the nerdiest, and surely the smartest, was
Lawrence Hilibrand, who had two degrees from MIT. Hilibrand was
hired by Salomon's research department, the traditional home of

12 \225WHEN GENIUS FAILED
quants, but Meriwether quickly moved him into the Arbitrage
Group, which, of course, was the heart of the future Long-Term Cap-
ital.
The eggheads immediately took to Wall Street. They downloaded
into their computers all of the past bond prices they could get their
hands on. They distilled the bonds' historicalrelationships, and they
modeled how these prices should behave in the future. And then,
when a market price somewhere, somehowgot out of line, the com-
puter models told them.
Themodelsdidn'torder them to trade; they provided acontextual
argument for the human computers to consider.They simplified a
complicated world. Maybe the yield on two-year Treasury noteswas
a bit closer than it ordinarily was to the yield on ten-year bonds; or
maybe the spread between the two was unusually narrow, compared
with a similar spread for some other country's paper. The models
condensedthe markets into a pointed inquiry. As one of the group
said, \"Given the state of things around the world--the shape of yield
curves, volatilities, interest rates--are the financial markets making
statements that are inconsistent with each other?\" This is how they
talked, and this is how they thought. Every price was a \"statement\";
if two statements were in conflict, there might be an opportunity for
arbitrage.
The whole experiment would surely have failed, except for two
happy circumstances. First, the professors u\177ere smart. They stuck to
their knitting, and opportunities were plentiful, especially in newer
markets such asderivatives.Theprofessorsspoke of opportunities as
inefficiencies; in a perfectly efficient market, in which all prices were
correct,noone would have anything to trade..Since \177hcmarkets they
traded in were still evolving, though, priceswere ot\177t'n incorrect and
there were opportunities aplenty. Moreover, \177hepv\177tessors brought
to the job an abiding credo, learned from academia, that over time,
all markets tend to get moreefficient.
In particular, they believed, spreads betwce\177 \177iskier alld less risky
bonds would tend to narrow. This followed logically because spreads
reflect, in part, the uncertainty that is attached \177o\177hzmcicr assets.
Over time, if markets did become more efficient, suCh riskier bonds
would beless w)latile and therefore more certain seeming, and so the
premium demanded by investors wouhl tend to slumk. In the early
I98os ,for instance, the spreads on swaps--a lype ot t]eriv,llivc trade,

of which more later--were z percentage points. \"They looked at this
and said, 'It can't be right; there can't be that much risk,\" a junior
member of Arbitrage recalled. \"They said, 'There is going to beasec-
ular trend toward a more efficient market.'\"
And swap spreads did tighten--to i percentagepoint and eventu-
ally to a quarter point. All of Wall Street did this trade, including the
Salomon government desk, run by the increasingly wary Coats. The
difference was that Meriwether's Arbitrage Group did it in very big
dollars. If a trade went against them, the arbitrageurs, especially the
ever-confident Hilibrand, merely redoubled the bet. Backed by their
models, they felt more certain than others did--almost invincible.
Given enough time, given enough capital, the young geniuses from
academe felt they could do no wrong, and Meriwether, who regularly
journeyed to academic conferences to recruit such talent, beganto be-
lieve that the geniuses were right.
That was the second happy circumstance: the professors had a
protector who shielded them from company politics and got them the
capital to trade. But for Meriwether, the experiment couldn't have
worked; the professors were simply too out ofplace. Hilibrand, an
engineer's son from Cherry Hill, New Jersey,waslike an academic
version of AI Gore; socially awkward, he answered the simplest-
seeming questions with wooden and technical--albeit mathemati-
cally precise--replies. Once, a trader not in the Arbitrage Group tried
to talk Hilibrand out of buying and selling a certain pair of securities.
Hilibrand replied, as if conducting a tutorial, \"But they are priced
so egregiously.\"His colleague, accustomed to the profane banter
of the trading floor, shot back, \"I was thinking the same thing--
'egregiously'!\" Surrounded by unruly traders, the arbitrageurs were
quiet intellectuals. Krasker, the cautious professorwho built many of
the group's models,had all the charisma of a tabletop. Rosenfeld had
a wry sense of humor, but in a firm in which many of the partners
hadn't goneto college, much less graduate school at MIT,hewas shy
and taciturn.
Meriwether had the particular genius to bring this group to Wall
Street--a move that Salomon's competitors would later imitate. \"He
took a bunch of guys who in the corporate world wereconsidered
freaks,\" noted Jay Higgins, then an investment banker at Salomon.
\"Those guys would be playing with their sliderulesat BellLabs if it
wasn't for John, and they knew it. ''\177

The professors were brilliant at reducing a trade to plusesand mi-
nuses; they could strip a ham sandwich to its component risks; but
they could barely carry on a normal conversation. Meriwether cre-
ated a safe, self-containedplace for them to develop their skills;he
adoringly made Arbitrage into a world apart. Because of Meriwether,
the traders fraternized with one another, and they didn't feel the need
to fraternize with anyone else.
Meriwether would say, \"We're playing golf on Sunday,\" and he
didn't have to add, \"I'd like you to be there.\" The traders who
hadn't played golf before,such as Hilibrand and Rosenfeld, quickly
learned. Meriwether also developed a passion for horses and ac-
quired some thoroughbreds; naturally, he took his traders to the
track, too. He even shepherded the gang and their spouses to Antigua
every year. Hedidn't want them just during trading hours, he wanted
all of them, all the time. He nurtured his traders, all the while build-
ing a protective fence around the group as sturdy as the red board
fence in Rosemoor.
Typical of Meriwether,he made gambling an intimate part of the
group's shared life. The arbitrageurs devisedelaborate betting pools
over golf weekends; they bet on horses; they took day trips to At-
lantic City together.Theybetonelections. They bet on anything that
aroused their passion for odds. When they talked sports, it wasn't
about the game; it was about the point spread.
Meriwether loved for his traders to play liar's poker, a game that
involves making poker hands from the serial numbers on dollar
bills. He liked to test his traders; he thought the g\177me honed their
instincts, and he would get churlish and thrc\177ltc\177 to quit when they
played poorly. It started as fun, but then it got serious; the traders
would play for hours, occasionally for st:\177kcs m the tells of thou-
sandsofdollars. Rosenfeld kept an envelope stuffed with hundreds
of single bills in his desk. Then, when it sccmcd theft ccrtail\177 bills
were cropping up too often, they did away with bills a\177d got \177com-
puter to generate random lists of humidors. The Arbitrage boys
seemed addicted to gambling: \"You could \177cvcr go out to dinner
with J.M.'s guys without playing liar's poker to sec wh\177 would pick
up the check,\"Gerald Rosenfeld, Salomon's chief fina\177cinl officer,
recalled. Meriwether was a good player,and so w\177s Eric Rose,field
(no relation), who had an inscrutable poker face. The straight-
arrow Hilibrand was a bit too literal.He was mc;\177pablc \177flying and

for a long time never bluffed; mustachioed and eerily intelligent, he
had a detachment that was almost extrahuman. Once, when asked
whether it was awkward to have a wife who worked in mortgages
(which Hilibrand traded), he answered flatly, \"Well, I never talk to
\177lywife about business.\"
The Arbitrage Group, about twelve in all, became incredibly close.
They sat in a double row ofdesks in the middle of Salomon's raucous
trading floor, which was the model for the investment bank in Tom
Wolfe'sThe Bonfire of the Vanities. Randy Hiller, a mortgage trader
in Arbitrage, found its cliquish aspect overbearingand left. Another
defector was treated likea traitor; Meriwether vengefully ordered the
crew not to even golf with him. But very few traders left, and those
who remained all but worshiped Meriwether. They spoke of him in
hushed tones, as ofaMoses who had brought their tribe to Palestine.
Meriwether didn't exactly return the praise, but he gave them some-
thing more worthwhile. Hisinterestand curiosity stimulated the pro-
fessors; it challenged them and made them better. And he rewarded
them with heartfelt loyalty. He never screamed, but it wouldn't have
mattered if he had. To the traders, the two initials \"J.M.\"--for that
was his unfailing sobriquet--were as powerful as any two letters
could be.
Though he had a private office upstairs, Meriwether usually sat on
the trading floor, at a tiny desk squeezed in with the others. He would
chain-smoke while doing Eurodollar trades, and supervise the pro-
lessors by asking probing questions. Somehow, he sheathed great am-
bition in an affecting modesty. He liked to say that he never hired
anyonewho wasn't smarter than he was. He didn't talk about him-
self, but no one noticed because he was genuinely interested in what
the others weredoing.He didn't build the models, but he grasped
what the models were saying. And he trusted the models because his
guys had built them. One time, a trader named Andy who was losing
money on a mortgage trade asked for permissionto doubleup, and
J.M. gave it rather offhandedly. \"Don't you want to know more
about this trade?\" Andy asked. Meriwether's trusting reply deeply af-
fected the trader.J.M.said, \"My trade was when I hired you.\"
Meriwether had married Mimi Murray, a serious equestrian from
California, in \17798\177,and the two of them lived in a modest two-
bedroom apartment on York Avenue on the Upper East Side. They
wanted children, according to a colleague, but remained childless.

\225WHEN GENIUS FAILED
Aside from Mimi, J.M.'s family was Salomon. He didn't leave his
desk even for lunch; in fact, his noontime was as routinized as the
professors' models. Salomondid achina-service lunch, and for a long
time, every day, a waiter would waft over to Meriwether bearing a
bologna sandwich on white bread, two apples, and a Tab hidden
under a silver dome. J.M. would eat one of the apples and randomly
offer the other to oneof the troops as a sort of token. The rest of the
gang might order Chinese food, and if any sauce leaked onto his
desk, J.M., his precious territory violated, would scowl and say,
\"Look, I guess I'm going to have to give up my desk and go backto
my office and work there.\"
A misfit among Wall Street's Waspish bankers, J.M. identified
more with the parochial schoolboyshe had grown up with than with
the rich executives whose number he had joined. Unlike other fi-
nanciers in the roaring eighties, who were fast becoming trendy
habitu& of the social pages, Meriwether disdained attention (he
purged his picture from Salomon's annual report) and refused to dine
on any food that smacked of French. When in Tokyo, he went to
McDonald's. Ever an outsider, he molded his group into a tribe of
outsidersas cohesive, loyal, and protective as the world he had left in
Rosemoor. His cohorts were known by schoolboy nicknames such as
Vic, the Sheik, E.R., and Hawk.
Although J.M. knew his markets, his reputation as a trader was
overwrought. His real skill was in shaping people, which he did in
singularly understated style. He was awkward when speaking to a
group; his words came out in uneven bunches, leaving others to piece
together their meaning.'\" But his confidence in his troops was written
on his face, and it worked on their spirits like a tonic. Combined with
the traders' uncommon self-confidence, Meriwether's faith in them
was a potent but potentially combustible mix. It inflated their already
supreme self-assurance. Moreover, J.M.'s willingness to bankroll
Hilibrand and the others with Salomon's capital dangerously condi-
tioned the troops to think that they would always have access to
more.
As Arbitrage made more money, the group's turl inevitably ex-
panded. Meriwether, eclipsing rivals such as Coats, gained command
over all bond trading, including government bonds, mortgages,
high-yield corporate bonds, European bonds, and Japanese war-
rants. It seemed logical, for the group to apply its models in new and

greener pastures. But others in Salomon began to seethe. J.M. would
sendone of his boys--Hilibrand or Victor Haghani--to Salomon's
London office or its Tokyo office,and the emissary would declare,
\"This trade is very good, but you should be ten times bigger in it.\"
Not two times, but ten times! As if they couldn't fail. Hilibrand and
Haghani were in their twenties, and they might be talking to guys
twice their age. Then they started to say, \"Don't do this trade; we're
better at this than anyone else, so we'll do all of this trade on the ar-
bitragedesk.\"
Hilibrand was particularly annoying. He was formal and polite,
but he struck old hands ascondescending i, nfuriating them with his
mathematical certitude. One time, he tried to persuade some com-
modity traders that they should bet on oilprices following a pattern
similar to that of bond prices. The traders listened dubiously while
Hilibrand bobbed his headback and forth. Suddenly he raised a hand
and sonorously declaimed, \"Consider the following hypothesis.\" It
was as if he were delivering an edict from on high, to be etched in
Stofle.
Traders had an anxious life;they'd spend the day shouting into a
phone, hollering across the room, and nervously eyeballing a com-
puter screen. The Arbitrage Group, right in the middle of this con-
trolled pandemonium, seemed to be a mysterious, privileged
subculture. Half the time, the boys were discussing trades in obscure,
esoteric language, as if in a seminar; the other half, they were laugh-
ing and playing liar's poker. In their cheap suits and with their
leisurely mien, they could seemingly cherry-pick the besttrades while
everyone else worked at a freneticpace.
The group was extremely private; it seemed to have adopted J.M.'s
innate secretiveness as a protective coloring. Though any trader is
well advised to bediscreet, the professors' refusal to share any infor-
mation with their Salomoncolleagues fueled the resentment felt by
Coats and others. Though Arbitrage soaked up all of the valuable tid-
bits that passed through a premier bond-trading floor, it set up its
own private research arm and strictly forbade others in Salomon to
learn about its trades. One time, the rival Prudential-Bache hired
away a Salomon mortgage trader, which was considered a coup.
\"What was the first thing he wanted?\" a then-Pru-Bache manager
laughingly remembered. \"Analytics? Better computer system or soft-
ware?No.He wanted locks on the filing cabinet. It reflected their

mentality!\" Driven by fanatical loyalty to Meriwether, the Arbitrage
Group nurtured an us-against-them clannishness that would leave the
future Long-Term dangerously remote from the rest of Wall Street.
Hilibrand became so obsessed with his privacy that he evenrefused
to let Salomon Brothers take his picture.\"
\225
As other areas of Salomonfloundered, Arbitrage increasingly threw
its weight around. Hilibrand pressed the firm to eliminate investment
banking, which, he argued with some justification, took home to()
much in bonuses and was failing to carry its weight. Thenhedeclared
that Arbitrage shouldn't have to pay for its share of the company
cafeteria, because the group didn't eat there. True to his right-wing,
libertarian principles, Hilibrand complained about being saddled
with \"monopoly vendors,\" as if every trader and every clerk should
negotiate his own deal for lunch. The deeper truth was that Hilibrand
and his mates in Arbitrage had little respect for their mostly older Sa-
lomon colleagueswhoworked in other areas of the\" firm. \"It was like
they were a capsule inside a spaceship,\" Higgins said of J.M.'s un-
derlings. \"They didn't breathe the air that everyb\177dy else did.\"
Hilibrand and Rosenfeld continually pressed I.M. f\177rmore money.
They viewed Salomon'scompensation arrangemem, which liberally
spread the wealth to all departments, as socialistic.Since Arbitrage
was making most of the money, they felt, they a\177d they alpine should
reap the rewards.
In \177987, the raider Ronald Perelman made a hostile, bid for Sa-
Iomon. Gutfreund feared, with ample justificati\177)\177, that if Perelman
won, Salomon's reputation as a trusted bankt'r woi\177ld go down the
tubes (indeed, Salomon's corporate clients o\177uld likely find them-
selves on Perelman's hit list). Gutfreund feladt'd I'crclmala off by sell-
ing control of the firm to a distinctly friendly investor, the billionaire
Warren Buffett. Hilibrand, who weighed everythm\177 m mathematical
terms, was incensedover what he reck\177ncd was a poor dcal for Sa-
Iomon. The twenty-seven-year-old wtmderki\177d,though unswervingly
honest himself, couldn't see that an inta\177giblt\" such as Sal(\177mon's eth-
ical image was also worth a price, tit\"actually fk'w \177ut to Omaha to

with loyalty to the greater firm. When the traders' protests got louder,
J.M. invited Hilibrand and Rosenfeldtoa dinner with William Mcln-
tosh, an older partner, to hear about Salomon's history. A liberal
Democrat in the Irish Catholic tradition, J.M. had astrongersense of
the firm's common welfare and agrace that softened the hard edge of
his cutthroat profession. He shrugged off his lieutenants' occasional
cries that Arbitrage should separate from Salomon. He would tell
them, 'Tve got loyalty to people here. And anyway, you're being
greedy. Lookat the people in Harlem.\" He pressed Salomon to clean
house, but not without showing concern for other departments.
Thoughtfully, when the need arose, he would tell the chief financial
officer, \"We have a big trade on;we could lose a lot--I just want you
to know.\" In the crash of 1987, Arbitrage did drop $12o million in
one day.'-' Others at Salomonweren't sure quite what the group was
doing or what its leverage was, but they instinctively trusted Meri-
wether. Even his rivals in the firm liked him. And then it all came
crashing down.
\225
Pressed by his young traders, who simply wouldn't give up, in i989
Meriwether persuaded Gutfreund to adopt a formula under which
his arbitrageurs would get paid a fixed, 15 percent share of the
group's profits. The deal was cut in secret, after Hilibrand had threat-
ened to bolt. '\177Typically, J.M. left himself out of the arrangement,
telling Gutfreund to pay him whatever he thought was fair. Then Ar-
bitrage had a banner year, and Hilibrand, who got the biggest share,
took home a phenomenal $23 million. Although Hilibrand modestly
continued to ride the train to work and drive aLexus,news of his pay
brought to the surface long-simmering resentments, particularly as
no other Salomon department was paid under such a formula. As
Charlie Munger, Buffett's partner and a Salomon director, put it,
\"The more hyperthyroid at Salomon went stark, raving mad.\"
In particular, a thirty-four-year-old trader named Paul Mozer was
enraged.Mozer had been part of Arbitrage, but acouple of years ear-
lier he had been forced to leave that lucrative area to run the govern-
ment desk. Mozer had a wiry frame, close-set eyes, and an intense
manner. In 199i , a year after the storm over Hilibrand's pay, Mozer
went to Meriwether and made a startling confession: he had submit-

ted a false bid to the U.S. Treasury to gain an unauthorized share of
a government-bond auction.
Stunned, Meriwether asked, \"Is there anything else?\" Mozer said
there wasn't.
Meriwether took the matter to Gutfreund. The pair, along with
two other top executives,agreed that the matter was serious, but they
somehow did nothing about it. Although upset with Mozer, Meri-
wether stayed loyal to him. It is hard to imagine the clannish, faith-
ful J.M. doing otherwise.He defended Mozer as a hard worker who
had slipped but once and left him in charge of the government desk.
This was a mistake--not anethical mistake but an error in judgment
brought on by J.M.'s singular code of allegiance. In fact, Mozer was
a volatile trader who--motivated more by pique than by a realistic
hope for profit--had repeatedly and recklessly broken the rules, jeop-
ardizing the reputation of Meriwether, his supervisor,and the entire
firm. It must besaid that Mozer's crime had been so foolishas to be
easily slipped by his superiors. Quite naturally, Meriwether, now
head of Salomon'sbond business, hadn't thought to inquire if one of
his traders had been lying to the U.S. Treasury. But J.M.'s lenience
after the fact is hard to fathom. A few months later, in August, Sa-
Iomon discovered that Mozer's confession to Meriwcthcr had itself
been a lie, for he had committed numerous other infractions, too.
Though now Salomon did report the matter, the Treasury and Fed
were furious. The scandal set off an uproar seemingly out of propor-
tion to the modest wrongdoing that had inspired it. '' No matter; one
simply did not---could not--deceive the U.S.Treasury. (;utfreund, a
lion of Wall Street, was forcedto quit.
Buffett flew in from Omaha and became the new, though interim,
CEO. He immediately asked the frazzled Salomou executives, \"Is
there any way we can saveJ.M.?\" Meriwcthc\177; o| com'sc, was the
firm's top moneymaker and known as impeccably ethical. \177listraders
heatedly defended him, pointing out that J.M. had immediately re-
ported the matter to his superior. But prcssmc moumcd on all in-
volved in the scandal. Mclntosh, the partner who had first brought
Meriwether into Salomon, trekked up to J.M.'s forty second-floor of-
rice and told him that he should quit for the go\177d \177|the firm. And

introspective person,\" he later noted to Business Week. '\177The full
truth was more bitter:J.M.was being pushed aside--even implicitly
blamed--despite, in his opinion, having done no wrong. This painful
dollop of limelight made him even more secretive, to Long-TermCap-
ital's later regret. Meanwhile, within the Arbitrage Group, resurrect-
ing J.M. became a crusade. Hilibrand and Rosenfeld kept J.M.'s
officeintact, with his golf club, desk, and computer, as if he were
merely on an extended holiday. Deryck Maughan, the new CEO, as-
tutely surmised that as long as this shrine to J.M. remained, J.M. was
alive as his potential rival. Sure enough, a year later, when Meri-
wether resolved his legal issues stemming from the Mozer affair, Hill-
brand and Rosenfeld, now the heads of Arbitrage and the
government desk, respectively,lobbied for J.M.'s return as co-CEO.*
Maughan, a bureaucrat, wastoo smart to go for this and tried to
refashion Salomon into a global, full-service bank, with Arbitrage as
a mere department. Hilibrand, who was dead opposed to this course,
increasingly asserted himself in J.M.'s absence. He wanted Salomon
to fire its investment bankers and retrench around Arbitrage. Mean-
while, he made a near-catastrophic bet in mortgages and fell behind
by $4oo million. Most traders in that situation would have called it
a day, but Hilibrand was just warming up; he coolly proposed that
Salomon double its commitment! Because Hilibrand believed in his
trade so devoutly, he could take pain as no other tradercould.He
said that the market was like a Slinky out of shape--eventually it
would spring back. It was said that only once had he eversuffereda
permanent loss, a testament to the fact that he was not a gambler, But
his supreme conviction in his own rightness cried out for some re-
straining influence, lest it develop arecklessedge.
Doubling up was too much, but management let Hilibrand keep
the trade he had. Eventually, it was profitable, but it reminded Sa-
lomon's managers that while Hilibrand was critiquing various de-
partments as being so much extra baggage, Arbitrage felt free to call
on Salomon's capital whenever it was down. The executives could
never agree on just how much capital Arbitrage was tying up or how
much risk its trades entailed, matters on which the dogmatic Hill-
*The Securities and Exchange Conm\177ission filed a civil complaint charging
that Mcriwether had failed to properly supervise Mozcr. Without admitting or
denying guilt, Meriwether settled the case, agreeing to a three-month suspension

brand lectured them for hours. In short, how much--if, sometime,
the Slinky did not bounce back-\177could Arbitrage potentially lose?
Neither Buffett nor Munger ever felt quite comfortable with the
mathematical tenor of Hilibrand's replies. \177Buffett agreed to take
J.M. back--but not, as Hilibrand wanted, to trust him with the en-
tire firm.
Of course, there was no way Meriwether would settle for such a
qualified homecoming. The Mozer scandal had ended any hope that
J.M. would take his place at the top of Salomon, but it had sown the
seeds ofagreater drama. Now forty-five, with hair that dipped in a
wavy, boyish arctoward impenetrableeyes,J.M. broke off talks with
Salomon. He laid plans fi)r a new and independent arbitrage fund,
perhaps a hedge fund, and he proceeded to raid the Arbitrage Group
that he had, so lovingly, assembled.

heights. Time and again, the market indexes soared past once unthink-
able barriers. Time and again, new records were set and old standards
eclipsed. Investors were giddy, but they were far from complacent. It
was agoldenage, but also a nervous one. Americans filled their empty

the market's latest move. Stock screenswere everywhere--in gyms, at

As far as securitieslaw is concerned, there is no such thing as a
hedge fund. In practice, the term refersto a limited partnership, at
least a small number of which have operated since the \17792os. Ben-
jamin Graham, known as the father of value investing, ran what was
perhaps the first. Unlike mutual funds, their more commoncousins,
these partnerships operate in Wall Street'sshadows; they are private
and largely unregulated investment pools for the rich. They need not
register with the Securitiesand ExchangeCommission, though some
must make limited filings to another Washington agency, the Com-
modity Futures Trading Commission. For the most part, they keep
the contents of their portfolios hidden.Theycan borrow as much as
they choose (oras much as their bankers will lend them--which often
amounts to the same thing). And, unlike mutual funds, they can con-
centrate their portfolios with no thought to diversification. In fact,
hedge funds are free to sample any or all of the more exoticspecies
of investment flora, such as options, derivatives, short sales,ex-
tremely high leverage, and so forth.
In return for such freedom, hedge funds must limit access to a se-
lect few investors; indeed, they operate like private clubs. By law,
funds can sign up no more than ninety-nine investors, people, or in-
stitutions each worth at least $1 million, or up to five hundred in-
vestors, assuming that each has a portfolio ofat least$5 million. The
implicit logic is that if a fund is ()pento only a small group of mil-
lionaires and institutions, agencies such as the SEC need not trouble
to monitor it. Presumably, millionaires know what they aredoing; if
not, their losses are nobody's business but their own.
Until recently, hedge fund managers were complete unknowns. But
in the t98os and '9os, a few large operators gained notoriety, most
notably the \177migr\177 currency speculator George Soros. In \177992,
Soros's Quantum Fund became celebrated for \"breaking\" the Bank
of England and forcing it to devalue the pound (which he had relent-
lesslysold short), a coup that netted him a $1 billion profit. A few
years later, Soros was blamed--perhaps unjustifiably--for forcing
sharp devaluations in Southeast Asian currencies. Thanks to Soros
and a few other high-profile managers, such as Julian Robertson and
Michael Steinhardt, hedge fund operators acquired an image of dar-
ing buccaneers capable of roiling markets. Steinhardt bragged that he
and his fellows were one of the few remaining bastions of frontier
capitalism.-' The popular image wasof swashbuckling risk takers who

==================================================

HEDGE FUND \22525
captured outsized profits or suffered horrendous losses; the ,998
Webster's CollegeDictionary defined hedge funds as those that use
\"high-risk speculative methods.\"
Despite their bravura image, however, most hedge funds are rather
tame; indeed, that is their true appeal. The term \"hedge fund\" is a col-
loquialism derived from the expression \"to hedge one's bets,\" meaning
to limit the possibility of loss on a speculation by betting on the other
side.This usage evolved from the notion of the common garden hedge
asa boundary or limit and was used by Shakespeare (\"England hedg'd
in with the maine'\.") No onehad thought to apply the term to an in-
vestment fund until Alfred Winslow Jones, the true predecessor of
Meriwether, organized a partnership in i949. 4Though such partner-
ships had long been in existence, Jones, an Australian-born Fortune
writer, was the first to run a balanced, or hedged, portfolio. Fearing
that his stocks would fall during general market slumps, Jonesdecided
to neutralize the market factor by hedging--that is, by going both long
and short. Like most investors, he bought stocks he deemed to be
cheap, but he also sold short seemingly overpriced stocks. At least in
theory, Jones's portfolio was \"market neutral.\" Any event--war, im-
peachment,achange in the weather--that moved the marketeither up
or down would simply elevateone half of Jones's portfolio and depress
the other half. His net return would depend only on his ability to sin-
gle out the relative best and worst.
Thisis a conservative approach, likely to makeless but also to lose
less, which appealed to the nervous investor of the \17979os. Eschewing
the daring ofSoros, most modern hedge funds boasted of their steadi-
ness as much as of their profits. Over time, they expected to make
handsome returns but not to track the broader market blip for blip.
Ideally, they would make as much asor more than generalized stock
funds yet hold their own when the averages suffered.
At a time when Americans compared investment returns as ob-
sessively as they once had soaring home prices, these hedge funds--
though dimly understood--attained a mysterious cachet, for they
had seemingly found a route to riches while circumventing the usual
risks. People at barbecues talked of nothing but their mutual funds,
but a mutual fund wasso--common! For people of means, for peo-
ple who summered in the Hamptons and decorated their homes with
Warhols, for patrons of the arts and charity dinners, investing in a
hedge fund denoted a certain status, an inclusion among Wall

Street's smartest and savviest. When the world was talking invest-
ments, what could be more thrilling than to demurely drop, at court-
side, the name of a young, sophisticated hedge fund manager who,
discreetly, shrewdly, and auspiciously, was handling one's resources?
Hedge funds becamea symbol of the richest and the best.Paradox-
ically, the princely fees that hedge fund managers charged enhanced
their allure, for who could get away with such gaudy fees except the
exceptionally talented? Not only did hedge fund managers pocket a
fat share of their investors' profits, they greedily claimed a percent-
age of the assets.
For such reasons, the number of hedge funds in the United States
exploded. In \177968, when the SEC went looking, it could find only
z\1775 of them. \17B7y the \17799os there were perhaps 3,000 (nooneknows
the exact number), spread among many investing styles and asset
types. Most were small; all told, they held perhaps $300 billion in
capital, compared with $3.z trillion in equity mutual funds. \17H7ow-
ever, investors were hungry for more. They were seeking an alterna-
tive to plain vanilla that was both bold and safe: not the riskiest
investing style but the most certain; not the loudest, merely the
smartest. Thiswasexactly the sort of hedge fund Meriwether had in
mind.
Emulating Alfred Jones, Meriwether envisioned that [.ong-Term
Capital Management would concentrateon \"relative value\" trades in
bond markets. Thus, Long-Term would buy some bonds and sell
someothers. It would bet on spreads betweenpairs of bonds to either
widen or contract. If interest rates in Italy were significantly higher
than in Germany, meaning that Italy's bondswere cheaper than Ger-
many's, a trader who invested in Italy and shorted Germany would
profit if, and as, this differential narrowed. This is a relatively low-
risk strategy. Since bonds usually rise and fall in sync, spreads don't
move as much as the bonds themselves. As with Jones's fund, Long-
Term would in theory be unaffected if markets rose or fell, oreven if
they crashed.
But there was one significant difference: Meriwether planned from
the very start that Long-Term would leverage its capital twenty to
thirty times or even more. This wasanecessary part of Long-Term's
strategy, because the gaps between the bonds it intended to buy and
those it intended to sell were, most often,minuscule. To make a de-
cent profit on such tiny spreads, Long-Term would have to multiply

==================================================

HEDGE FUND \22527
its bet many, many times by borrowing. The allure of this strategy is
apparent to anyone who has visited a playground. Just as a seesaw
enables a child to raise a much greater weight than he could on his
own, financial leverage multiplies your \"strength\"--that is, your
earning power--because it enables you to earn a return on the capi-
tal you have borrowedas well as on your own money. Of course,
your power to lose isalso multiplied. If for some reason Long-Term\177s
strategy ever failed, its losses would be vastly greater and accruemore
quickly; indeed, they might be life-threatening--an eventuality that
surely seemed remote.
Early in I993, Meriwether paid a call on Daniel Tully, chairman of
Merrill Lynch. Still anxious about the unfair tarnish on his name
from the Mozer affair, J.M. immediately asked, \"Am 1 damaged
goods?\" Tully saidhewasn't. Tully put Meriwether in touch with the
Merrill Lynch people who raised capital for hedge funds, and shortly
thereafter, Merrill agreedto take on the assignment of raising capital
for Long-Term.
J.M.'sdesignwas staggeringly ambitious. He wanted nothing less
than to replicate the Arbitrage Group, with its global reach and abil-
ity to take huge positions, but without the backing of Salomon's bil-
lions in capital, credit lines, information network, and seven
thousand employees. Having done so much for Salomon,hewas bit-
ter about having been forced into exile under a cloud and eagerto be
vindicated, perhaps by creating something better.
And Meriwether wanted to raise acolossal sum, $z-5 billion. (The
typical fund starts with perhaps \177percent as much.) Indeed, every-
thing about Long-Term was ambitious. Its fees would be considerably
higher than average.J.M. a\177d his partners would rake in z5 percent
of the profits, in addition to a yearly z percent charge on assets.
(Most funds took only zo percent of profits and \177percent on assets.)
Such fees,J.M. felt, were needed to sustain aglobaloperation--but
this only pointed to the far-reaching nature of his aspirations.
Moreover, the fund insisted that investors commitforat least three
years, an almost unheard-of lockup in the hedge fund world. The
lockup madesense; if fickle markets turned against it, Long-Term
would have a cushion of truly \"long-term\" capital; it would be the
bank that could tell depositors, \"Comeback tomorrow.\" Still, it was

asking investors to show enormous trust--particularlysinceJ.M. did
not have a formal track record to show them. While it was known
anecdotally that Arbitrage had accounted for most ofSalomon'sre-
cent earnings, the group's profits hadn't been disclosed. Even in-
vestors who had an inkling of what Arbitrage had earned had no
understanding ofhow it had earned it. The nuts and bolts--the mod-
els, the spreads, the exotic derivatives--were to()obscure. Moreover,
people had serious qualms about investing with Meriwether so soon
after he had beensanctioned by the SEC in the Mozer affair.
As Merrill began to chart a strategy for raising money, J.M.'s old
team began to peel off from Salomon. Eric Rosenfeld left early in
1993. Victor Haghani, the Iranian Sephardi, was next; he got an ova-
tion on Salomon's trading floor when he broke the news. In July,
Greg Hawkins quit. Although J.M. still lacked Hilibrand, who was
ambivalent in the face of Salomon's desperate pleas that he stay,
Meriwether was now hatching plans with a nucleus of his top traders.
He still felt a strong loyalty to his former colleagues, and he touch-
ingly offered the job of nonexecutive chairman to Gutfreund, Sa-
lomon's fallen chief\177on the condition that Gutfreund give up an
acrimonious fight that he was waging with Salomon for back pay.
Though overlooked, Gutfreund had played a pivotal role in the Ar-
bitrage Group's success:he had been the brake on the traders' occa-
sional tendencies to overreach. But it was not to be. At Long-Term,
J.M. would have to restrain his own disciples.
In any case, J.M. wanted more cachet than (;utfreund or even his
talented but unheralded young arbitrageurs coulddeliver.He needed
an edge--something to justify his bold plans with investors. He had
to recast his group, to showcase them as not just a bunch of bond
traders but as a grander experiment in finance. This time', it would
not do to recruit an unknown assistant profess(\177r--not if he wanted
to raise$z.5 billion. This time, Meriwcthcr wc\177t to the very top of
academia. Harvard's Robert C. Merton w\177s the Ice,cling scholar in fi-
nance, considered a genius by many in his fickL IIc had trained sev-
eral generations of Wall Street traders, mch\177ding Eric Rosenfeld. In
the \17798os, Rosenfeid had persuaded Morton to becomea consultant
to Salomon, so Merton was aiready friendly with the Arbitrage
Group. More important, Merton's was a name that would instantly
open doors, not only in America but also in Europe and AsL\177.
Merton was the son of a prominent Columbia University social

scientist, Robert K. Merton, who had studied the behavior of scien-
tists. Shortly after his son was born, Merton p\177re coined the idea of
the \"self-fulfilling prophecy,\" a phenomenon, he suggested, that was
illustrated by depositors who made a run on a bank out offear of a
default--for his son, a prophetic illustration7 The younger Merton,
who grew up in Hastings-on-Hudson, outside New York City,
sho\177ved a knack for devising systematic approaches to whatever he
tackled. Adevoteeof baseball and cars, he studiously memorized first
the batting averages of players and then the engine specs of virtually
every American automobile. \17L7ater, when he played poker, he would
stare at a lightbulb to contract his pupils and throw off opponents.
As if to emulate the scientists his father studied, he was already the
person of whom a later writer would say that he \"lookedfor order
all around him. '''
While he was an undergrad at Cal Tech, another interest, invest-
ing, blossomed. Merton often went to a localbrokerage at 6:30 A.M.,
when the New York markets opened, to spend a fe\177vhours trading
and watching the market. Providentially, he transferred to MIT to
study economics. In the late \17976os, economists were just beginning to
transform finance into a mathematical discipline.Merton, working
under the wing of the famed Paul Samuelson, did nothing less than
invent a new field.Up until then, economists had constructed models
to describe how markets look--or in theory should look--at any
point in time. Merton madea Newtonian leap, modeling prices in a
series of infinitesimally tiny moments. He called this \"continuous
time finance.\" Years later, Stan Jonas, a derivatives specialist with the
French-owned Soci\177td Grin&ale, would observe, \"Most everything
else in finance has been a footnote on what Merton did in the
\17797os.\" His mimeographed blue lecture notesbecameakeepsake.
In the early \17797os, Merton tackled a problem that had been par-
tially solved by two other economists, FischerBlackand Myron S.
Scholes: deriving a formula for the \"correct\" price of a stock option.
Grasping the intimate relation between an option and the underlying
stock, Merton completed the puzzle with an elegantly mathematical
flourish. Then he graciouslywaited to publish until after his peers
did; thus, the formula would ever be known as the Black-
Scholes model. Few people would have cared, given that no active
market for options existed. But coincidentally, a month before the
formula appeared, the Chicago Board Options Exchange had begun

to list stockoptions for trading. Soon, Texas Instruments was adver-
tising in The Wall Street Journal, \"Now you can find the Black-
Scholes value using our.., calculator. .....Thiswas the true beginning
of the derivatives revolution. Never before had professors made such
an impact on Wall Street.
In the t98os, Meriwether and many other traders became accus-
tomedto trading these newfangled instruments just as they did stocks
and bonds. As opposed to actual securities, derivativeswere simply
contracts that derived (hence the name) their value from stocks,
bonds,or other assets. For instance, the value ofa stockoption, the
right to purchase a stockat a specificprice and within a certain time
period,varied with the price of the underlying shares.
Merton jumped at the opportunity to join l.ong-Term Capital be-
cause it seemed a chance to showcase his theories in the real world.
Derivatives,he had recently been arguing, had blurred the lines be-
tween investment firms, banks, and other financial institutions. In the
seamless world of derivatives, a world that Merton had helpedto in-
vent, anyone could assume the risk of loaning money, or of providing
equity, simply by structuring an appropriate contract. It was function
that mattered, not form.This had already been proved in the world
of mortgages, once supplied exclusively by local banks and now
largely funded by countless disparate investors who bought tiny
pieces of securitized mortgagepools.
Indeed, Merton saw Long-Term Capital not asa \"hedge fund,\" a
term that he and the other partners sneered at, but as a state-of-the-
art financial intermediary that provided capital to markets just as
banks did. The bank on the corner borrowed from depositors and
lent to local residents and businesses. It matched its assets--that is,
its loans--with liabilities, attempting to earn a tiny spread by charg-
ing borrowers a slightly higher interest rate than it paid to depositors.
Similarly, Long-TermCapital would \"borrow\" by selling one group
of bonds and lend by purchasing another--presumably bonds that
were slightly less in demand and that therefore yielded slightly higher
interest rates. Thus, the fund would earn a spread, just like a bank.
Though this description is highly simplified, Long-Term, by investing
in the riskier (meaning higher-yielding) bonds, would be in the busi-
ness of \"providing liquidity\" to markets. And what did a bank do but
provide liquidity? Thanks to Merton, the nascent hedge fund began
to think of itself in grander terms.

HEDGE FUND \22531
Unfortunately, Merton was of little use in selling the fund. He was
too serious-minded, and he was busy with classes at Harvard. But in
the summer of I993, J.M. recruited a second academic star: Myron
Scholes.Though regardedas less of a heavyweight by other aca-
demics,Scholes was better known on Wall Street, thanks to the
Black-Scholes formula. Scholes had also worked at Salomon, so he,
too, was close to the Meriwether group. And with tueo of the most
brilliant minds in finance, each said to be on the shortlist of Nobel
candidates, Long-Term had the equivalent of Michael Jordan and
Muhammad All on the same team. \"This was mystique taken to a
very high extreme,\" said a money manager who ultimately invested
in the fund.
In the fall of \177993, Merrill Lynch launched a madcap drive to
recruit investors. Big-ticket clientswere ferried by limousine to Mer-
rill's headquarters, at the lower tip of Manhattan, where they were
shown a presentation on the fund, sworn to secrecy and then re-
turned to their limos.Then, Merrill and various groups of partners
took their show on the road, making stops in Boston, Philadelphia,
Tallahassee, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Madison,
Kansas City, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Amsterdam, London,
Madrid, Paris, Brussels, Zurich, Rome, Silo Paulo, Buenos Aires,
Tokyo, Hong Kong, Abu Dhabi, and Saudi Arabia. Long-Termseta
minimum of $\177o million per investor.
The road showstarted badly.J.M.was statesmanlike but reserved,
as if afraid that anything he said would betray the group's secrets.

Meyergriped. The understated Rosenfeld was too low-key;he struck
one investor as nearly comatose. Greg Hawkins, a former pupil of
Merton, was the worst--full of Greek letters denoting algebraic sym-
bols. The partners didn't know how to tell a story; they sounded like
math professors. Even the fund's name lacked pizzazz; only the
earnest Merton likedit. Investorshad any number of reasons to shy
away. Many were put off by J.M.'s unwillingness to discuss his in-
vestment strategies. Some were frightened by the prospective lever-
age, which J.M. was careful to disclose. Institutions such as the
Rockefeller Foundation and Loews Corporationbalked at paying
such high fees. Long-Term'sentire premiseseemed untested, espe-
cially to the consultants who advise institutions and who decide
where a lot of money gets invested.

Meriwether, who was continually angling to raise Long-Term's
pedigree, went to Omaha for a steak dinner with Buffett, knowing
that if Buffett invested, others would, too. The jovial billionaire was
his usual self--friendly, encouraging,and perfectly unwilling to write
a check.
Rebuffed by the country's richest investor, .I.M.approached Jon
Corzine, who had long envied Meriwether's unit at Salomon and who
was trying to build a rival business at Goldman Sachs. Corzine dan-
gled the prospect of Goldman's becoming a big investor or, perhaps,
of its taking Meriwether's new fund in-house. Ultimately, it did nei-
ther. Union Bank of Switzerland took a long look, but it passed, too.
Not winning these big banks hurt. Despite his bravura, J.M. was
worried about being cut out of the loop at Salomon. He badly
wanted an institutional anchor.
Turning necessity to advantage, J.M. next pursued a handful of
foreign banks to be Long-Term'squasi partners, to give the fund an
international gloss. Each partner--J.M, dubbed them \"strategic
investors\"--would invest $\177oo million and share inside dope about
its local market. In theory, at least, Long-Term would reciprocate.
The plan was pure Meriwether, flattering potential investors by call-
ing them \"strategic.\" Merton loved the idea; it seemed to validate his
theory that the old institutional relationships couldbe overcome. It
opened up a second track, with J.M. independently courting foreign
banks while Merrill worked on recruiting its clients.
Merrill moved the fund-raising forward by devising an ingenious
system of \"feeders\" that enabledLong-Term to solicit funds from in-
vestors in every imaginable tax and legaldomain.One feeder was for
ordinary U.S. investors; another for tax-freepensions; another for
Japanese who wanted their profits hedged in yen; still another for Eu-
ropean institutions, which could invest only in shares that were listed
on an exchange (this feeder got a dummy listing on the Irish Stock
Exchange).
The feedersdidn't keep the money; they were paper conduits that
channeled the money to acentral fund, known as Long-Term Capital
Portfolio (LTCP),a Cayman Islands partnership. For all practical
purposes, Long-Term Capital Portfolio was the fund: it was the en-
tity that would buy and sellbonds and hold the assets. The vehicle
that ran the fund was Long-TermCapital Management (LTCM), a
Delaware partnership owned by J.M., his partners, and someof their

spouses. Though such a complicated organization might have dis-
suaded others, it was welcome to the partners, who viewed their abil-
ity to structure complextradesasone of their advantages over other
traders. Physically, of course, the partners werenowhere near either
the Caymans or Delaware but in offices in Greenwich, Connecticut,
and 1,ondon.
The partners got a break just as they started the marketing. They
were at the office of their lawyer, Thomas Bell, a partner at Simpson
Thacher& Bartlett, when Rosenfeld excitedly jumped up and said,
\"Look at this! Do you see what Salomon did?\" He threw down a
piece of paper--Salomon's earnings statement. The bank had finally
decided to break out the earnings from Arbitrage, so Long-Term
could now point to its partners' priorrecord. Reading between the
lines, it was clear that J.M.'s group had been responsible for most of
Salomon's previous profits--more than $5oo million a year during
his last five years at the firm. However, even this was not enough to
persuade investors. And despite Merrill's pleading, the partners re-
mained far too tight-lipped about their strategies. Long-Term evenre-
fused to give examples of trades, so potential investors had little idea
of what the partners were proposing. Bondarbitrage wasn't widely
understood, after all.
Edson Mitchell, the chain-smoking Merrill executive who oversaw
the fund-raising, was desperate for J.M. to openup; it was as if J.M.
had forgotten that he was the one asking for money. Even in private
sessions with Mitchell, J.M. wouldn't reveal the names of the banks
he was calling; he treated every detail like a state secret. With such a
guarded client, Mitchell couldn't evensell the fund to his own bosses.
Although Mitchell suggested that Merrill becomea strategic partner,
David Komansky, who oversaw capital markets for Merrill, warily
refused. He agreed to invest Merrill's fee, about $\1775 million, but
balked at putting in more.
At one point during the road show, a group including Scholes,
Hawkins, and some Merrill peoplc took a grueling trip to Indi-
anapolis to visit Conseco, a big insurance company.They arrived ex-
hausted. Scholes started to talk about how Long-Term could make
bundles even in relatively efficient markets. Suddenly, Andrew Chow,
a cheeky thirty-year-old derivativestrader, blurted out, \"There aren't
that many opportunities; there isno way you can make that kind of
money in Treasury markets.\"Chow, whose academic credentials con-

sisted of merelya master's in finance, seemed not at all awed by the
famed Black-Scholes inventor. Furious, Scholesangledforward in his
leather-backed chair and said, \"You're the reason--because of fools
like you we can. ''\177The Conseco people got huffy, and the meeting
ended badly. Merrill demanded that Scholes apologize. Hawkins
thought it was hilarious; he was holding his stomach laughing.
But in trnth, Scholes was the fund's best salesman. Investors at
least had heard of Scholes; a couple had even taken his class. And
Scholes wasa natural raconteur, temperamental but extroverted. He
used a vivid metaphor to pitch the fund. Long-Term, he explained,
would be earning a tiny spread on each of thousands of trades, as if
it were vacuuming up nickels that others couldn't see. He would
pluck a nickel seemingly from the sky as he spoke; a little show-
manship never hurt. Even when it came to the fund's often arcane
details, Scholescould glibly waltz through the math, leaving most of
his prospects feeling like humble students. \"They used Myron to
blow yon away,\" said Maxwell Bublitz, head of Conseco's invest-
mellt arm.
\225he son of an Ontario dentist, Scholeswas an unlikely scholar.
Relentlessly entrepreneuriak he and his brother had gotten involved
in a string of business ventures, such as publishing, and selling satin
sheets.'-' After college, in 1962,, the restless Scholes got a summer
job as acomputer programmer at the University of Chicago, despite
knowing next to nothing about computers. Thebusinessschool fac-
ulty had just awakened to the computer's power, and was promot-
ing data-based research, in particular studies based on stock market
prices. Scholes's computer work was so invaluable that the profes-
sors urged him to stick around and take up the study of markets
himself.
'\177
As it happened, Scholes had landed m a cauldron of neoconserva-
rive ferment. Scholars such as Eugene E Fama and Merton H. Miller
were developing what would become the central idea in modern fi-
nance: the Efficient Market Hypothesis. The premise of the hypothe-
sis is that stock prices are always \"right\"; therefore, no one can
divine the market's future direction, which, in turn, must be \"ran-
dom.\" For prices to be right, of course, the people who set them must
be both rational and well informed. In effect, the hypothesis assumes
that every trading floor and brokerage office arotmd the world--
or at least enough of them to determine prices -is s\177affcd by a race

of calm, collected Larry Hilibrands, who never pay more, never pay
less than any security is \"worth.\" According to Victor Niederhoffer,
who studied with Scholes at Chicago and would later blow up an
investment firm of his own, Scholes was part of a \"Random Walk
Cosa Nostra,\" one of the disciples who methodically rejected any
suggestion that markets could err. Swarthy and w\177luble, Scholes once
lectured a realestate agent who urged him to buy in Hyde Park, near
the university, and who claimed that housing prices in the area were
supposed to rise by \17z7 percent a year. If that were true, Scholes shot
back, people would buy all the houses now. Despite his credo,
Scholeswas never fully convinced that he couldn't beat the market.
In the late i96os, he put his salary into stocks and borrowed to
pay his living expenses. When the market plummeted, he had to beg
his banker for an extension to avoid beingforced to sell at a heavy
loss. Eventually, his stocks recovered--not the last timea Long-Term
partner would learn the value ofa friendly banker. '\177
While Merton was the consummate theoretician,Scholes was ac-
claimed for finding ingenious ways of testing theories, fie wasas ar-
gumentative as Merton was reserved, feverishly promoting one
brainstorm after the next, most of which were unlikely to see the light
of day but which often showed a creative spark. With his practical
bent, he made a real contribution to Salomon, where he set up a
derivative-trading subsidiary. And Scholeswasa foremostexpert on
tax codes, both in the United States and overseas.Heregardedtaxes
as a vast intellectual game: \"No one actually pays taxes,\" he once
snapped disdainfully. '\177Scholes could not believe there were people
who would not go to extremesto aw\177id paying taxes, perhaps because
they did not fit the Chicago School model of human beings as eco-
nomic robots. At Long-Term, Scholes was the spearhead of a clever
plan that let the partners defer their cut of the profits for up to ten
years in order to put off paying taxes. He harangued the attorneys
with details, but the partners tended to forgive his hot flashes. They
werecharmed by Scholes's energy and joie de vivre, fie was perpetu-
ally reinventing himself, taking up new sportssuchas skiing and--on
account of Meriwether--golf, which he played with passion.
With Schotes on board, the marketing campaign gradually picked
up steam. The fund dangled a tantalizing plum beforeinvestors, who
were told that annual returns on the order of 30 percent (after the
partners took their fees) would not be out ofreach.Moreover, though

the partners stated clearly that risk was involved, they stressed that
they planned to diversify. With their portfolio spread around the
globe, they felt that their eggs would be safely scattered. Thus, no one
single market could pull the fund down.
The partners doggedly pursued the choicest investors, often invit-
ing prospects backto their pristine headquarters on Steamboat Road,
at the water's edge in Greenwich. Some investors met with parmers
as many as seven or eight times. In their casual khakis and golf shirts,
the parmers looked supremely confident. The fact was, they had
made a ton of money at Salomon, and investorswarmed to the idea
that they could do it again. In the face of such intellectual brilliance,
investors--having little understanding of how Meriwether's gang ac-
tually operated--gradually forgot that they were taking a leap of
faith. \"This was a constellation of people who knew how to make
moneB\" Raymond Baer,a Swiss banker (and eventual investor),
noted. By the end of \177993, commitments for money were starting to
roll in, even though the fund had not yet opened and was well behind
schedule. The partners' morale got a big boost when Hilibrand finally
defected from Salomon and ioinedthem. Merton and Scholes might
have added marketing luster, but Hilibrand was the guy who would
make the cash register sing.
J.M. also offered partnerships to two of his longtime golfing
cronies, Richard E Leahy, an executive at Salomon, and James J.
McEntee, a close friend who had founded a bond-dealing firm. Nei-
ther fit the mold of Long-Term's nerdy traders. Leahy, an affable,
easygoing salesman, would be expected to deal with Wall Street
bankers--not the headstrong traders' strong suit. McEntee's role,
though, was a puzzle. After selling his business, he had lived in high
style, commuting via helicopter to a home in the Hamptons and iet-
ring to an island in the Grenadines, which had earned him the sobri-
quet \"the Sheik.\" In contrast to the egghead arbitragcurs, the
Bronx-born McEntee was a traditionalist who traded from his gut.
But Meriwether liked having such friends around; ba\177tcring with
these pals, he was relaxed and even gregarious. Not comcidentally,
Leahy and McEnteewere fellow Irish Americans, a group with whom
J.M. always felt at home. Each was also a parmcr in the asset that
was closest to J.M.'s heart--a remote, exquisitely manicured golf
course, on the coast of southwestern [relnnd, known as Waterville.
Early in 1994, J.M. bagged the most astonishing name of all:

David W. Mullins, vice chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserveand scc
ond in the Fed's hierarchy to Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairmal\177.
Mullins, too, was a former student of Merton's at M1T who had gone
onto teach at Harvard, where he and Rosenfeldhad been friends. As
a central banker, he gaveLong-Term incomparable access to interna-
tional banks. Moreover, Mullins had been the Fed's point man on the
Mozer case. The implication was that Meriwether now had a clean
bill of health from Washington.
Mullins, like Meriwether a onetime teenage i\177vestor, was the son
ofa University of Arkansas president and an enormously popularlec-
turer at Harvard. Ironically, he had launched his career in govern-
ment as an expert on financial crises; he was expected to be
Long-Term's disaster guru if markets came unstuck again. After the
t987 stock market crash, Mullins had helped write a blue-ribbon
White House report, laying substantial blame on the new derivatives
markets, where the snowball selling had gathered momentum. Then
he had joined the Treasury, where hehad helped draft the law to bail
out the country's bankrupt savings and loans. As a regulator, he was
acutely aware that markets--far from being perfect pricing
chines--periodically and dangerously overshoot. \"Our financial sys-
tem is fast-paced, enormously creative.It'sdesignedto have near
misses with some frequency,\" he remarked a year before jumping ship
for 1.ong-Term. With more omniscience regarding his future fund
than he could have dreamed, Mullins argued that part of the Fed's
mission should be saving private institutions that were threatened by
\"liquidity problems.\" \177
Wry and soft-spoken, the intellectual Mullins dressed like a banker
and was thought to be a potential successorto Greenspan. Nicholas
Brady, his former boss at Treasury, wondered when Mullins joined
Long-Term what he was doing with \"those guys.\" Investors, though,
were soothed by the addition of the congenial Mullins, whose per-
spective on markets may have been much like their own. Indeed, by
snaring acentral banker, 1.ong-Term gained unparalleled access for a
private fund to the pots of money in qt\177asi-gover1\177mental accounts
around the world. Soon, l\177ong-Term won commitments from the
HongKongLand& Development Authority, the Government of Sin-
gapore Investment Corporation, the Bank of Taiwan, the Bank of
Bangkok, and the Kuwaiti state-run pension fund. In a rare coup,
Long-Term even enticed the foreign exchange officeof Italy's central

bank to invest $\177oo million. Such entities simply do not invest in
hedge funds. But Pierantonio Ciampicali, who oversaw investments
for the Italian agency, thought of Long-Term not as a \"hedge fund\"
but as an elite investing organization \"with a solid reputation.\" ':
Private investors were similarly awed by a fund boasting the best
minds in finance and a residentcentral banker, who plausibly would
beastep ahead in the obsessive Wall Streetgameof trying to outguess
Greenspan. The list was impressive. In Japan, Long-Termsigned up
Sumitomo Bank for $xoo million. In Europe, it corralled the giant
German Dresdner Bank, the Liechtenstein Global Trust, and Bank
Julius Baer, a private Swiss bank that pitched the fund to its million-
aireclientele, for sums ranging from $3o million to $\177oomillion. Re-
public New York Corporation, a secretive organization run by
international banker Edmond Safra,was mesmerized by Long-Term's
credentials and seduced by the possibility of winning business from
the fund. '\177It invested $65 million. Long-Termalsosnared Banco
Garantia, Brazil's biggest investment bank.
In the United States, Long-Term got money from a diverse group
of hotshot celebrities and institutions. Michael Ovitz, the Hollywood
agent, invested; so did Phil Knight, chief executive of Nike, the
sneaker giant, as well aspartners at the elite consulting firm McKin-
sey & Company and New York oil executive Robert Belfer..]ames
Cayne,the chief executive of Bear Stearns, figured that Long-Term
would make so much money that its fees wouldn't matter. Likeoth-
ers, Cayne was comforted by the willingness of J.M. and his partners
to invest $146 million of their own. (Rosenfeld and others put their
kids' money in, too.) Academe, where the professors' brilliance was
well known, was an easy sell:St.John's University and Yeshiva Uni-
versity put in $1 o million each; the University of Pittsburgh climbed
aboard for half that. In Shaker Heights, Paragon Advisors put its
wealthy clients into Long-Term. Terence Sullivan, president of
Paragon, had read Merton and Scholes while getting a business de-
gree;he felt the operation was low risk. '\177
In the corporate world, PaineWebber, thinking it would tap Long-
Termfor investing ideas, invested $\177oo million; Donald Matron, its
chairman,added $\177o million personally. Others included the Black&
Decker Corporation pension fund, Continental Insurance of New
York (later acquired by Loews), and Presidential1,ire(7orporation.

HE GOI)S SMILED on Long-Term. Having raisedcapital during the
best of times, it put its money to work just as clouds began to
gather over Wall Street. Investors long for steady waters, but para-
doxically, the opportunities are richest when markets turn turbulent.
When pricesare flat, trading is a dull sport. When pricesbeginto gy-
rate, it is as if little eddies and currents begin to bubble in a formerly
placid river. This security is dragged with the current, that one is
washed upstream.Twobonds that once journeyed happily in tow are
now wrenched apart, and once predictable spreads are jolted out of
sync. Suddenly, investors feel cast adrift. Those who arc weak or in-
secure may panic or at any rate sell. If enough do so, a dangerous un-
dertow may distort the entire market. For the few who have hung on
to their capital and their wits, this is when opportunity beckons.
In 1994, as Meriwether was wrapping up the fund-raising,
Greenspan started to worry that the U.S. economy might be over-
heating. Mullins, who was cleaning out his desk at the Fed and
preparing to jump to Long-Term, nrged the Fed chief to tighten
credit. \17I7n February, just when interest rates were at their lowest--

Greenspan stunned Wall Street by raising short-term interest rates. It
was the first such hike in five years. But if the oracular Fed chief had
in mind calming markets, the move backfired. Bond prices tumbled
(bond prices, of course, move in the opposite direction of interest
rates). And given the modest nature of Greenspan's quarter-point in-
crease,bonds were falling more than they \"should\" have. Somebody
wasdesperate
to sell.
By May, barely two months after Long-Term'sdebut, the thirty-
year Treasury bond had plunged x6 percent from its recent peak--a
huge move in the relatively tame world of fixed-incomesecurities--
rising m yield from 6.z percentto 7.6percent.Bonds in Europe were
crashing, too. Diverse investors, including hedge funds--many of
which were up to their necks in debt--were fleeing from bonds.
MichaelSteinhardt, one such leveraged operator, watched in horror.
Steinhardt, who had bet on European bonds, was losing $7 million
with every hundredth of a percentage point move in interest rates.
The swashbuckling Steinhardt lost $8oo million of his investors'
money in a mere four days.GeorgeSoros, who was jolted by a rico-
cheteffect on international currencies, dropped $65o million for his
clients in two days.-'
For Meriwether, this tumult was the best of news.One morning
during the heat of the selling, J.M. walked over to oneof his traders.
Glancing at the trader's screen,J.M. marveled, \"It's wave after wave
of guys throwing in the towel.\" As J.M. knew, panicky investors
wouldn't be picky as they ran for the exits. In their eagerness to sell,
they were pushing spreads wider, creating just the gaps that Meri-
wether was hoping to exploit. \"The unusually high w\177latility in the
bond markets.., has generally been associated with a widening of
spreads,\" he chirped in a--for him--unusually revealing letter to in-
vestors. \"This widening has created further opportunities to add to
LTCP's convergence and relative-value trading positions. ''\177After two
flat months, Long-Termrose7 percent in May, beginning a stretch of
heady profits. It would hardly have occurred to Mcriwether that
Long-Term would ever switch places with some of those panicked,
overleveragedhedge funds. But the bond debacle of 1994, which un-
folded during Long-Term's very first months, merited Long-Term's
closeattention.
Commentators began to see a new connectedness in international
bond markets. The Wall Street Journal observed that \"implosions in

seemingly unrelated marketswere reverberating in the U.S. Treasury
bond market. ''\177Such disparate developments as a slide in European
bonds, news of trading losses at Bankers Trust, the collapse of Askin
Capital Management, a hedge fund that had specialized in mortgage
trades, and the assassination of Mexico's leading presidential con-
tender all accentuated the slide in U.S. Treasurys that had begun with
Greenspan's modest
adjustment.
Suddenly markets were more closelylinked--a development with
pivotal significance for Long-Term. It meant that a trend in one mar-
ket could spread to the next. An isolated slump could become a gen-
eralized rout. With derivatives, which could be custom-tailored to
any market of one's fancy, it was a snap for aspeculator in New York
to take a flier on Japan or for one in Amsterdam to gamble on
Brazil--raising the prospect that trouble on one front would leach
into the next. For traders tethered to electronic screens, the distinc-
tion between markets--say, between mortgages in America and gov-
ernment loans in France--almost ceased to exist. They were all points
on a continuum of risk, stitched together by derivatives. With traders
scrambling to pay back debts, Neal Soss, an economist at Credit
Suisse First Boston, explained to the Journal, \"You don't sell what
you should. You sell what you can.\" By leveraging one security, ill-
vestors had potentially given up control of all of their others. This
verity is well worth remembering: the securities might be unrelated,
but the sameinvestorsowned them, implicitly linking them in times
of stress. And when armies of financial soldiers were involved in the
same securities, borders shrank. The very concept of safety through
diversification--the basis of Long-Term's own security--would merit
rethinking.
Steinhardt blamed his losses on a sudden evaporation of \"'liquid-
ity,\" a term that would be on Long-Tcrm's lips in years to come. \17B7ut
\"liquidity\" is a straw man. Whenever markets phmge, investors are
stunned to find that there are not enough buyers to go around. As
Keynes observed, there cannot be \"liquidity\" for the community as a
whole.\" The mistake is in thinking that markets have a duty to stay
liquid or that buyers will always be present to accommodatesell-
ers. The real culprit in 1994 was leverage. If you aren't in debt, you
can't go broke and can't be made to sell, in which case \"liquidity\" is
irrelevant. But a leveraged firm may be fi\177rced to sell, lest fast-
accumulating losses put it out ofbusiness, l\177evcragc always gives rise

to this same brutal dynamic, and its dangers cannot bestressed too
often.
Long-Term \177vas doubly fortunate: spreads \177videned before it in-
vested much of its capital, and once opportunities did arise, Long-
Term \177vasone of a very fe\177vfirms in a position to exploit the general
distress. And its trades \177vere good trades. They \177veren't risk-free; they
\177veren't so good that the fund could leverage indiscriminately. But by
and large, they \177vere intelligent and opportunistic. Long-Term started
to make money on them almost immediately.
Oneof its first trades involved the same thirty-year Treasury bond.
Treasurys (of all durations) are, ofcourse, issued by the U.S. govern-
ment to finance the federalbudget.Some $\1777o billion of them trade
each day, and they are considered the least risky investments in the
\177vorld. But a funny thing happensto thirty-year Treasurys six months
or soafter they are issued: investors stuff them into safes and dra\177v-
ers for long-term keeping. With fe\177ver left in circulation, the bonds
become harder to trade. Mean\177vhile, the Treasury issuesa ne\177v thirty-
year bond, \177vhich no\177v has its day in the sun. On Wall Street, the
older bond, \177vhich has about 2.9'/2 years left to mature, is kno\177vn as
off the run; the shiny ne\177v model is on the run. Being less liquid, the
off-the-run bond is considered less desirable. It begins to trade at a
slight discount (that is, you canpurchase it for a little less, or at \177vhat
amounts to a slightly higher interest yield). As arbitrageurs \177vould
say, a spread opens.
In 1994, l,ong-Term noticed that this spread \177vas unusually \177vide.
The February I993 issue \177vastrading at a yield of 7.36 percent. The
bond issued six months later, in August, \177vasyielding only 7.z4 per-
cent, or tz basis points, less. Every Tuesday, Long-Term's partners
held a risk-management meeting, and at one of the early meetings,
several proposed that they bet on this \177z-point gap to narro\177v. It
\177vasn't enough to say, \"Onebondis cheaper, one bond is dearer.\" The
professorsneeded to kno\177v why a spread existed, which might shed
light on the paramount issue of \177vhcther it \177vas likely to persist or
evento \177viden. In this case, the spread seemed almost silly. After all,
the U.S. government is no less likely to pay off a bond that matures
in \1779'/\"years than it isone that expires in thirty. But some institutions
\177vere so timid, so bureaucratic, that they refused to o\177vn anything but
the most liquid paper. Long-Term believed that many opportunities
arose from market distortions created by the sometimes arbitrary de-

mands of institutions. 7The latter were willing to pay a premium for
on-the-run paper,and Long-Term' ps artners, who had often done this
trade at Salomon, happily collectedit.Theycalled it a \"snap trade,\"
because the two bonds usually snapped together after only a few
months. In effect, Long-Term would be collecting a fee for its will-
ingness to own a less liquid bond.
\"A lot of our trades were liquidity-providing,\" Rosenfeld noted.
\"We were buying the stuff that everyone wanted to sell.\" It appar-
ently did not occur to Rosenfeld that since l.ong-Term tended to buy
the less liquid security in every market, its assets werenot entirely in-
dependent of one another, the way one dice roll isindependent of the
next. Indeed, its assets would be susceptible to falling in unison if a
time came when, literally, \"everyone\" wanted to sell.
\225
Twelve basis points isa tiny spread; ordinarily, it wouldn't be worth
the trouble. The price differencewas only $x5.8o for each pair of
$t,ooobonds. Even if the spread narrowed two thirds of the way, say
in a few months' time, Long-Term would earn only $\1o77, or \177percent,
on those $t,ooo bonds. But what if, using leverage, that tiny spread
could be multiplied? What if, indeed! With such a strategy in mind,
Long-Term bought $\177 billion of the cheaper, off-the-run bonds. It
also sold $ \177billion of the more expensive, on-the-run Treasurys. This
was a staggering sum. Right off the bat, the partners were risking all
of Long-Term's capital! To besure, they weren't likely to lose very
much of it. Since they were buying one bond and selling another, they
were betting only that the bonds would converge, and, as noted,
bond spreads vary much less than bonds themselvesdo. The price of
your home could crash, but if it does, the priceof your neighbor's
house will likely crash as well. Of course, there was some risk that
the spread could widen, at least for a brief period. If two bonds
traded at a \17z7-point spread, who c(mld say that the spread wouldn't
go to \1774points--or, in a time of extreme stress, to zo points?
Long-Term, with trademark precision,calculated that owning one
bond and shorting another was one twenty-fifth as risky as owning
either bond outright. \17T7hus, it reckoned that it could prudently lever-
age this long/short arbitrage twenty-five times. This multiplied its po-
tential for profit but--as we have seen--also its potential for loss. In
any case, borrow it did. It paid for the cheaper, off-tht'-rtm bonds

with money that it borrowed froln a Wall Street bank, or from sev-
eral banks. And the other bonds, the ones it sold short, it obtained
through a loan, as well.
Actually, the transaction was more involved, though it was among
the simplest in I.ong-Term's repertoire. No sooner did Long-Term
buy the off-the-run bonds than it loaned them to some other Wall
Street firm, which then wired cash to Long-Termascollateral. Then
Long-Term turned around and used this cash as collateral on the
bonds that it borrowed. On Wall Street, such short-term, collateral-
ized loans are known as \"repo financing.\"
The beauty of the trade was that Long-Term's cash transactions
were in perfect balance. The money that Long-Term spent going long
(buying) matched the money it collected going short (selling). The
collateral it paid equaled the collateral it collected. In other words,
Long-Termpulledoff the entire $z billion trade without using a dime
of its own cash. *
Now, normally, when you borrow a bond from, say, Merrill
Lynch, you have to posta little bit of extra collateral--maybe a total
of $i,oio on a $i,ooo Treasury and more on a riskier bond. That
$\177o initial margin, equivalent to i percent of the bond's value, is
calleda haircut. It's Merrill Lynch's way of protecting itself in case
the price of the bond rises.
The haircut naturally acts as a check on how much you can trade.
But if you could avoid the haircut, well, the sky would be the limit.
It would be like driving a car that didn't burn gas: you could drive as
far as you wished. What's more, the rate of return would besubstan-
tially higher--if you didn't have that extra margin tied up at Merrill
Lynch.
And from the very start, it was Long-Term's policy to refuseto pay
the haircut or else to substantially rednce it. The policy surely flowed
from Meriwether, who, for all his nnassummg charm, was fiercely
competitive at trading, golf, billiards, horses, and whatcw\177r else he
* Maintaining the position wasn't completely cost tree. Though a simple
trade, it actually entailed h\177urdifferent payment streams. Long-Termcollected
interest on the collateral it paid out and paid interest (at a slightly higher rate)
on the collateral it took in. It made someof this deficit back because it collected
the 7.36 percent coupon on the bond it owned and paid the lesser7.z4 percent
rate on the bond it shorted. Overall, it cost lxmg-Term a few basis points a
month.

touched. Rosenfeld and Leahy, two of the more congenial and laid-
back partners, were usually the ones who met with banks, though
Hilibrand also got involved. In any case, the partners would insist,
politely but firmly, that the fund was sowellheeled that it didn't need
to post an initial margin--and, what's more, that it wouldn't trade
with anyone that saw matters differently. Merrill Lynch agreed to
waive its usual haircut requirement and go along. Sodid Goldman
Sachs, J. P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, and just about everyone else.
One firm that balked, PaineWebber, got virtually none of Long-
Term's business. \"You had no choice if you were going to do business
with them,\" recalled Goldman Sachs's Jon Corzine,J.M.'s admiring
rival.
Although Long-Term's trades could be insanely complex and ulti-
mately numbered in the thousands, the fund had no more than a
dozenorso major strategies.\" Some, such as the Treasury arbitrage,
involved buying and selling tangible securities. The others, derivative
trades, did not. They were simply bets that Long-Termmade with
banks and other counterparties that hinged on the fate of various
market prices.
hnagine, by illustration, that a Red Sox fan and a Yankees fan
agree before the season that each will pay the other $\177,ooo for every
run scored by his rival's team. Long-Term's derivative contracts were
not dissimilar, except that the payoffs were tied to movements in
bonds, stocks, and so forth rather than balls and strikes. Thesede-
rivative obligations did not appear on Long-Term'sbalancesheet, nor
were they \"debt\" in the formal sense. But if markets moved against
the fund, the result would obviously be the same. And Long-Term
generally wasable to forgo paying initial margin on derivativedeals;
it made these bets without putting up any initial capital whatsoever.
Frequently, though not always, it got the sameterms on repo fi-
nancing of actual securities. Also,Long-Term often persuaded banks
to lend to it for longer periods than the banks gave to other funds.'\"
Thus, Long-Term could be more patient. Even if the banks had
wanted to call in Long-Term's loans, they couldn't have done so very
quickly. \"They had everyone overa barrel,\" noted a senior executive
at atop investment bank.
This was where Meriwether's marketing strategy really paid divi-
dends. If the banks had given it a moment's thought, they would have
,\242alizcd that l.o\177Tg ]\177'r\177nwas at their mercy. But the b;mks saw the

fund not as a credit-hungry start-up but as a luminous firm of cclc
brated scholars and brilliant traders, something like that New Age
\"financial intermediary\" conjured up by Merton. After all, it was
generally believed that Long-Term had the benefit of superior, virtu-
ally fail-safe technology. And banks, like someof the press, casually
assumed that it was so. Business Week gushed that the fund's Ph.D.s
would give riseto \"a new computer age\" on Wall Street. \"Never has
this much academic talent been given this much moneyto bet with,\"
the magazine observed in a cover story published during the fund's
first year.\" If a new age was coming, noone wanted to miss it. Long-
Termwasas fetching as a debutante on prom night, and all the banks
wanted to dance.
The banks had no trouble rationalizing their easy credit terms. The
banks did hold collateral, after all, and Long-Termgenerally settled
up (in cash) at the end ofeach trading day, collecting on winners and
paying on losers. And Long-Term was flush, so the risk of its failing
seemed slight. Only if Long-Term lost money with unthinkable
suddenness--only if, say, it was forced to dump the majority of its as-
setsall at once and into an illiquid market--would the value of the
bankers' collateral be threatened and would the banks themselves be
exposedto losses.
Also, many of the banks' heads, such as Corzine and Merrill
Lynch's Tully, liked Meriwether personally, which tilted their organi-
zations in Long-Term's favor. But Long-Term's real sellingpoint was
its connections to other powerful traders around the world. A firm
that did business with Long-Term might gain valuable inside knowl-
edge-totally legal in the bond world--about the flow of markets.
\"How do you get people to come to your party? You tell them that
every cool person in town is coming,\" said a banker in Zurich who
financed Long-Term with a zero percent haircut. \"Soeveryonesaid,
'OK,I'lldo it, but if anyone else getsa haircut, I get one tot).'\" This
was especiallyclever of Long-Term. The partners could say to each
new bank, \"If we give you a haircut, we have to give it to everyone.\"
So they ended up giving it to nobody. (On a small number of riskier
trades they did agree to haircuts--but very skimpy ones.)
Since the banks, too, were doing arbitrage trading, Meriwether
viewed them, not unjustly, as his main competitors.',-' Long-Termre-
sembled other hedge funds such as Soros's Quantum Fund less than
it did the proprietary desks of its banks, suchas Goldman Sachs. The

Street was slowly shifting from research and client servicesto the lu-
crative business of trading for its own account, fostering a wary ri-
valry between Long-Term and its lenders.
Having worked at a major Wall Street bank, J.M. felt that invest-
ment banks were rife with leaks and couldn't be trusted not to swipe
his trades for themselves.Indeed, most of them were plying similar
strategies.Thus,as a precaution, Long-Term would place orders for
eachleg of a trade with a different broker.Morganwould seeoneleg,
Merrill I,ynch another, and Goldman yet another, but nobody would
see them all. Even Long-Term's lawyer was kept in the dark; he
would hear the partners speak about \"trading strategy three,\" as
though Long-Term weredevelopinganuclear arsenal.
Hilibrand, especially, refused to give the banks apeekat hisstrate-
giesor to meet them halfway on terms. He would call a dealer, pur-
chase$1oo million in bonds, and be off the phone in seconds. '\177\"I'm
just concerned about margin requirement, and I'm not putting up any
margin,\" he bluntly told Merrill Lynch. Kevin Dunleavy, a Merrill
Lynch salesman, sometimescalled Hilibrand two or three times a day,
trying to pitch strategies he had devised with the clever Hilibrand in
mind. But Dunleavy was repeatedly frustrated by Hilibrand's obses-
sive secrecy, which made it nearly impossible to servicethe account.
\"Rarely could you take your ideasand implement them into LTCM's
strategy,\" noted Dunleavy, an unaffected New Yorker with a military
brush cut. \"It was very unusual, not to take input from the Street.
Larry would never talk about the strategy. He would just tell you
what he wanted to do.\"
The fund parceled out its business, choosingeach bank for partic-
ular services and keepinga distance from all of them. Chary of be-
coming dependent on any one bank, Long-Termtraded junk bonds
with Goldman Sachs, government bonds and yen swaps with J. P.
Morgan, mortgages with Lehman Brothers. Merrill Lynch was the
fund's biggest counterparty in derivatives, but it was far down the list
m repo loans. To besure, there was something shrewd about this
divide-and-conquer strategy, for Long-Term did each set of trades
with the bank that boasted the most specific expertise. But Long-Term
thus forfeited the benefits of a closer,ongoingrelationship.J. P. Mor-
gan, for one, was extremely curious about Long-Term and eagertode-
velop a closer working alliance, but it couldn't get past the fund's
unwillingness to share confidences. \"How can you propose ideas to

thetn without knowing what their appetite is?\" wondered the head
of risk management at a major Wall Street firm. As arbitrageurs,
the partners tended to see every encounter as a discrete exchange,
with tallyable pluses and minuses. Every relationship was a \"trade\"--
renegotiableor revocable if someone else had a better price.The part-
ners' only close ties were within l.ong-Term, mimicking the arrange-
ment within their beloved group at Salomon.
They were a bred type--intellectual, introverted, detached, con-
trolled. It didn't work to try to play one off against the other; they
were too much on the same wavelength. Andrew Sicilian(), who ran
the bond and currency departments at Swiss Bank Corporation, was
stunned by their uncanny closeness. One time, Siciliano called Victor
Haghani, the head of the London office, and followed up in Green-
wich with J.M. and Eric Rosenfeld a month or two later. The
American-based partners didn't miss a beat; Siciliano had the eerie
feeling that he was continuing the same conversation he'd had with
Haghani.
Not that there weren't tensions within the firm. A small group--
J.M.,Hilibrand, Rosenfeld, and Haghani--dominated the rest. As at
Salomon, compensation was skewed toward the top, with the inner
circle garnering lnore than half the rewards. This group also had vot-
ing control. Lesserpartners such as Myron Scholes were forever an-
gling for more money, as well asmore authority. But the inner circle
had been together for years; as in a family, their exclusive and inbred
alliance had became second nature.
If the firm could have beendistilled into a single person, it would
have beenHilibrand. While veteran traders tend to becynicaland in-
secure, the result of years of wrong guesses and narrow escapes, Hill-
brand was cool and maddeningly self-confident. An incredibly hard
worker, he was the pure arbitrageur; he believed in the models, stuck
to his prices, was untroubled by doubt. Roscl\177fcld hated to hedge by
selling a falling asset, as theory prescribed; ttilibrand believed and
simply followed the form. Hilibrand's colleaguesrespected him im-
mensely; inevitably, they turned to him when they needed a quick
read. Hewas highly articulate, but his answers were like unrefined
crystals, difficult for novicesto comprehend. \"You could refract the
light with Larry's mind,\" said Deryck Maughan of SalomonBrothers.
Like the other partners, but to a greater degree, Hilibrand saw every
issue in black and white. He was trustworthy and quick to take of-

fense at perceived wrongdoing but blind to concerns outside his nar-
row sphere. His Salomoncolleaguesused to ioke that, according to
the libertarian Hilibrand, if the street in front of your home had a
pothole you ought to pave it yourself. But money probably meant less
to him than to any of them. He found his passion in the intellectual
challenge of trading. Aside from his family, he showed interest in lit-
fie else. If anyone brought Hilibrand out of himself a bit, it was J.M.
Hilibrand had a filial attachment to the chief,perhaps stemming from
his close relationship to his own father. Rosenfeld had a similar de-
votion to Meriwether.
Outsiders couldn't quite explain J.M.'s hold on the group. He was
an unlikely star, too bashful for the limelight. He spoke in fragments
and seemed uncomfortable making eyecontact.\"He refused to talk
about his personal life,evento close friends. After organizing Long-
Term, J.M. and his wife moved out of Manhattan, to a $2.7 million,
sixty-eight-acre estate in North Salem, in Westchester County--com-
plete with a x5,ooo-square-foot heated indoor riding ring for Mimi. '\177
The estate was set back three quarters of a mile on a private drive
that the Meriwethers shared with their only neighbor, the entertainer
David Letterman. As if to make the property evenmore private, the
Meriwethers did extensive remodeling, fortifying the house with
stone. J.M. liked to control his private life, as if to shelter it, too, from
unwanted volatility.
Though he attended a church near home and made several visits to
Catholic shrines, J.M. didn't speak about his faith, either. His self-
control was implacable. Nor did he open up among his traders. At
firm meetings he was mostly quiet. He welcomed frank debates
among the partners, but he usually chimed in only at the very end or
not at all.
The firm's headquarters were the ground floor of a glassy four-
story office complex, on a street that ran from the showlined center
of affluent Greenwich past a parade of Victorian homes on Long Is-
land Sound.Several dozen of Long-Term's growing cadre of traders
and strategists worked on the trading floor, where partners and non-
partners sat elbow to elbow, cramped around a sleek, semicircular
deskloaded with computers and market screens. The office had an
elaborate kitchen that had been put in by a previous tenant, but the
partners lunched at their desks. Food meant little to them.
J.M., Merton, and Scholes (the latter two because they didn't

trade) had private offices, but J.M. was usually on the trading floor,
a mahogany-paneled room that looked out through a full-length pic-
ture window to the water, resplendent and often speckled with sail-
boats. Aside from the natty Mullins, the partners dressedcasually, in
Top-Siders and chinos. The room hummed with trader talk, but it
was a controlled hum, not like the chaos on the cavernous New York
trading floors. Onlyoccasionallydid the partners revert to their past
life for a few rounds of liar'spoker.
Besides the Tuesday risk meetings, which were for partners only,
Long-Termhad research seminars on Wednesday mornings that were
open to associates and usually another meeting on Thursday after-
noons, when partners would focus on a specifictrade. Merton, usu-
ally in Cambridge, would join in by telephone. The sharedclose
quarters fostered a firm togetherness, but the associates and even
someof the partners knew they could neverbe part of the inner cir-
cle. One junior trader perpetually worried that his trades would be
found out by the press, which he fearedcouldcost him his job. As-
sociates in Greenwich, even senior traders, werekept so much in the
dark that some resorted to calling their London counterparts to find
out what the firm was buying and selling. Associates were never in-
vited back to the partners' homes--thereseemed to be an unwritten
rule against partners and staff fraternizing. Leahy, a college hockey
player, exchanged the normal office banter with the employees, but
most ofthe partners treated the staff with cool formality. They were
polite but ilaterested only in one another and their work. The analysts
and legal and accounting staffs were second-class citizens, shunted to
a room in the back, where the pool tablewas.
Like everyone else on Wall Street, Long-Term'semployees made
good money. The top staffers conld make $f million to $z million a
year. There was subtle pressnre on the staff to invest their bonuses in
the fund, but most of them were e\177g('r to do so anyway--ironically,
it was considered a major perk of working at l,ong-Term. And so, the
staff confidently reinvested most of their pay.
\225
Just as predicted, Long-Term's o\177l-the-run and off-the-run bonds
snapped back quickly. Long-Term made a magical $\1775 million--
magical because it hadn't used any capital. As Scholes had promised,
Long-Term had scooped up a nickel and, with leverage, turned it into

more. True, many other firms had done the same kind of trade. \"But
we could finance better,\" an employee of Long-Term noted. \"LTCM
was really a financing house.\"
I.ong-Term preferredto reapasure nickel than to gamble on mak-
ing an uncertain dollar, because it could leverage its tiny margins like
a high-volume grocer, sucking up nickel after nickel and multiplying
the process thousands of times.Ofcourse, not even a nickel bet was
absolutely sure. And as Steinhardt, the fund manager, had recently
been reminded, the penalty for being wrong is infinitely greater when
you are leveraged. But in t994, Long-Term was almost neverwrong.
In fact, nearly every trade it touched turned to gold.
Long-Termdubbed its safest bets convergence trades, because the
instruments matured at a specific date, meaning that convergence ap-
peared to beasure thing. Others were known as relativevaluetrades,
in which convergence was expected but not guaranteed.'\"
The bond market turmoil of 1994 seeded the ground for a huge rel-
ative value trade in home mortgage securities. Mortgage securitiesare
pieces of paper backed by the cash flow on pools of mortgages. They
sound boring, but they aren't. Some $\177trillion of mortgage securities
is outstanding at any given time. What makes them exciting is that
clever investment bankers have separated the payments made by
homeowners into two distinct pools: one for interest payments, the
other for principal payments. If you think about it--and I,ong-Term
did, quite a bit--the value of each pool (relative to the other) varies
accordingto the rate at which homeowners pay off their loans ahead
of schedule. If you refinance your mortgage, you pay it off in one
lump sum--that is, in one giant payment of principal. Therefore, no
further cash goes to the interest-only pool. But if you stand pat and
keep writing those monthly checks, you keep making interest pay-
ments for up to thirty years. Therefore, if more people refinance, the
interest-only securities, known as \"lOs,\" will fall; if fewer people pre-
pay, they will rise. The converseis true for principal-only securities,
or POs. And since the rate of refinancings can change quickly, betting
on los orPOs can make or lose you agood deal of money.
In \177993, when Long-Term was raising capital, America was expe-
riencing a surge of refinancings. With mortgage rates dropping below
7percent for the first time since the Vietnam War, baby boomers who

had never given their mortgages a second thought were suddenly
delirious with the prospect of cutting their payments by hundreds of
dollars a month. Getting the lowest rate became a point of pride;
roughly two in five Americans refinanced in that one year--in fact,
somefolks did it twice. Naturally, the prices oflOs plummeted. Ac-
tually, they fell too much. Unless you assumed that the entire country
was going to refinance tomorrow, the price of IOs was simply too
low. Indeed, Meriwether, Hilibrand, Rosenfeld, Haghani, and
Hawkins bought buckets of lOs for their personal accounts.
In i994, as Long-Termwas beginning to trade, lOs remained
cheap for fear there would be another wave of refinancings. Bill
Krasker had designed a model to predict prepayments, and
Hawkins--an outgoing, curly-haired mortgage trader xvith back-
woods charm---continually checked the model against the record of
actual prepayments. The IO price seemed so out of whack that
Hawkins wondered, \"Is there something wrong with the model, or is
this just a good opportunity?\" The methodical Krasker carefully re-
tooled the model, and it all but screamed, \"Buy!\" So Long-Term--
once again with massive leverage--started buying lOs by the
truckload. It acquired a huge stake, estimated at Sz billion worth.
Now, when interest rates rise,people aren't even going to think
about refinancing. But when rates fall, they run to the mortgage bro-
ken That means that lOs rise and fall in sync with interest rates--so
betting on lOs is like betting on interest rates. But the partners didn't
want to forecast rates; such outright speculation made them jittery,
even though they did it on occasion. Because interest rates depend on
so many variables, they are essentially unpredictable. The partners'
forte was making highly specific relative bets that did not depend on
broad
unknowns.
In short, the partners merely felt that, givcn the present levelof in-
terest rates, lOs were cheap. So the partners shrcwdly hedged their
bet by purchasing Treasurys, the prices of which move in the oppo-
sitedirection from interest rates. Thc net effectwas to remove any el-
ement of rate forecasting. The partners excelled at identifying
particular mispriced risks and hedging out all of the other risks. If
Haifa oranges were cheap relative to Fuji apples, they would find a
series oftrades to isolate that particular arbitrage; they didn't simply
buy every orange and sell every apple.
In the spring, when interest rates soared, Long-Term's lOs also

soared, although its Treasury bonds, of course, fell. Thus, it was
ahead on one legof its trade and behind on the other. Then, in I995,
when interest rates receded, Long-Term's Treasurysrose in price. But
this time people did not rush to refinance, so Long-Term's los held
on to much of their former gains. Presumably, people who had got-
ten new mortgages in t993 were not so eager to do it again, l\177ong-
Term made several hundred million dollars. It was off to a sizzling
sta
ft.
Despite appearances, finding these \"nickels\" was anything but
easy.Long-Termwassearchingforpairs of trades--or often, multiple
pairs--that were \"balanced\" enough to be safe but unbalanced in
one or two very particular aspects, so asto offerapotential for profit.
Put differently, in any given strategy, Long-Term typically wanted ex-
posure to one or two risk factors--but no more. In a common
example--yield-curve trades--interest rates in a given country might
be oddly out of line for a certain duration of debt. For instance,
medium-term rates might be far higher than short-term rates and al-
mostas high as long-term rates. Long-Term would concoct a series of
arbitrages betting on this bulge to disappear.
Thebestplace to look for such complex trades was in interna-
tional bond markets. Markets in Europe, as well as in the Third
World, were less efficient than America's; they had yet to be picked
clean by computer-wielding arbitrageurs (or professors). For Long-
Term, these underexploited markets were a happy hunting ground
with a welter ofopportunities. In I994, when the trouble in the U.S.
bond market rippled across the Atlantic, the spreads between Ger-
man, French, and British government debt and, respectively t, he fu-
tures on each country's bonds, widened to nonsensical levels.
Long-Term plunged in and made a fast profit.' It also sallied into
Latin America, where spreads had widenedaswell. '\177The positions
were small, but Long-Term was pursuing every angle--you don't find
nickels lying on the street.Then, Eric Rosenfeld found a few \"coins\"
in Japan, arbitraging warrants on Japanese stocks against options on
the Tokyo index--one of Long-Term's first excursions into equities.
By the mid-t99os, Europe had become a playground for inter-
national bond traders, who were hotly debating the outlook for

prospect--still much in doubt--that France, Germany, Italy, and
other age-oldnation-states would really merge their currencies, aban-

doning their francs, marks, and lire for freshly minted euros. Every
trader had a different view--just the sort of uncertain climate in
which Long-Term thrived. Many investment banks were betting that
bonds issued by the weakercountries, such as Italy and Spain, would
strengthen relative to those of Germany, on the theory that if union
did come about, it would force a convergence of interest rates all
across Europe. Long-Term did someof these trades, but as usual, the
partners were reluctant to risk too much on a broad economic the-
ory. Long-Term'sexpertisewas in the details. When it came to fore-
castinggeopolitical trends, it did not have any apparent edge. What's
more, the mostly American partners were Euro-skeptics. With Eu-
rope's highly regulated economies perennially trailing America's,
the Continent seemedhopelesslyrigid. A Swiss partner, Hans Huf-
schmid,tried to push the convergence theme, but the American part-
ners, including Victor Haghani, the free-spirited London chief,
resisted.
Haghani preferred to focus on strategies that were confined to sin-
glecountries, wherethere would be fewer risk factors. For instance,
he arbitraged two issues of gilts, the British equivalent of Treasurys,
one of which was cheaper owing to an unfavorable tax treatment.
When the U.K. government reversed its stance, I.ong-Term quickly
made $200
million. \177'
Haghani frequently traded the yield curve of a country against it-
self. Thus, he might go long on Germany's ten-year bonds and sell its
five-year paper, a subtle trade that required command of the math
along with a keen appreciation forlocal economic trends. But at least
it did not require comparing the trends in Germany with, say, the
trends in Spain.
Newspaper accountsof Long-Term generally overlooked Haghani,
who was intensely private. The press played up Meriwether's leader-
ship and Merton's and Scholes's\"models '\1. 77But in fact Haghani was
a critical player. While J.M. presided over the firm and Rosenfeld ran
it from day to day, Haghani and the slightly senior Hilibrand had the
most influence on trading. Similarly brilliant and mathematically
adept, they spoke in a code that outsiders found impenetrable.
Although the two operated mostly as a team, Haghani was far
more daring. A natural trader, Haghani had an intuitive feeling for
markets and avolatile, impulsive streak. If a model identified a secu-
rity as mispricedand if the firm felt it understood why the distortion

had occurred, Hilibrand tended to go right ahead. Haghani, who
trusted his instincts, might gamble on the security's becoming even
more mispriced first. Barely thirty-one years old when Long-Term
started (Hilibrand was thirty-four, Rosenfeld forty, and Meriwether
forty-six), the swarthy, bearded Haghani routinely swung for the
fences. Though a lively raconteur, he was less direct than Hilibrand:
you could never tell if Haghani was challenging you in earnest or
playing poker. Hehad a youthful impetuousness and belief in himself,
perhaps the result of his privileged background.
The son ofa wealthy Iranian importer-exporter and an American
mother, Haghani grew up keenly aware of the political crosscurrents
that often overwhelm the best-laid business plans. As a teenager,he
hadspenttwoyears in Iran with his father, whom he adored; then the
rew\177lution had forced them to flee. At Salomon Brothers, Haghani
had spent a lot of time in the London and Tokyobureaus, where he
had pushed the localtraders to adopt the Arbitrage Group's modelof
markets and had exhorted the often bewildered staffers to trade in
bigger size. He returned to London with Long-Term Capital Man-
agement just as the Continent was bubbling with talk of monetary
union.
Haghani shunned the City, London's buttoned-down equivalent of
Wall Street, and rented quarters in Mayfair, a lively fashion district.
He ran the office informally, encouraging the staff to join him in give-
and-take and spirited banter. His traders and analysts worked long
hours, but they were motivated by the lure of Long-Term's growing
profits and humbled by the sight of their boss trundling to the office
on a bicycle. When the action abated, the traders would drift to a
poolroom off the trading floor, where Haghani would issue challenges
to visitors. (J.M., too, on his visits to London, would inevitably pick
up the cue stick and take on all comers.) Less introverted than some
of his partners, Haghani frequently invited traders home to dinner.
After Long-Term's first big month, in May, he assembled the entire
London staff, including the secretaries,and told them how the money
had beenmade. This would have been heresy at the stiffer and more
secretive Greenwich headquarters, where a rigid caste system pre-
vailed.
Haghani's biggest trade was Italy--a bold choice. Italian finance
was a mess, as was Italian politics. The fear that Italy might default
on its loans,coupled with the still considerable strength of the Italian

Communist Party, had pushed Italy's interest rates to as much as 8
percentage points overGermany's--a huge spread. Italy's bond mar-
ket was still evolving, and the government was issuing lots of paper,
partly to attract investors.For bond traders, it was fertile territory.
Obviously, if Italy righted itself, people who had bet on Italy would
make out like bandits. But what if it didn't?
The Italian market was further complicated because Italy had a
quirky tax law and two types of government bonds--one of which
paid a floating rate, the other a fixed rate. Strangely, the Italian gov-
ernment was forced (by an untrusting bond market) to pay an inter-
est rate that was higher than the rate on a widely traded interest rate
derivative known as \"swaps.\" Swap rates are generally close to
private-sector bank rates. Thus, the bond marketwas rating the Ital-
ian government asapoorerrisk than private banks.
Haghani thought the market was seriously overstating the risk of
the govermnent's defaulting--relative to the price it was putting on
other risks. With characteristic derring-do, he recommended a king-
sizearbitrage to exploit the supposed mispricing. It was a calculated
gamble, because if Italy did default, Long-Term's counterparties
might walk away from their contracts--and Long-Termcouldlose its
shirt. To the American partners, who remainedskeptical about Italy,
this was a major worry. The risk-averse Bill Krasker was especially
concerned, and the partners heatedly debated Italy for hours.
In simple terms, the arbitrage zeroed in on the market's utter lack
of respect for Rome. But nothing at Long-Term was ever simple.
Specifically, Haghani, who eventually prevailed, bought the fixed-
rate Italian government bonds and shorted the fixed rate on Italian
swaps.Healso bought the floating-rate government paper, a coupfor
Long-Termbecause few others could get hold of this thinly traded se-
curity. Haghani balanced that with a short position, too. At first,
Long-Term hedged the entire position, taking oL\177ta rather expensive
Italian-default insurance policy (it eventook out a see(rod policy, in
case the insurer went broke). \177B'\1u7t7' as the Italian position got bigger,
Long-Term couldn't afford to keep buying more insurance, and it
simply took achance. An insider judged that had Italy gone bust, the
fund could havelost half of its capital.
The virtually unregulated hedge fund did not disclose its risk in
Italy to investors;indeed, it didn't tell them anything about how and
where their money was invested, save for broad generalities.J.M.'s

letters were saturated with statistics on volatilities but mute on what
the firm was actually doing. Hecovered for his shyness by adopting
an aloof, impersonal tone, as though he were doing his investors a
favor by disclosing anything. \"It is our intent to maintain ongoing
communications with you, our investors,\" he declared stiffly. Even
the few dry nuggets that J.M. diddisclose he asked investors to keep
confidential, as if I.ong-Term's genius were a tender woodland plant
that couldn't tolerate the glare of sunlight. The partners went to ob-
sessive lengths to stay out of the press. They even repurchased the
rights to photographs that had run in Business Week to keep their
pictures from public view.
\225
For all its attention to risk, Long-Term's management had a serious
flaw. Unlike at banks, whereindependentrisk managers watch over
traders, Long-Term's partners monitored themselves T. hough this en-
abled them to sidestep the rigidities of a big organization, there was
noone to call the partners to account.
Tradersneeded approval from the risk-management committee to
initiate a trade; however, Hilibrand and Haghani, who would fight
relentlessly for what they wanted, had a way of getting it. Sooner or
later, the other partners would defer, if only out of sheer exhaustion.
Meriwetherwas largely to blame for this tolerant regime. If J.M. had
a cardinal weakness, it was his failure to insert himself into the de-
bates. And there was no one elsewho could have played the role of
nanny, as there had been at Salomon--no Gutfreund. The traders
were their own watchdogs.
The partners did go to considerable lengths to research their
trades, the Italian trade being a prime example. Haghani recruited a
network of intelligence sourcesto bolster his knowledge of Italy. He
hired--first as a consultant, later full-time--Alberto Giovannini, a
formerofficial in the Italian Treasury and professorat Columbia Uni-
versity. Giovannini, who had alsostudied at MI'I; would shuttle back
and forth between London and Rome, where he couldsee his family
and gossip with Italian officials. Still not satisfied, Haghani brought
in GSrard Gennotte, yet another MIT grad, who was the son of Bel-
gium's ambassador to Italy and was fluent in Italian. \"Victor was al-
ways keen on Italy,\" an associatenoted. And of course, Long-Term
was plugged in to Italy's central bank, which had invested $1oo mil-
lion in the fund and lent it $i So million more.



==================================================
                     PAGE 68                      
==================================================

However, Long-Term's approach was so mathematical, it's doubt-
ful that all this intelligence made much difference. Its models said
simply that Italy was \"cheap\" relative to historical patterns and an-
ticipatedrisks. The partners assumed that, all else being equal, the fu-
ture would look like the past. Therefore, in they went. Moreover, its
models were hardly a secret. \"You could pick up aJournal o\177F\"inance
and see where someone was applying models,\" a London-based
trader at Salomon Brothers noted with respect to the Italy trade.
\"Anyone who had done first-year math at university could do it.\" In
truth, traders at other firms had been doing similar trades foryears.
By the time Eong-Term started to trade, spreads in Italy had begun to
narrow; rival firms were bidding arrizJederci. Haghani got his first bil-
lion dollars' worth or so of Italian bonds from Salomon, which
xvanted out. The common notion that Long-Term had a unique black
box was a myth. Other Wall Street firms had also found their way to
MIT, and most of the big banks were employing similar models--
and, what's more, were applying them to the same couple of dozen
spreads in bond markets.
kong-Term's edge wasn't in its models but, first, m its experience
in reading the models.The partners had been doing such trades for
years.Second, the firm had better financing. During its first year,
Rosenfeld sewed up repo financing with thirty banks and derivative
facilities with twenty--all on liberal terms. -'\17W7ith financing so acces-
sible-and with the partners so supremely confident--I,ong-Term
traded on a greaterscale, and it kept squeezing nickels long after
others had q\177it. \"We focused on smaller discrepancies than other
people,\" one trader said. \"We thought we could hedge further and
leverage further.\"
At leastone observer had grave doubts about the flmd's seemingly
cavalier approach to debt.Seth Klarman, the general partner of Bau-
postGroup, a collection of smallish hedge funds bascd m Cambridge,
Massachusetts, wrote to his invcstors that hc had beenoffcredastake
in a new fund run by former Salomon bond traders--obviously l,ong-
Term--and had declined. Klarman was perturbed by a seemingly
reckless trend on Wall Street. Investment banks possessed of the
equivalent of financial Vcg-O-Matics were slicing and dicing financial
assets into potent, newfangled securities--lOs and POs--that in-
vestors werescooping up with reckless 81an. What was worse, in-
vestors had rediscovered their thirst for leverage. With double-digit
bond yields a thing of the past, investors--particularly the new hedge

funds that were \"popping up all over\"--were resorting to borrowing
to inflate their returns. How could investors be so certain that mar-
kets would always be liquid?, Klarman wondered. He feared that in-
vestors were turning \"a blind eye to the consequences of 'outlier'
events,\" such as the sudden disturbances and occasional crashes that,
historically, have always upset the best-laid plans of investors. In gen-
eral, Klarman warned, \"Successful investors have positioned them-
selvesto aw\177id the xoo-year flood. Increasingly, that way of thinking
has becomepassf.\" Turning to the former Salomon traders' fund--
that is, to Long-Term--Klarman noted that, given its projected lever-
age,evena single serious mistake would put a \"major dent\" in the
fund's capital. \"Two major errors at the same time, of course, would
be catastrophic.\"-'-'

percent. In a year in which the average investor in bonds had lost
money, this was nothing short of phenomenal. In October, when it
was clear that the fund would finish with impressive numbers, Meri-
wether warned his investors not to count on a repeat. Long-Term
would very likely have years in which it lost money, J.M. stressed: \"It
is clear that significant lossescanoccur even over a one-year hori-
zon.\" All good money managers write such letters. If they understand
their business, they know they can havebadyears. If they are honest,
they let their investors know it or at least try to temper their expec-
tations.
Yet J.M.'s letter went a good deal further. In an attachment penned
by his two academic stars, Merton and Scholes, l.ong-Term did not
merely concede the possibility of loss, it calculated the supposed odds
of its occurring, and to precise mathematical degrees. Just as a hand-
book of poker might tell you that the odds of drawing an inside
straight were 8.5 x percent, the professors calculated that Long-Term
would lose at least5percent of its money xz percent of the time (that

is, in twelve of every hundred years). The letter went on to state the
preciseodds of the fund's losing at least \177opercent, as well as I5 per-
cent and 2o percent.'
Of course, Long-Termcould jigger the odds by changing certain
assumptions; thus the letter contained not just one column of num-
bers but multiple columns, like a page from the Daily Racing Form.
The point was, Long-Termpredicted the odds with precision. It was
as if the professors had some secretknowledgeor an altered view of
the world, for no ordinary investor would hazard such forecasts.
Most people,one hopes, know that their stocks can fall, but if
asked to specify the odds, they would most likely blink in puzzle-
ment. Indeed, Long-Term's letter betrayed a different way of think-
ing about the world. Imagine, for a moment, that a student at your
child's school showed symptoms of a contagious and potentially
dangerous disease. You would expect a warning, perhaps somead-
vice on what precautions to take. But if a letter arrived from the
principal stating that your child had a t9 percent chance of catch-
ing the sickness, a \1772percent chance of missing at least a week of
school, and a 2 percent risk of fatality, you would find it a trifle
odd, not to mention presumptuous. You would want to know more
about the school's doctor and, in particular, about the kind of med-
icine he practiced.
\225
In truth, Long-Term's letter told a great deal about the fund's phil()-
sophical \"medicine.\" It mentioned no specific trades or investments;
it didn't have to. It is enough to know that for each investment, Long-
Termwas chiefly concerned with two questions: What was the antic-
ipated average return, and how much did the return in any typical
year tend to vary from that average? With a pair ofdice, for instance,
the average roll is 7, and the variation from the average cannot be
more than 5 (you can't roll more than t2 or less than 2). What's
more, the odds in dice are such that two thirds of the time, you will
roll either 7 or a number that is within two of 7.
Therefore, if a sensible investor was offered the chance to bet even
money on rolling between 5 and 9, he would take it. Of course, you
wouldn't always roll between 5 and 9, so you wouldn't, one hopes,
wager too much. But what if you could make that bet on i million
rolls and settle up only at the end? In that case, you should bet the

==================================================

DEAR INVESTORS \22563
house. You might roll snakeeyesonce, maybe a second time, perhaps
a third. But over a million rolls, the chance of losing is infinitesimally
small. Try it.
It is much harder to calculatethe odds in investing; indeed, very
few aspects of life can be forecast so precisely(good fortune-tellers
are scarce). We may deduce that if we buy a shareofIBM at $80 we
have a greater chance of making a profit than if we buy at $90, just
as your child is at greater risk if two of his buddiesaresick, rather
than only one. But how \177nuch greater? We simply don't haveenough
factsto quantify either the risk of market lossor the risk of conta-
gion.
Notice that there is a key differencebetweena share of IBM (or an
infectious disease) and a pair of dice. With dice, there is risk--you
could, after all, roll snake eyes--but there is no uncertainty, because
you know (for certain) the chances of getting a 7and everyotherre-
suit. Investing confronts us with both risk and uncertainty. There isa
risk that the price of ashare of IBM will fall, and there is uncertainty
about how likely it is to do so. So many variables--political, eco-
nomic, managerial, competitivefactors---can affect the result that the
uncertainty all but overwhehns us.
Seen in these terms, Long-Term's letter represented a dramatic
leap. While it heartily acknowledged risk, it banished uncertainty by
putting numerical odds on its likelihood of loss. To J.M. and his
traders, money management was lessan \"art\" requiring a series of
judgments than it was a \"science\" that could be precisely quantified.
\"Roughly, over a long period of time,\" the letter stated, \"investors
may experiencealoss of 5% or more in about one month in five, and
aloss of \1707% or more in about one month in ten.\" Only one year in
fifty should it lose at least zo percent of its portfolio--and the
Merton-Scholes encyclicaldid not entertain the possibility of losing
more.
Thesecret of this magical foretelling was breathtakingly simple.
Just as the key number in the dice bet was the typical variance from
7, the key number for Long-Term was the usual variance, or volatil-
ity, in bond prices. By plugging tens of thousands of bond prices
into its SPARC computers, Long-Term's traders knew the historic
volatility--that is, how much bonds had fluctuated in the past. And
that one number (calculated over thousands of daily, monthly, and
yearly intervals and for numerous types ofbonds)was the basis of

==================================================

64 \225WHEN GENIUS FAILED
their assessment of risk in the future. Peter Rosenthal, Long-Term's
pressspokesman, glibly explained, \"Risk is a function of volatility.
These things are quantifiable.\" Meriwether, Merton, Scholes, and
company had no more earnest belief.
Their portfolio was like a hat holding thousands of pairs of num-
bers,each representing the volatility and return they expected in a
given trade. \"They were thinking all the time about the numbers in
the hat,\" noted Robert Stavis, who worked in the group at Salomon.
Theywere looking at the individual pairs--the lOs, the Italys, and so
on--but they were also thinking about the correlations between the
pairs. Would the results in mortgages tend to mimicthose in Italy?
Would one trade be up when the other was down? The partners ad-
justed the weighting of each trade according to its effect both on re-
turn and on volatility, singly and for the entire portfolio, Stavis said.
\"And they'd constantly be tuning the mix.\"
\225
Meriwether's traders were profoundly concerned with limiting risk.
The idea that they could do so by targeting a specific level ofvolatil-
ity was central to how they ran the fund. If the portfolio was a lit-
tle too quiet, they'd borrow more, raising the \"vol\"; if it was too
volatile, they'd reduce their leverage, cahning the fund down.
Rather than target a specific return, they engineered the \"hat\" so
that (they believed) it would fluctuate during most years about
as much as the stock market did. With any more volatility, the
risk would be too high. With less, they would be leaving money on
the table. \"To anyone with their theoretical background,\" noted
Merrill'sDale Meyer, who helped sell the fund, \"volatility and re-
turns were the same thing. Increased volatility meant increased re-
turns.\"
If this seems unremarkable, it is only because, by the i99os , this
approach had permeated most of Wall Street. Trading rooms had
adopted the academics' faith in numeric certainties; risk managers at
banks monitored volatilities as though they contained the Holy Grail.
A senior executiveatJ. P. Morgan, when asked how he defined risk,
breezily replied, \"As volatility around the mean.\" The conceit of
modern Wall Street was that the closing prices printed in each day's
Wall Street Journal wereas reliable and predictive about the future as
the actuarial tables of life insurance companies or the known and cer-



==================================================

DEAR INVESTORS \22565
tain odds in shooting craps. And the conceitstemmed largely from
Merton and Scholes. Every investment bank, every trading floor on
Wall Street was staffed by young, intelligent Ph.D.s who had studied
under Merton, Scholes, or their disciples.The same firms that spent
tens of millions of dollars per year on expensiveresearchanalysts--
i.e.,
stock pickers--staffed their trading desks with finance majors
who put capital at risk on the assumption that the market was effi-
cient, meaning that stock prices were ever correctand therefore that
stock picking was a fraud.
SomeofI.ong-Term's investors had learned this credo practically
in the crib. Terence Sullivan, who kept notes on his meetings with
Long-Term, believed it would take a rare, \"calamitous\" event--
maybe a once-in-a-hundred-year flood--for Long-Term to go seri-
ously wrong. There would be times, Sullivan knew, when prices
would deviate from the norm and when markets would move against
Long-Term, costing it money. But for the markets in all of their trades
to consistently depart from the norm would be a statistical freak, like
rolling seven consecutive snake eyes or being hit by lightning twice.
Sullivan had learned this long before, in business school at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh--which, like all such schools,wassteeped in the
teachings of Merton and Scholes.
\225
Neither Merton nor Scholes was involved in trading at Long-Term
except in a minor, advisory sense. Nor, assome investors believed, did
the professors create the \"models\" that detailed the casesforvarious
trades. But Merton and Scholes were the fund's philosophical fathers.
As Scholesremarked at its inception, \"We're not just a fund. We're a
financial-technology company.\"\177' More specifically, I\177ong-Term was
an experiment in managing risk by the numbers. At the center of this
experimentwas the notion of volatility, which had supplanted lever-
age, in the partners' minds, as the best proxy for risk. Indeed, many
of Long-Term's trades were attempts to t.xploit spreads that, in its
view, reflected an inaccurate estimatt, of future volatility risk--the
one risk that (to Long-Term) really counted. Such strategies had
evolved directly from the Black-Scholes formula.
The formula had built on discoveries in the physical sciences. Stat-
isticians had long beenaware of the \"law of large numbers.\" Roughly
speaking, if you have enough samples of a random event, they will

66 \225WHEN GENIUS FAILED
tend to distribute in the familiar bell curve, with the most occurrences
around the average and a sharp drop-off at either extreme. Thisis
called the normal distribution or, in mathematical terms, the log-
normal distribution. A basketball coach knows that, given the usual
distribution of heights, on a block with one hundred school-age boys
he is likely to find sixty to seventy boys of roughly average height, a
few who are short and a few who are tall, and maybeone who could
play starting center. If the coach is lucky, he might find two centers.
But he would never find, say, twenty seven-footers on that single
street--assuming, of course, that the families are unrelated, for oth-
erwise the selection would not be random. As Peter Bernstein has
written, nature's pattern emerges only from the chaotic disorder of
many random events.\177
To Black, Scholes, and Merton, price changes in financial markets
were random, too.* No one could predict any particular change, but
over a long enough period, they assumed that the distribution ofall
such prices would mirror the pattern of other random events, like
coin flips, dice rolls, or the heights of high school students. The mar-
ket for Italian bonds and on-the-run Treasurys would also describe a
bell curve, with many days in which priceschanged only a little either
up or down and a very few observations at the extremes, represent-
ing sudden upswings or market plunges.
If the amount of the typical change--the \"volatility\"--were
known, they believed, the odds that a stock, bond, or any other
asset would rise or fall by some proportion over time couldbede-
rived as well. The differential equations usedto solve the Black-
Scholes formula wereadapted from physics equations that describe,
among other phenomena in the physical world, the way cream
spreads through a cup of coffee2 Any one molecule's trip is ran-
dom, but as a group, the molecules distribute themselves in pre-
dictable fashion, from the center out. The cream will never go all to
one side.
Black-Scholes says that prices don't (predictably)go to one side ei-
ther. In valuing an option, which is the right to buy a security at a
stated \"strike price\" in the future, all that matters is the volatility, or
* The Black-Scholes formula explicitly states, \"We will assume ideal condi-
tions in the market for the stock and for the option.... The stock price follows
arandom walk in continuous time.\"

the rate at which the underlying security jumps around. '= This makes
intuitive sense: the more a security fluctuates, the more likely it is to
rise above the strike price.
But Black-Scholes makesa very key assumption: that the volatility
of a security is constant. To say that the value of an option to buy
IBM depends on its volatility is meaningless unless you can agree on
what its volatility is.Therefore,the professors treated the volatility of
a security likean inherent, unchanging trait. You have blue eyes;IBM
hasa w\177latility of X. You or I might assume that the market fluctua-
tions of so many yesterdays are so much noise--arbitrary, not neces-
sarily likely to recur, and best forgotten. But to Black, Scholes, and
Merton--and to Long-Term--these fluctuations were invested with
deep predictivesignificance E. ach tick of the market up or down was
latent with an unerring forecast of future risk. This implied that mar-
ketswere efficient and rational at every step.
Merton carried the assumption a step further. He assumed that
volatility was so constant that prices would trade in \"continuous
time\"--in other words, without any jumps. Merton's markets wereas
smooth as well-brewed java, in which prices would indeed flow like
cream. He assumed, for instance, that the price of a share of IBM
would never plunge directly from 80to 60 but would always stop at
797.\177, 7972, and 79'/4 along the xvay.
At each infinitesimal moment, traders would readjust the price of
options on IBM, keeping them in synchrony with the price of the
stock. And traders who owned both could--by nimbly buying or
selling--keep their portfolio in an Edenic, risk-freestate of balance.
In short, Merton assumedaperfect, risk-free arbitrage. This assump-
tion may approximate real markets when they are calm--but only
then. In i987, so-called portfolio insurance was marketed (with ab-
surd ballyhoo) to institutional investors as a technique of limiting
losses via continuous selling when markets fall. These portfolio in-
surers helped to exacerbate a market crash that was later dubbed
BlackMonday. That day, the market was highly discontinuous. Port-
folio insurers who had counted on nimbly limiting their losses

the Black-Scholes formula. They include the duration of the option, the level of
interest rates, and thespread between the current priceof the underlying security
and the price at which the option can beexercised.

couldn't keep pace with the panic that broke out on Wall Street and,
indeed,lost
their shirts.
\225
Merton's perfect-arbitrage assumption was an essential building
block in Long-Term's (and many other firms'/hedging strategies. The
partners, ofcourse, had worked with the same risk assumptions at
Salomon Brothers and had racked up phenomenal profits--albeit
with the occasional nasty loss. This gave them tremendous confi-
dence. Their trades usually \177ere sensible, meaning that they were
aligned with the odds. Nonetheless, the fact that the group's ship
hadn't capsized in the past didn't guarantee that the group had prop-
erly calculated the odds of a tidal wave--just that such waves were
relatively infrequent.
Merton's theories were seductive not because they were mostly
wrong but because they were so nearly, or so nearly often, right.
Academics have debated and no doubt will continue to debate such
modelsforyears. As the English essayist G. K.Chesterton wrote, life
is % trap for logicians\" because it is almost reasonable but not quite;
it is usually sensible but occasionally otherwise:
It looks iust a little more mathematical and regular than it is; its
exactitude isobvious, but its inexactitude is hidden; its wildness
lies in wait. \177
Merton was prey to this very trap. His \"continuous-time finance\"
seemed to wrap the financial universe in a tidy ball. Onpaper it solved,
or pointed to the solutions for, virtually every problem in finance: how
to value junk bonds, how much to pay for depositinsurance, you name
it. His theories see\177ned to behold the elegance and order he had always
craved. \"Not all that is l\177cautiful in science need also be practical,\" he
wrote with satisfaction. \"But hcrc wc havc l\177oth.'
Eric Rosenfeld, who had studied at MI'I' m the t97os , looked up to
Merton as an \"unbelievable mathematician.\" Ilc noted that a single
unpublished paper of Merton's had trig,\177crcd a host of dissertations
by a cadre of inspired disciples.Of course, Merton's entire oeuvre
depended on his assumptions about random walks, with their close
tie-in to the physical world. As the unassuming Rosenfeld described
it, he and his fellow Mertonprotegesused to run to the physics library
looking for formulaic solutions that they could \"jam into finance.\"

While studying with Merton, Rosenfeld played a came() role in de-
veloping financial software, which was the bridge that brought the
math to Wall Street. He and a friend, Mitchell Kapor, were early
devoteesof the Apple II, at a time when little software existed for it.
Kapor thought computers were cool, and Rosenfeldwas using quan-
titative systems for investing as well as for betting on football. In
1978, Rosenfeld, who was writing his thesis and spending gobs of
time at the university computer center,asked Kapor if he could write
a program that would run on the Apple. Kapor did--and realized
they were on to something. Thetwo became partners in a tiny com-
pany called Micro Finance Systems. They published adesktop graph-
ics and statistics program known as Tiny TROLL that was just
powerful enough to do useful work. It sold thousands ofcopies, and
Kapor and Rosenfeld made hundreds of thousands of dollars on it.
Kapor, a former disc iockeyand teacher of transcendental medita-
tion, thought he had discovered the next wave. He hatched plans for
a second venture and invited Rosenfeld to ioin him. But Kapor had
also caught the finance bug. He was so intrigued by his friend's ac-
count ofhowstocks mimicked molecules that be enrolled at MIT. But
after Kapor took Merton's finance course, hedecided that quantita-
tive finance was lessascience than a faith--a doctrine for ideologues
\"blinded by the power of the model.\" It appealed to intellectuals who
craved a sense of order but could lead them disastrously astray if
markets moved outside the model. Kapor went on to form I,otusDe-
velopment Corporation and became an icon of the software industry.
Rosenfeld, who had gotten a iob teaching at Harvard, staked his roy-
alties from Tiny TROLL on two other ventures--one of which, a
chartered sailboat, almost sank on its maiden w\177yage--and lost a lot
of money.
\177
Kapor wasn't the only one who wondered if Merton's model might
be too tidy for the real world. Paul Samuelson,Merton's mentor at
MIT, had doubts when Long-Term was organized. Samuelson, the
first financial economist to win a Nobel Prize, recognized that \"con-
tinuous time\" was merely an idealstate; in real time, traders took sec-
onds, minutes, or even hours to analyze events and react. When
events overwhelmed them, the markets gapped.Heat molecules
didn't iump out of line; IBMmost certainly did. \"This is very impor-
tant to the Long-Term story,\" Samuelsonnoted. \"The essence of the
Black-Scholes formula is that you know, with certainty, not what the

deal of the cards will be but what kind of universe is being sampled,
which gives you the assumption of the log-normal process.I won-
dered back then [when Long-Termstartedl. ''\177
The beauty of cards is that the universe is known; there are fifty-two
cards in a deck, and only fifty-two. Life insurance is a bit different:
since new people are always being added to the universe, actuaries rely
on samplings. They aren't perfect, but they work, because the sample
ofpeopleis very large and mortality rates change only very slowly. But
in markets, we are never sure that the sample iscomplete. The universe
of all trades looked one way throughout the \17792os and another way
after the Great Depression. The pattern changed again during the in-
flationary i97os , yet again in the effervescent i99os. After which of
these periods was the picture \"normal,\" and how dowe know that the
next new period won't change the story again? To focus on a single
company, IBM lives in a dynamic, ever-changing world, in which man-
agers perpetually confront new possibilities, new problems, and novel
products, the risks of each of which would seem impossible to quan-
tify. If a manager at BigBlue proposedto rely on the past as an accu-
rate gauge of future risk, he would probably befired.
Eugene Fama, Scholes's thesis adviser, wondered what his old stu-
dent was up to as well. Fama had all the admiration in the world for
the option formula as a model. But trusting people's money to such
modelswas different. In the early \17976os, Fama had written his thesis
on the price movements of the thirty Dow Jones Industrial Average
stocks and discovered a remarkable pattern: for every stock, there
were many more days of extreme price movements than would occur
in a normal distribution. Fama's stocks were like a world in which
most people were average height but every twentieth person was ei-
ther a giant or a dwarf. There were too many extreme readings, or
\"outliers,\" that random distribution could not explain. As Fama
put it:
If the population of price changes is strictly normal, on the av-
eragefor any stock.., an observation more than five standard
deviations from the mean should be observed about once every
7,000 years. In fact such observations seem to occur about once
every three to four years2
Graphically, Fama's stocks depicted a bell curve with the ends
swollen, representing too many incidents at the extremes (known as

the \"tails\.") Fama's thesis, which he undoubtedly discussed with
Scholes, was rife with implications for the future Long-Term Capital.
In contrast to the idealized markets in models, Famawarned, real-life
ones experienced \"discontinuous\" price changes(those nasty jumps)
and a higher probability of large losses; indeed, \"such a market is in-
herently more risky.\" '\177'
By the time Long-Term was formed, it was well documented that
virtually all financial assets behaved like the stocks that Fama had
studied.\" Mortgage securities might usually behave asthe modelpre-
dicted, but there would come a day when--with no warning at all--
they would leap off the charts. As Fama put it, \"Life always has a fat
tail.\"'-' A few months after J.M.'s letter, the Mexican peso collapsed
and investors panicked, setting off a chain reaction from Texas to
TierradelFuego. The markets in Argentina and Venezuela were not
independent dice; they collapsed simultaneously. Confidence wasn't
restored until Robert Rubin, the \"Deasury secretary and former
Goldman arbitrageur, organized a bailout.
If you follow the market evencasually, you probably have a gut
feeling that stocks (or bonds) are often inexplicably w31atile; they do
an awful lot of bouncing around. The most obvious example was
Black Monday, when, on no apparent news, the market plunged 23
percent. Economists later figured that, on the basis of the market's
historic w3latility, had the market been open every day since the cre-
ation of the Universe, the odds would still have been against its
falling that much on any single day. In fact, had the life of the Uni-
verse been repeated one t\177illion times, such a crash would still have
been theoretically \"unlikely.\" '\177But it happened anyway. Obviously,
past w\177latilities do not prepare investors for shocks that lie in wait--
nor do they signal in advance just when such shocks might choose to
OCCUF.
There is a reason why financial markets run to extremes more
often than coin flips--and more often than the \"hundred-year storm\"
that l,ong-Term'spartners would later cite as the culprit behind their
disaster. A key condition of random events is that each new flip is
dependent of the previous one. The coin doesn't remember that it
landed on tails three times in a row; the odds on the fourth flip are
still fifty-fifty,
But markets have memories. Sometimesa trend will continue just
because traders expect(or fear) that it will. Investors may slavishly fol-

low the trend for no other reason than that they think enough others
will do likewise. Such momentum trading has nothing to do with log-
ically appraising securities; it doesn't fit the ideal of rational investors
in efficient markets. But it's human. After three bad \"flips\" in the mar-
ket, the fourth flip may no longer becompletelyrandom.Some traders
may have taken losses and be forced to sell; other investors, looking
over their shoulders, may panic and decideto beat them to it--as hap-
pened with Treasury bonds during Long-Term's inaugural spring.
Wherever the human spirit is present, the little runs that Fama noticed,
and even big, Black Monday-sized runs, are possible.*'4
This human spirit was totally absent from Merton's markets.
Though he acknowledged that his models represented an ideal state,
his writing was suffused with the notion of perfectprices and ratio-
nal investors. Even his prose was wooden and dry, as if he were try-
ing to boil off life'semotional content and reduce it to a controlled
abstraction. His passion for his subject electrified students in the
classroom, but on a personal level, the curly-haired, plump-cheeked
professor was formal and aloof. Aside from his Ferrari, Heaven, to
him, wasadeep academic discussion. I--Iewas generous with his time,
particularly with students, but not disposed m give-and-take or to
changing his mind. \"It was like listening to Billy Graham,\" a student
recalled.
The evangelical Merton showed disdain for the very possibility
that investors could be anything but calculating automatons, and
he blithely ignored the times when their emotions ran riot. Thus,
he took credit for the contribution that his theories made to \"the
portfolio-insurance products of the \17798os\"--as if he were blind to
the fact that, when real peoplehad tried thoseproducts, portfolio in-
surance had miserably failed.\" Even the word \"speculative\" he put
into quotes, as though the notion that it might apply to real investors
was so unpleasant he had to handle it with forceps. Indeed, when
Merton referred to \"well-known and colorful passages by Keynes,\"
he was knocking the English economist and man ofletters for the sin
*Curiously, Fama devoted the rest of his career to justifying the efficient-
market hypothesis.He argued that Black Monday had been a rational adjust-
ment to a (one-day?) change in underlying corporatc values. On the other hand,
Lawrence Summers, now the U.S. Treasury secretary, told The Wall Street Jour-
nalafter the crash, \"The efficient market hypothesis isthemost remarkable error
in the history of economic theory.\"

of letting a vivid, human adjective or two slip into his copy. Hc
the disease of perfect belief, which makes compromise impossible.
When Robert J. Shiller, an Americaneconomist,dared to suggest that
markets were too volatile to fit the model of perfect markets, you
could sense that for Merton, to entertain any doubt at all was to risk
seeing the entire edifice crumble: \"We need hardly mention the sig-
nificance of such a conclusion. If Shiller's rejection of market effi-
ciency is sustained, then serious doubt is cast on the validity of this
cornerstone ofmodern financial economic theory.\"'\"
The traders at Long-Term knew the models were imperfect, of
course. \"We know this doesn't work by rote,\" said Robert Stavis, the
former member of the Arbitrage Group at Salomon. \"But this is the
best model we have. You look at the old-timerswho went with their
gut. You had this model, you had these numbers, and in the end you
thought they were a lot more powerful than a guy's gut.\"
Long-Term'straders were not automatons. They debated, some-
times hotly, for hours every week,about what the models implied and
whether to do what the modelsrecommended T. hey were also aware
of the \"fat tail\" criticism--the idea that unexpected disaster should
be expected--and they tried to adjust the modelsfor it. But can one
ever program for the unexpected? Most of l.ong-Tcrm's trades were
low risk, but they were not no risk. Norwas the degree of risk pre-
ciselyquantifiable. The problem with the math is that it adorned with
certitude events that were inherently uncertain. \"You take Monica
Lewinsky, who walks into Clinton's office with a pizza. You have no
idea where that's going to go,\" Conseco's Max Bublitz, who had de-
clined to invest in Long-Term, noted. \"Yet if you apply math to it,
you come up with a thirty-eight percent chance she's going to go
down on him. It looks great, but it's all a guess.\"
By the mid-\17799os, this distinction was as hopt'lcssly lost on Wall
Street as it was in Greenwich. Banks from Merrill to Morgan to
BankersTrust were computing, to the ti\177icst fraction, the supposed
amount by which their trades could fall in any day, month, or year.
Even the Federal Reserve was endorsing such programs, which went
by the generic name \"Value-at-Risk.\" Beneath the programs' sophis-
ticated veneer, they amounted to asking, \"If n\177arkets behave as they
have in the past, how much will we lose?\" But what if markets did
something different? History, Mark Twain noted, rhymes; it does not
repeat. \177r

Such programs worked until they failed to work--as they did in
Mexico in \179795. And they failed preciselyat moments of unexpected
turbulence--when they were needed most. They were like insurance
for all the days when it didn't storm; they predicted what one would
lose on a normal day but not when the peso collapsed. David
DcRosa, a currency trader who teachesatYale,dubbed Value-at-Risk
\"a lighthouse for the soon-to-be-shipwrecked.\"J. P. Morgan, which
pioneered the methodology (under the brand name RiskMetrics),
candidly admitted its flaws. In a document datedOctoberi994, the
same month as Meriwether's letter, Morgan admitted that markets
did not appear to be random or independent in the way of coin flips
and that w31atilities \"are themselves quite w31atile.\" Nonetheless, the
firm, and its imitators all over Wall Street, continued to use Value-at-
Risk. Morgan couldn't find any \"persuasive alternatives,\" '\17t7he bank
explained--as if that would make up for its shortcomings.
Of all the firms that subscribed to Value-at-Risk, Long-Term was
the archetype. '\177T'he professors' addendum read like the notes from
one of Morton's lectures; it confidently informed investors that re-
turns in the stock market were, indeed, independently (randomly)
distribnted. What's more, they stressed that kong-Tcrm expected its
returns to be negatively correlated from one periodto the next,
meaning that a down month would likely be followed by a good
month and so on, thus making sustained losing streaks even less
likely. \"A low return in any one quarter may be more likely to be
followed by a higher return in the subsequent quarter,\" Merton and
Scholesargued. Over time, that was logical, becauseover time mar-
kets do correct their mistakes. Otherwise, there would be no point
in buying mispriced securities. But what if, before prices corrected,
they got further--drastically further--out of line, as had happened
to Eckstein in the I97OS? That was a possibility the letter didn't
mention.
A central tenet of the partners' philosophy was that markets were
steadily getting more efficient, more liquid, more \"continuous\"--
moreas Merton had envisioned them.:\" With moreinvestors hunting
for mispriced securities and with market news traveling faster, it
seemed logical that investors would take less time to correct mistaken
prices. And on most days, they probably did. An efficient market isa
less volatile one (it has no BlackMondays) and, from day to day, a
less risky one. Spreads should therefore contract. Thisboosted the

partners' confidence that spreads would narrow. Indeed, they wcrc
confident enough to leveragesuch bets many times over.
\225
Although global investors were burned by the Mexican fiasco, Long-
Termwas unaffected, and its stirring success continued. In fact, in
1995, as earliertradesbore fruit, the firm's results improved. Italy, no
longer looking like the Continent's problem child, was being hailed
as the design capital of Europe, morecreative than Germany and less
hobbled by tradition than France. Asother traders grasped Italy's po-
tential for growth, the bond market in Rome began to percolate, and
Long-Term's
profits swelled.\177\"
Thanks to Italy and the IO mortgage trade in particular, Long-
Term in t995 earned an astounding .79percent before fees and 43
percent after. A little over half of the gains came from Europe. Dur-
ing its first two years, in which Long-Term had earned a remarkable
$\177.6 billion, Italy contributed an estimated $600 million in profits.
All told, it was the fastest, most impressive start by any fund ever. For
an investor who had started on day one, each original dollar had
swelled by 71 percent,evenaftcr the partnership group had taken its
robust cut. It did not hurt J.M.'s mood that Salomon Brothers was
struggling in his absence. The bank had suffered wrenching losses in
\177994 and was widely rumored to be up for sale.
Meriwether's only nagging worry was that Long-Term hadn't been
volatile enough. The fund had told investorsto expect an accordion,
with pockets of lossestucked between its bellows, but over the first
two years, in only one month had Long-Term lost more than \177per-
cent. \"Where's the accordion?\"one investor wondered. To William E
Sharpe, a Nobel Prize-winning economist and an adviser to one of
Long-Term's investors, the re'turns seemed surrcally smooth. \"We dis-
tinctly asked, 'What's the risk?'\"Sbarpc r\242'called. \"Myron ]Scholes]
said, 'Well, our goal isto getthe risk level ]the volatility] of the S&P
5oo. ' He said, 'We're having trouble getting it that big.'\"
With such a stellar start, l,o\177g-Tc'rm, again with Merrill Lynch,
had no trouble raising an additiot\177al $\177billion of new money. Meri-
wether almost allowed himself a t\177ote \242\1p7r7ifde. Writing to investors,
he noted that Long-Term had swelled to sixteen partners and ninety-
six people overall, about half of them involved in trading and strat-
egy. \177H'e stressed the firm's elitecharacter--its bilingual staffers, its

many Ph.D.s, its sophisticated \"financial technology.\" J.M. had been
parsing the odds all his life: Long-Termwasto be the pinnacle of his
work--a grand, supremelyorchestrated symphony of risk taking.
Including the money from new investors, the firm's equity capital
had, in less than two years, virtually tripled, to a total of $3.6 billion.
Long-Term'asssets had also grown, to the extraordinary sum of $102.
billion. Thus, attheendof \197795, it was leveraged z8to \177.Of course,
its return on total assets--both those that it owned and those that it
had borrowed--was far, far less than the gaudy return cited above.
This return on total capital was approximately z.45percent. -'\17T7his
minuscule figure is what Long-Term would have earned had it in-
vested only its own money. But even this figure is too high because
it doesn't reflect Long-Term's derivative trades, which, as noted,
weren't recorded on its balance sheet. But derivatives most certainly
increased Long-Term's exposure. (Whether you buy a bond or simply
bet on its price, you are exposed to the same potential gain or loss.)
And these off-balance-shee tt rades most definitely increased Long-
Term'sriskiness.
Taking its derivative trades into account, its cash-on-cash return
was probably less than 1 percent. -'4The exact number is unimportant.
The point is that almost all of its heady 59 percent return was due
to the remarkable power of leverage. Seen in this light, Sharpe's
question--What was the risk?--would be difficult to answer. A cash
investor risks his out-of-pocket investment, but Long-Term didn't
makesuchan up-front commitment. Its derivative trades, in particu-
lar, required no capital up front. The fund simply settled with its
banks each day, paying or receiving cash depending on which way a
trade had moved. In lieu of working capital, Long-Termdesignated a
hypothetical slice of its equity as standing behind each trade. Thisso-
called risk capital represented the capital that Long-Term figured it
needed to keep in the vault, just in case. Rosenfeldrecalled,
Even though we didn't getchargeda haircut, we had a risk man-
agementprocess where we calculated our hypothetical working
capital. We went through every trade and said,\"Supposewe are
in a really stressful time,how much would the haircut be?\"
As Long-Term's strategies grew more diverse, the fund felt com-
fortable taking bigger positions. It focused on its portfolio as a whole,
and thus it was willing to pile bigger trades onto each of its \"risk\"

dollars back in the vault. The theory, of course,was that the likeli-
hood of many leveragedtrades collapsing simultaneously was slim,
iust as an insurer does not expect that all of its clients will file claims
simultaneously.
Indeed, Long-Term thought of itself in exactly those terms:as an
insurer of financial risk. In effect, the fund pocketed premiumsfor the
hazard of owning less liquid and generally riskier bonds--the premi-
ums being the spreads that it earned on off-the-run Treasurys, mort-
gageIOs, Italian bonds, and so forth. Of course, the rub with
insurance is that it takes a while before onecan tell whether the pre-
mium isadequate. A property and casualty insurer will always make
money in a year without serious storms. But after such a year oreven
severalgood years, it is fair to ask, Was the insurer that good, or was
it merely lucky? Were the premiums adequate,or was it writing too
many inexpensive insurance policies for seaside homes on wooden
stilts--with little thought to the potential for claims? And if each of
Long-Term's bonds was, in effect, a \"policy,\" the number of policies
it insured--and the level of losses it could someday face--would
grow with each added dollar of leverage.The question the partners
could have asked themselveswas, how hard had they stretched to
make that 59 percent, and wi\177at sort of claims might they face after
a storm?

come. Long-Term was not only phenomenally profitable, it was
eerily consistent, as though defying a law of nature. The fund resem-
bled a batter who hit for power but never struck out. The partners
strode to the plate and rapped hit after hit, day after day. More con-
fident than ever, they lengthened their swing, which is to say they
leveraged further. By the spring of \179796, Long-Term had an astound-
ing $\1774o billion in assets, thirty times its underlying capital. Though
still unknown to 99 percentof Americans, Long-Term was two and
a half times as big as Fidelity Magellan, the largest mutual fund, and
four times the sizeof the next largest hedge fund. \17M7eriwether, Hili-

However, Long-Term was not a secretto its banks. After the event,

it was widely reported that Wall Street had somehow been ignorant

In a strict sense, this may have been true. Komansky and Corzine
may have not known. But peoplebeneath them knew. Long-Term dis-
closed its total assets and liabilities to its banks on a quarterly basis
and to investors every month. Long-Term also reported those nun>
bers to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. It reported its
derivative totals only annually--too infrequently to give an accurate
picture of such a fast-growing firm. Still, the numbers indicated (to
anyone who cared to look) that something big was brewing. Long-
Term disclosed derivative bets as of the end of i995 on a total of
$650 billion of securities--not exactly chicken feed. \177As Brooksley
Born, chairwoman of the CFTC, would candidly admit, \"We didn't
see any major warning bells and we knew lthe information] was
fairly widely available.''; Thomas Bell, Long-Term's outside counsel,
was more right than most when he observed,\"People got statements.
It was a failure to connect the dots.\"
But this was not the whole picture either. On their own, Long-
Term's vaguely worded disclosures were next to meaningless. Aside
from broad generalizations such as \"interest rate swaps\" or \"govern-
ment securities,\" it was impossibleto tell what its assets were. The
derivative disclosures were especially opaque. Imagine asking your
local bank for apersonal loan on the basis of your \"real estate assets\"
without bothering to say whether the rcal estatewas in Appalachia
or in Beverly Hills.
With regard to particular assets--say, mortgage securitiesor Ital-
ian bonds--each bank knew only its own exposure to I,ong-Term.
Goldman Sachs had no idea that Sahmnm might be financing a sim-
ilar trade; J. P.Morgan would not have km)wn that Merrill Lynch
was duplicating Morgan's loans. So m theory, each bank had no no-
tion of how big Long-Term was in any particular trade. But in prac-
tice, the banks were in a good position to estimate. The world of
bond arbitrage is relatively small. Certainly, the banks knew enough

to ask for more specificdisclosure A. nd of course, they could have
declinedto dobusiness with Long-Term if satisfactory answers were
\177ot forthcoming.
But the banks were fighting to do more hedge fund business, not
less. Five years into a bull market, the banks were awash in liquidity,
and the hedge fund trade was a lucrative way for Wall Street to em-
ploy its surplus capital. The banks accomplished this by a practice
known as \"renting out the balance sheet\"--literally, transferring their
e\177orn\177ous borrowing power to hedge funds with lesser credit ratings,
a servicefor which they charged mere pe\177mies on every $Joo of
credit. Long-Terns w, hich was easily the Street's biggest hedge fu\177d
customer, was reputed to be throwing off $\177oo million to Szoo mil-
lion in fees to Wall Street eachyear,and each of the banks wanted as
big a share of the money as possible \. 177\"Banks were tripping over
then\177selves to n\177ake twenty basis points I\177\"/\17o7f,,\17a7, percentl\"--a trifle
givet\177 the implied risks, noted John Succo, then a trading manager at
Lehman Brothers.
As many as fifty-five banks were giving Long-Term financing.
Dazzled by the partners' air of infallibility, the banks raced to top
o\177)eanother's offers. \"People were lending them money at HBOR la
private-sector bank ratel plus fifty basis points when it should have
been LIBORplus two hundred points,\" said Andrew Sicilian(), the
bond manager at the Basel-basedSwiss Bank, which specialized in de-
rivative trading. Siciliano worried that the Greenwich fund was get-
ting the better of Swiss Bank. The firm squeezed every counterparty
to the max.
Long-Term deftly exploited the banks' hunger for fees, pushing
them to do business on the most advantageous of terms. The fund
traded on razor-thin margins, cutting out the normal profit the banks
could expect from servicing such a behemoth. But the banks didn't
stop dreaming that Long-Term would deliver them a profit at the end
of the rainbow; like frustrated but hopeful parents, they kept favor-
ing their incorrigible child with treats. Merrill Lynch and Salomon
Brothers were Long-Term'sbiggestsugardaddies, at least in terms of
financing. Salomon counted Long-Term as its biggest customer, espe-
cially in European swaps\177 \177but the two firms' intertwined histories
kept them at a wary distance.
Merrill Lynch, on the other hand, was increasingly eagerto nuzzle
up to Long-Term. And the hedge fund was happy to reciprocate--on

its own terms. J.M. quickly befriended Daniel Tully, the Merrill
Lynch chairman, and the Tullys and Meriwethersbecame a foursome.
J.M. even made Tully a partner in Waterville, J.M.'s golf course in
County Kerry, Ireland. To Tully, who was so devoted to his ancestral
homeland that he signed his name in green, this cemented an already
fast business alliance. Underlings at Merrill quickly grasped that the
chairman considered Long-Term to be a special client. \"It was in-
cumbent not just on the salesperson but on the entire organization to
getJ. bM ehin. d also thenuzzrleedlationshuipp,\"to KoTmulalnysksytressaendd.\"Herb Allison, who were
waiting in the wings to take the reins from Tully. Always comfortable
in betting fraternities, J.M. took the Merrill bosses to Belmont, a
racetrack where he boarded horses. Typically, J.M. asked a lot of
questions and let his guests do the talking, and Allison noticed that
he remembered the answers--even little things, such as the name of
Allison's wife--just as he remembered trades. J.M. was always a
good listener. In such a sharp-elbowed business, he stuck out as es-
sentially decent. \"You couldn't help but like him,\" Allison thought.'\"
The high point of Long-Term's seduction of Merrill was an annual
three-day golf competitionat Watervillc, an internationally renowned
course that had been host to, among others, Tiger Woods. About a
dozen attended from each firm, with the Merrill executives escorting
some of the Long-Term partners in private jets, though each company
paid its own way. Waterville was an enchanting place, carved from
lush natural grasses, adjacent to a quaint seaside Irish village. Invita-
tions to the elite affair, held each September,were hot items at Mer-
rill, which printed \"Waterville International Cup\" shirts bearing
checkerboards in green, white, and orange, the Irish colors. In their
off-hours the golfers fished and feasted on sumptuous dinners; then
they retired to an intimate bed-and-breakfast. Early risers enjoyed the
solitary splendor of lofting drives into the ocean at dawn.
For Meriwether, Waterville symbolized the distance he had come
from caddying at Flossmoor. He was an animated host, thriving on
the competition and taking note of every shot, but not neglecting to
give Allison pointers on his release. Led by J.M., a four-handicap
player, Long-Term won the Waterville Cup year after year, prompting
the bankers to whistle at Long-Term'scompetitivespirit. The Merrill
team was impressed with the arbitrageurs, who golfed with as much
\177lan as they traded. Daniel Napoli, Merrill'srisk manager, quipped,



==================================================

==================================================

\"If they could have earnedaPh.D. at golf, they would have.\" Stephen
Bellotti, who ran foreign currency trading at Merrill, turned to
Myron Scholes at one of these weekends and playfully demanded,
\"Myron, what do you have more of\177money or brains?\" Scholes shot
back: \"Brains, but it's getting close!\"
As the business relationship grew closer,Long-Term began to push
Merrill Lynch for more financing. I.eahy, who managed the relation-
ship for Long-Term, would say, \"If you want us to trade, you got to
give usmorebalance sheet.\" Gradually, Merrill opened the spigot. By
,998, it was providing $6.5 billion of repo financing (roughly equal
to Merrill'stotal equity) and proportionately more on the derivative
side. But aside from pleasant weekends in Ireland, it wasn't clear
what Merrill was getting in return. Long-Term simply shaved too
much from the bid and asked prices to leave a normal profit for its
broker. The broker might squawk, but Long-Term wouldn't budge.
At one point, citing Merrill's groxving exposure to the high-risk
hedge fund, a person on Merrill'srepodesk refused to approve more
credit. But shortly before the firms' next golf weekend,the repo man
heard from an anxious salesman: \"I'm going to see Dick Leahy! We
don't want to be embarrassed. How about putting on another five
hundred million dollars?\" When the repo man resisted, the salesman
added, \"You gotta do these trades, or welose the business.\"
Merrill salesmen, eager to promote their prize account, rational-
ized that financing Long-Term was the keyto being able to trade with
the firm and that trading would enable Merrill to see Long-Term's
order flow. Of course, since Merrill saw only one side of each trade,
the information was of dubious value. The usually healthy tension
between the financing and sales desks was tilted in Long-Term's
favor, because people at Merrill knew the account was \"special.\"
Long-Term felt free to tap friends at every level of the firm and
did so. This started with Tully, the chairman, a former broker who
was \"damn proud\" that Merrill had won so much of Long-Term's
business. Even Allison, whom some derided as a hard-edged bean
counter, got caught up in Long-Term's glamour and urged his
underlings to expand the relationship. \"Everybody was enamored
with their intellect,\" Dunleavy, the salesman, recalled. \"It was like
Kennedy's inner circle--Camelot! They had the best and the bright-
est.\"
However, the Merrill executives eventually grew uneasy--not be-
cause\" of I,ong-Term's leverage, but because Merrill was making only

==================================================

$25million ayearoff the account, peanuts considering the two firms'
levelofbusiness T. he financing desk began to fight back: Since Mer-
rill's balance sheet was a precious resource, why squander it on a
chintzy client?
Allison, who was in charge of Merrill'sbusiness with big institu-
tions, including Long-Term, finally took J.M. aside, suggesting iron-
ically that it might be nice for Merrill to make a little money on its
trades, too. Like others who dealt with Long-Term, Allison felt that
the partners analyzed every deal in terms of the profit and lossondis-
crete trades rather than in terms of the overall relationship. And he
said as much to Meriwether.
J.M.replied sympathetically, but Long-Term kept squeezing Mer-
rill all the same. The firm seemed willfully tone-deaf, even at the risk
of souring key alliances.One time, it took advantage of a technical
loophole in a loan document to make $7 million at Merrill's expense.
When an executiveprotested,J.M. frowned and said, \"I didn't real-
ize.\" But he didn't backdown.
\"Hewas sincere,\" the Merrill executive said. \"It was how he
looked at the world: someonewins, someone loses.\"
Insultingly, the partners refusedto trust Merrill with the firm's se-
crets but expected to get big slugs of Merrill I.ynch bond underwrit-
ings, a plum that investment banks reserve for the choicest clients.
Even more galling, Long-Term tried to sell Merrill on an unusual
warrant that had been concocted by Myron Scholes. The warrant
would have been a cheap way for the partners to bet more money on
their own fund--while exposing Merrill to serious risk. Merrill
quickly refused. By now, the famous bull was growing restless. Mer-
rill began to take back someof its balance sheet, though it remained
oneof
Long-Term's biggest bankers.
Merrill was dying to clear Long-Term's trades, but l\177ong-Term re-
fused, because it got this service from BearStearns, where J.M. had a
friend, Vincent Mattone, who had formerly been with Salomon.
Clearing brokers perform many vital functions, such as record keep-
ing and settling trades. Though clearing is usually a lucrative busi-
ness, Bearhad agreed to give Long-Term attractive terms because it,
too, hoped to get more of Long-Term's trading business. Bear also
lent money to six or sevenof the partners so they could raise their
personal investments in the fund. However, Long-Term quickly dis-
covered that Bear could not be pushed around.
For one thing, Bear refused to do much financing on Long-Term's

usual no-haircut basis.The street-savvy Bear had once turned down
a similar request from a Prince of Liechtenstein who was eager to
trade foreign currencies, and it wasn't about to relax the rules for a
hedge fund. \"Our decisionwas very clear,\" one executive recalled.
\"We don't do business without initial margin.\" What's more, Bear
was wary about risking too much of its capital on Long-Term. The
most important clearing function is providing intraday credit. For
Long-Term, which might do hundreds of trades in a day, Bear in ef-
fect actedas a bank, holding many of Long-Term'sassets and paying
and receiving monies on Long-Term'sbehalf to and from counter-
parties around the world.
Without a clearing broker, Long-Term would not have been able
to operate--at least not with anything like its customary flexibility or
speed. Moreover, a prime broker typically has the right to stop clear-
ing without notice, and it is difficult to get a new clearing broker in
a hurry. Therefore, Long-Term was dependent on Bear Stearns to a
greaterextent than on any other firm. And for a Wall Street broker-
age, Bear was an unconventional place. Alan Greenberg, the nearly
septuagenarian chairman, despised the bureaucratic airs of the Mor-
gans and the Merrills. He still sat on the trading floor and answered
his phone with a gruff hello. He was famous for exhorting employ-
ees not to waste paper clips. Greenberg's partner, James Cayne, the
chief executive,had made his name by daring to make a market in
New York City bonds in the difficult \17797os, when a young J.M. had
been pursuing a similar strategy. Under Greenberg'sand Cayne's un-
flinching management, Bear was informal, pragmatic, and relent-
lessly focused on its own self-interest.This worried Long-Term.
In 1994, as Long-Termwas getting off the ground, Askin Capital,
the hedge fund that had suffered crushing losses in the mortgagemar-
ket, had collapsed after Bearhad issueda margin call. The realization
that Bear held all the cards had been gnawing at Long-Term ever
since. In z996, the partners began to agitate for a change.
What Long-Term wanted was acontractual promise from Bear that
it would continue to clearl.ong-Term'strades, even if the hedge fund
encountered seriousproblems. But the broker was worried about its
own security. If Bear continued to clear a fund down to \"dollar zero,\"
it could be forced to makegood on eleventh-hour desperation trades
should the fund eventually collapse. In short, Long-Termand Bear
were each worried about the other's ability to do it harm.

Over many meetings, the two sidescame to a rough agreement.
Basically, Bearwas willing to promise to keep clearingforLong-Term
as long as the hedge fund kept $\177.5 billion on call at Bear.Though
this was acceptable to Long-Term, the partners wanted to resolve
someotherissues before they signed; chiefly, and with uncanny pre-
science, they were anxious to protect Long-Term' fs lexibility during a
crisis. Hilibrand, having read reports of the Askin debacle, realized
that if Long-Term ever did stumble, Bear would be able to force aliq-
uidation, perhaps at fire-sale prices. Bear would also be in a position
to divulge Long-Term's positions, potentially setting off a wave of
selling. Thus, Hilibrand wanted to nail down Long-Term's right to
hold Bearliable for any abuses, such as breaching Long-Term'scon b
fidentiality.
In typical Hilibrand style, he relentlessly hammered away at Bear.
Michael Alix, a seniorcredit executive at Bear, thought Hilibrand ex-
tremely difficult and a trifle paranoid, though some of his concerns
would turn out to have merit.The winsome Eric Rosenfeld, who also
took part in the talks, seemed able to seeBear's point of view; Hili-
brand couldn't. The discussion ws ere like a legal case in which
Hilibrand never ran out of arguments. The parties negotiated in
mounting frustration, but nothing \177vas signed. Hilibrand was push-
ing the much-sought-after clearing agreement out of sight.
The failure to secure an agreement with Bear was apersistentcon-
cern, and JM regularly revisited the matter. Just as Long-Term mas-
saged its relationship with Merrill over golfing weekends, JM and
some of \"the boys\" regularly played poker with Cayne and his col-
league, Vinny Mattone, either at Long-Term's offices in Greenwich or
at Cayne's Park Avenue apartment. The witty, wry Rosenfeld would
have Caync in stitches, but when JM would pipe up \"Jimmy, you got
to do something about the clearancc agreement,\" Cayne would un-
flinchingly reply, \"'No--you gotta.\"
Long-Termwasalso pressing Chase Manhattan. The fund seemedto
want to draw all of Wall Street into its web, and the partners were
shrewd enough to realize that thc time to line up banks was now,
when results were good. Chase had declined to become a counter-
party in \179794, feeling that Long-Term was too new. But when J.M.
returned in i996 , the reception was warmer.J.M. had a contact at

==================================================

88 \225WHEN GENIUS FAILED
Chase, too: David Pflug, the portly head of global credit, who han-
dled loans to clients on Wall Street. The suspendered, blunt-spoken
Pflug (pronounced \"Fluge\") had advised.I.M. during the Mozer cri-
sis, when he had convinced the beleaguered Salomon Brothers to
arrange for emergency credit. Now, in 1996 , Pflug agreed to finance
Long-Term on interest rate swaps--in which, typically, one side
agrees to pay the other a fixed rate of interest in return for receiving
a rate that floats with the market. Chase alsobacked Long-Term on
yield-curve trades--again, a standard sonata in the fixed-income
trader's repertoire, l\177ong-Term deepened its new alliance by selling
Chase a $zo million investment in the fund.
But what Long-Term really wanted was a partner--a bank that
would give it cash on demand when special needs (or even emergency
needs)arose. In the partners' endless negotiations with Merrill, Bear,
and now Chase, they seemed to be looking for a firm that would sup-
port them as resolutelyas Salomon had. Pflug was sympathetic and
arranged for a $5oo million revolving loan from a large syndicateof
banks--in other words, a standby facility that Long-Term could tap
as needed. The bank syndicate demonstrated unusual faith in the
hedge fund by agreeing to fund the revolver without the fund's hav-
ing to put up any collateral.
Then, with the revolver in its pocket, Long-Term turned up the
heat on Chase. Various of the partners began to push the bank to sell
them a peculiar warrant. Of course, this was the same warrant they
had sought, without success, from Merrill. A warrant is an option;
the partners wanted a warrant on their own fund to add a layer of
personal leverage to the enormous leverage already in the portfolio.
Even though they had virtually all of their personal assets in the fund,
the partners, especially Hilibrand, werehot formoreexposure. They
suffered from a curious blind spot; though they fought like tigers for
aclearing agreement that would protect them during acrisis, when it
came to investing their own capital, they seemed not to consider the
possibility of
failing.
The warrant would have exposedChase to untenable risks. Under
Scholes's plan, the partners would pay the bank about $ \1757 million a
year, giveortake, depending on interest rates. In return, Chase would
pay the partners whatever they would have earned on a $zoo million
slice of the fund. For relative peanuts, Chase would be committing to
a huge potential liability if the fund continued to skyrocket. In the-

==================================================

TUG-OF-WAR \22589
ory, Chase could hedge its risk by buying some of the fund for itself.
Then, if the value of the fund rose, Chase would make a profit on its
investment.
But what if the fund fell? According to options theory, which Met-
ton and Scholeshad ofcourse devised, as the value of the fund de-
creased, Chase would need less of a hedge. In other words, if
Long-Term fell, Chase would want to gradually sell assets that mim-
icked those in the fund.
But that would not be so easy, because Long-Term'sassets were
cret. And the partners pointedly refused to disclose them. Pflug was
stunned by Long-Term's arrogance: the partners wanted Chase to
shoulder all of the risks in this dubious deal without divulging what
the risks were. \"How the hell are we supposed to hedge it?,\" Pflug
wondered. The head ofChase's hedge fund practice was skeptical as
well.
But Long-Term would not give up on the warrant. It was rich with
tax swceteners\177always alluring to Hilibrand\177because the partners
could claim any profits from the warrant ascapital gains and defer
them until the warrant expired. Thc concoction wasScholes' fs inest
hour\177an option that would leverage the partners' interest at the ex-
pense
of Uncle Sam.
I,ong-Term pitched the warra\177t scheme all over the bank; J.M.
even took it to Walter Shipley, Chase's chiefexecutive. Hilibrand fi-
nally offered to dispatch Scholesto give the bank a lesson on option
pricing, but Pflug was too smarttogo head-to-head with the guy who
had invented the formula. \"You can overintellectualize these Greek
letters,\" Pflug reflected, referring to the alphas, betas, and gammas in
the option trader's argot. \"One(;reek word that ought to be in there
is hubris.\"
What hubris did Pflug divine? The partners were \177ot arrogant in
their mannerisms or even in their speech; it was more deep-seated. It
was the arrogance of peoplewho had been to Harvard and MI]\177of
people who really believed that they were more intelligent than oth-
ers. \"Do you know why we make so much money?\" Greg Hawkins
once asked an old friend from Salomon. \"It's because we're smarter.\"
Once the Hawk even tried to lecture a colleague's wife about molec-
ular biology, her longtime specialty. \"You're full of shit,\" she finally
replied.

90 \225WHEN GENIUS FAILED
By i996 , Long-Termhad grown to well over a hundred employees
and the partners were building immense fortunes. All along, they had
been deferring the 25 percent of the outside investors' profits that
they took as fees, thus leaving the money in the fund, where, un-
touched by the tax man, it could compound all the faster. As their
third year drew to aclose, the partners collectively had a stake in the
fund of $ \17.47 billion, nine times their initial $150 million investment.
It was an incredible fortune to have made in so little time--and all
from bond spreads! The parmers' nervy decision to keep redoubling
their bets had vaulted them into the ranks of the superrich overnight.
Unlike corporate titans, who hedged their bets by continually peeling
off shares,J.M., Hilibrand, Rosenfeld, and the rest left every nickel
on the table. When they needed spending money, they simply re-
deemed a bit ofthe fund, which they treated like a personalchecking
account.
By the standards of Wall Street moguls, most of the partners were
not lavish spenders, and they frowned on ostentation. Theykidded
the free-spending Hawkins for flying in decorators to his country
home in Saratoga, near the track where Hawkins kept thorough-
breds. When Hawk suggested they buy a company jet, the others
wouldn't hear of it. But each of them had their moments. J.M. had
his horsesand memberships in three tony golf clubs--Winged Foot
and Shinnecock in New York State and Cypress Point in California--
in addition to Waterville.\" He also had a taste for pricey automobiles,
including a Ferrari Testa Rossa. Rosenfeld,who lived in a spacious
waterfront home in Westchester, indulged a passion for wine.He had
a photographic memory for vintages and stocked his ten-thousand-
bottle cellar directly from France. As if to add a twinkle to his soft-
spoken demeanor, the former professor scarcely went visiting without
toting along one of his cherished Clos de Vougeots or other choice
Burgundies. For Hilibrand, the money meant added seclusion. He
bought a fifteen-acre,Sz.i million plot in a wooded private commu-
nity in Greenwich and was spending $4 million to build a lavish
thirty-thousand-square-foot house.\" But even such indulgences could
hardly make a dent in the partners' bank accounts. The pursuit of
money may have beencentral to their lives, but as is often the case,
it went far beyond any conceivable lifestyle needs. The money was a
scorecard, a proof of their superlative trading skills. For Merton and
Scholes, it added a worldly validation to their academic successes.

Fights over shares were common;as at Salomon Brothers, com-
pensation was the natural turf for venting internal tensions. The ca-
sual air at Steamboat Road was deceptive, for it masked latent
tensions that emerged every timeissues of control, shares, or big port-
foliomoves surfaced. The fiery Scholes, who was eager to edge his
way up the ladder, was prickly with Mullins, each academic thinking
he was smarter than the other. Hawkins, an easygoing southerner,
deeply resented the secretive, domineering Hilibrand. Even Rosen-
reid, who was in charge of operational details, came under subtle
pressure from Meriwether, who \177vould periodically grouse, \"Eric has
got to find a way to make some money,\" as if running the firm wasn't
enough.
The arbitrageurs were blind to the value of contributions that
didn't drop straight to the bottom line; only financial points counted.
Perhaps this was one reason they were so intent, well after they had
any need, on maximizing their personal net worths. They simply
wouldn't give up on Scholes's \177varrant idea, the main point of which
was to leverage their personal fortunes. And the warra\177t became an
obsession with them.
Just as the partners had browb\177'aten Merrill, Bear, and Chase, they
began to lobby Union Bank of Switzerland for the warrant. It was a
curious choice, becauseUBShad already snubbed Long-Term twice.
UBS had declinedto invest in the hedge fund in \177994, when the fund
was taking off. A little later, J.M. and Haghani had gone calling
again, hoping to enlist UBS for bond and swap trading. But UBS
feared the leverage in such trades and once again declined.
However, Long-Term continued to press the Zurich-based bank.
What's more, the hedge fund had a key ally within UBS, a Brooklyn
native and former Salomon salesman named Ron Ta\177mcnbaum. Af-
fable and rugged-looking, Ta\177mc'nbaum had joined Salomon in New
York a year after Hilibrand. fie had L\177t\242m'row'd to 'lk\177kyo, where he
had been a sort of local distributio\177 agc\177t for the Arbitrage Group.
Thenhehad transferred to l,ondon, where' he' had seen a lot ofMeri-
wether. At first, Tannenbaum had bc'c'\177 intimidated by J.M. and
probably awed by J.M.'s traders. But over the years, Tannenbaum be-
came the group's friend and steadfast admirer.
At UBS, Tannenbaum covered hedge funds. He kept urging his
bossesto give the boys from (;reenwich a chance. Meanwhile, the
bank was going through unsettling changes. Long the premier bank

in Switzerland, UBS had epitomized the country's tradition-bound
banking establishment. Steeped in Swiss culture, it recruited gnome-
like bankers from the national army rather than from MIT and
offered each vice president a choice of three polished woods--
mahogany, walnut, or pine--to panel his office with. '\177The compla-
cent bank had been startled to discover that international finance no
longer moved at such a leisurely, Alpine pace. It had been shocked
when Swiss Bank, a rival much quicker to modernizeand, in partic-
ular, to embrace derivatives, had overtaken UBS. By the mid-\177 99os,
UBS had begun to fight back, hiring a slew of aggressivetraders.
Mathis Cabiallavetta, a debonair prince of Swiss banking who had
risen to chiefexecutive, gave his gunslinger traders free rein in a des-
perate bid to regain UBS'sperch at the top. With the bank eager to
grow, in September \177t995, Tannenbaum persuaded the board to ap-
prove Long-Term as a counterparty. The bank also hired a
Malaysian-born trader from Merrill, T. J. Lim, and gave him march-
ing orders to gin up its derivative business. Thus, by i996 , the stage
was setfor Long-Term to finally gain a foothold in the Alps.
Overnight, the hedge fund became UBS's biggest account, netting
the bank $\1775 million in revenue in its first year.\" But asalways with
Long-Term, the business was low margin--typically half of \17p7ercent.
On one trade inw\177lving Japanese equities, Long-Term shaved the mar-
gin to 22.5 basis points, less than one quarter of a percent. Ramy
Goldstein,UBS's freewheeling head of equity derivatives, took the low-
margin trade under protest. \"Ronnie, they're not customers, they're
competitors!,\"Goldstein, a silver-haired former Israeli paratrooper
with a doctorate from Yale University; exclaimed to Tannenbaum.
\"I\177ose my number,\" he added. \"I don't want to do moreLTCMdeals!\"
But UBS's LTCM deals had only begun. With controls at UBS
growing ever looser, the bank began to swing for the fences. In fact,
the charismatic Goldstein, who had a cowboy's thirst for adventure,
led the way, pursuing a raft of risky stock-option trades. Meanwhile,
Tannenbaum beganto think about elevating the Long-Term relation-
ship to higher-margin products. UBSstarted assisting Long-Termon
tax-relatedproposals, which reunited Tannenbaum with a good
friend from his Salomon days: Myron Scholes.
With Long-Term showing such sexy profits, UBSwas regretting its
earlier failure to invest. \"God, that's the biggest mistake we ever
made,\"moaned Hans-Peter Bauer, head of fixed-income, currency,,
and derivatives, who had rejectedLong-Term before. Long-Term had

stopped taking new money, so the window for investors apparently
was closed. Indeed, wealthy Swiss were paying xo percent premiums
to buy out old investors. But in July \177996, knowing that Tannem
baum was tight with the boys from Greenwich.Bauerasked the sales-
man to see if his friends might, perchance, let the bank invest.
Long-Term was now getting very interested in UBS,and turned the
charm on in its eager salesman. The fund broke with its no-new-
money stance and offered Tannenbaum a sliceof the fund for him-
self, personally, though UBS wouldn't let him accept it. At the time,
Long-Term was thinking of forming a splinter fund--LTCM-X, it
was dubbed--to invest in especially high risk trades and alsoto focus
on Latin America. The frustrated ScholessawLTCM-Xas a way to
get out from under Hilibrand's control, which he increasingly re-
sented. With LTCM-X in mind, the firm offered a partnership to
Roberto Mendoza, a Harvard-educated vice chairman at J. P.Mor-
gan and the son of a former Cuban ambassador to Great Britain.
With these plans percolating along, Scholes dangled before Tannen-
baum the prospect of working for LTCM-X--presumably part of an
effort to ingratiate Long-Term with Tannenbaum's employer. In Oc-
tober, Scholes offered the ultimate carrot, telling Tanncnbaum that
the fund would agree to let UBSmake a large investment in the
fund--if the bank alsoagreed to write a warrant on the fund for the
Long-Term partners.
In the fall, Cabiallavetta, the bank chairman, and Goldsteinpaid a
call on the partners in Greenwich. By now, the UBSbrass, though
eager to cement the tie to Long-Term,had started to worry that Tan-
nenbaum might be getting a little too close to his account. \"We aren't
sure if Ronnie is our man or yours,\" one of them said. J.M. brushed
off their concern, saying, \"Ron's a good man.\"
The partners treated Cabiallavetta like a long-lost cousin. Almost
all the partners attended the meeting,except for Merton, who was at
Harvard, and Haghani, who, though m from London, was dashing
in and out of J.M.'s office to handle some emergency. When Cabi-
allavetta asked about the outlook \177or European monetary integra-
tion, J.M. had Mullins give a little lecture, which impressed the Swiss.
Only Long-Term had a resident central banker, l\177ittle was said at the
meetingabout the warrant, but Tannenbaum spent November writ-
ing a proposal to show to his superiors. The basic pitch was right out
of the Black4choles model. The key determinant in the option-
pricing formula is volatility. And Long-Termhad been exceptionally

steady. In fact, 1996 had been its steadiest year yet. Thus, a Black-
Scholes trader would be willing to write a call option on the fund for
a relatively small premium. Sportingly, Scholes had offered a pre-
mium that was somewhat higher. In other words, under the assump-
tion that Long-Term's results would remain stead>UBScouldbook
an immediate $z 5 million profit. Goldstein wasaghast. \"Ronnie, we
could lose multiples of that!\" he protested. The deal hinged on the
Achilles' heel ofBlack-Scholes the: assumption that volatility isacon-
stant. If I,ong-Term should encounter a skittish patch over the war-
rant's seven-yearlife,UBScould face a massive loss.
Tannenbaum wrote a convincing sales report.He portrayed the
benefits of the warrant largely in relational terms, citing what
UBS would gain from being Long-Term's partner, from seeing its
trading flow, and so forth. \"The Principals of LTCM will help accel-
erate UBS' learning process in portfolio management, risk manage-
ment, and dynamic capital allocation,\" the salesman wrote.
Presuming Tannenbaum believed that, he was the only one left on
Wall Street who did. But then, he had nourished a wish to bepart of
the Long-Term gang for a decade. Hewas still fond of recalling how
he had started out with Hilibrand, \"the biggest brain in the busi-
ness.\" Of course, Tannenbaum was only a salesman and scarcelyhad
authority to approve major deals. Salesmen often become close to the
clients they cover; that is why ultimate responsibility rests with
higher-ups. But by year-end, although nothing had been signed,Sc-
holes's warrant was getting a hearing from UBSsenior traders and
managers.
The fund earned 57percent in \179796 (4 \177percent after the partners'
fees) thanks to leveraged spread trades on Japaneseconvertibles, junk
bonds, interest rate swaps, and--again--Italian bonds. Also, when
French bonds began to trade above German bonds (implying, curi-
ously, that France boreless inflation risk than Germany), the partners
cleverly, and successfully, bet on Germany to make a relativecome-
back. Their total profits in \177996 were an astounding $z.; billion. '\177

lysts, and researchers, unknown to the general public and employed

And they had done it with stunningly little volatility. Not once in
1996 did Long-Term suffer a monthly loss of \177percent./\" To Hill-
brand, Haghani, and Hawkins, the results proved convincingly that
diversification worked. The fund's diversetrades were blending with
symphonic perfection, like the independent dice or the random cards
from a model by Merton. '\177\"We can't get the risk [read: volatility]
high enough,\" the traders told a friend, as if awed by their own doc-
trine. \"We're seeing the power of diversification.\"
Only Meriwether, who had lived through more ups and downs
than his partners, was circumspect. At a year-end luncheon in
London, Costas Kaplanis, one of J.M2sold traders from Salomon
Brothers, tipped his hat to Long-Terrors spectacular first three years,
but J.M. refused to accept congratulations. He humbly replied that
onewould need at least six years of results to say for sure that Long-
Term's formula was working. Perhapshesensed that the partners had
enjoyed some luck--an unusual stretch of balmy weather. As if to
batten down the hatches, Long-Termasked its investors--now about
a hundred in number--to agree to stagger the dates on which they
could take out money m the future. People who did not agree could
take their money home (none did).This gaw\" Long-Term added pro-
tection should its investors ever want to withdraw cn masse.
In fact, money was pouring into the arbitrage business via rival
banks and competitor funds--an added reason for J.M.'s dour mood.
This new money, he knew, was forcing spreads tighter--indeed, it
was one reason for Long-Term'srecent profits. But it would make
new opportunities tougher to find.
Writing to investors just before the year closed, J.M. was the model
of prudence. Long-Term's results reflected \"greater than expected
convergence in a number of important strategies,\" he noted. As a re-
suit, \"i996 net returns to date have substantially exceeded the expec-
tations of the Management Company asol the beginning of the year.\"
This did not augur well. Sincespreads on l.ong-Term's existing
trades had already narrowed, such trades offered less potential for
profit in the future. Moreover, the fund had not been able to find new
trades quickly enough to keep pace with the growth in its capital.
Rather humbly, J.M. all but predicted that the rocket would return to
earth: \"Ourcurrent, but necessarily imprecise, judgment is that the
net return for t997 is likely to be materially below the \177996 return,
although actual results may beconsiderably above or below our ex-
pectations including potential for loss.\" '\177

vestment bank on Wall Street had, to some degree,gotten into the
game. Most had separatearbitrage desks, with traders specifically as-
signed to lookforopportunities in every nook and cranny of the busi-
ness. Lured by the scent of the fantastic profits being earned in
Greenwich,'other banks were reaching for the same nickels as Long-
Term. Inevitably, they whittled away the very spreads that had at-
tracted them; thus do free markets punish success.Long-Term had
always been dogged by imitators, but now the imitators were piling
on faster than ever.No sooner did a spread open up than rival traders
plugged it. \"Everyone else was catching up to us,\" Rosenfeld com-
plained. \"We'd go to put on a trade, but when we started to nibble,
the opportunity would vanish.\"'
Characteristically, Meriwetherencouraged the firm to explore new
territory. Even at Salomon, the troops had always sought to extend
their turf. Hadn't they moved from swapspreads to mortgage-backed
securities? Hadn't they branched into junk bonds and European
debt? In retrospect, such moves had been baby steps, not bold new

departures. But the partners' experience--to them, at least--seemed
to belie the adage that it is dangerous to try to transport success to
unfamiliar ground. Trusting their models, they simply rebooted their
computers in virgin terrain.
By 1997, the plans for the high-risk splinter company, I.TCM-X,
had faded. (Mendoza, the Morgan official, had decided not to accept
kong-Tcrm's ofl:er of a partnership.) Instead, the partners were toying
with ways ofbroadening the mother fund, even of going beyondpub-
licmarkets. From Long-Term's point of view, the trouble with the se-
curities business was its inherent accessibility. Anybody conld buy a
bond or mimic someone who did. The partners' reclusive style ill
fitted the rough democracy of markets. They were increasingly
intrigued with the idea of making less liquid, more permanent in-
vestments in financial businesses, beyondthereach of hated copycats.
Merton was exploring a joint venture with Banca Nazionalc del
Lavoro, an Italian bank with a big money management operation, to
peddle mutual funds to retail investors. The idea was to combine
BNL's institutional clout with Long-Term's academic pedigree and
offer a product to the everyday signore. Merton, with his naive belief
in perfect markets, was pushing the notion of \"optimum portfolios\"
for the little man. Giovannmi, l.ong-I\177'rm'sresident Italian, was dep-
utized to coordinate the effort, and Gennotte was dispatched to
Rome, where he took up temporary residence to work out details
with BNL. Meanwhile, .|. P. Morgan \177vasurging Long-Term to diver-
sify further. Morgan executives felt that the partners should \"lever-
age\" their intellect--in effect, apply their brains and methodology to
businessesoutside the normal scope of hedge funds. Quietly, the part-
ners beganto explore setting up an insurance operation.
While such grand ventures were progressing slowly, Long--Term
was under immediate pressure to park its capital s\177;;;;eu,here. By
\177997, it had more than $5 billion in cqnity. If l.ong Term was to sus-
tain its splendid rate of return, that capital would have to beinvested.
But Long-Term's computers were failing to fred opportunities. In one
new foray, Long-Term boldly crashed the market for securities
backed by commercial mortgages--wholly different from the market
for IOs and POs, which, of course, were backed by familiar home
mortgages. Long-Term's appetite was so stunningly large that it
transformed the commercial market, which soared from $3 \260billion
of new issues a year to $60 billion almost overnight. Hilibrand made

no pretense of having expertise in commercial real estate;predictably,
he felt the firm could find an edge in financing. \"They could earn the
carry [the spread] with very little risk,\" a mortgage banker recalled.
\"The spread was thin, but Long-Termhad a huge ability to leverage.\"
This was the firm's standard formula; the partners were determined
to drag their cookie cutter wherever they could.
But commercial mortgages were relatively small potatoes. Equi-
ties-that is, traded stocks--loomed as a far larger and more tanta-
lizing new frontier, tt was an open frontier because most traders with
Long-Term's mathematical benthad naturally left equities alone. Al-
though pricing a bond can largely be reduced to math, valuing a
stock is far more subjective. Wall Street (and academe) had devised
many a formula to forecast the market, but none, no matter how es-
oteric or rigorous, had worked. Over the short run, stocks are sub-
ject to the whim of often emotional traders. Over the long run, they
vary with business performance, which issubjectto great uncertainty
and is notoriously hard to forecast. It requires judgment--not merely
math--of the sort that no computer has evermastered. As the econ-
omist Burton Malkielonceobserved, \"God Almighty does not know
the proper price-earning multiple for a common stock.\"-\" But Long-
Term Capital did know--or at least, it boldly reckoned that it could
transport its models to equities.
Haghani had been researching equities, particularly in Europe, and
he thought the field was ripe for a firm with the necessary quantita-
tive skills but--importantly--without the need to get enmeshed in the
messy details of specific-stock analysis. Rosenfeld, too, had been
thinking about equity arbitrage since his days at Salomon. One at-
tractive point was that equity arbitrage would (he supposed) be
correlated with bond arbitrage. Ever Merton's disciple, Rosenfeld
wanted random investment dice, and it was hard to imagine that the
spreads between stocks would widen at the same moment as the
spreads between mortgages or the spreads between European bonds)
Equities seemed of a different world. By definition, this would not be
a small extension of the business but a radical, risky experiment.
Haghani focused his research on so-calledpairedshares. Various
European stocks were doubly listed. Volkswagen, for instance, listed
an ordinary share and a \"preference\" share, the latter with superior
voting rights. BMW was another. Haghani also looked at pairs of
stocks with related (but not identical) assets, such as TelecomItalia,



==================================================
                     PAGE 108

the Italian phone company,and Telecom Italia Mobile, its subsidiary,
or Louis Vuitton and Dior. For various reasons, oneside of a given
pair often traded ata discount to its partner. Hence, Haghani spotted
the potential for arbitrage. David Modest, yet another MIT-trained
economist, did the modeling on equity trades. But Haghani ran
the show. \"Modestdid what Victor told him,\" one insider noted.
\"Victor said, 'Go short this,' and Modest would work out how to
do
it.\"
The paired-share trades weren't perfectarbitrages,because the two
sides of each trade were never precisely equivalent. A preference
share of Volkswagen was worth a premium over an ordinary share,
especially as, in Germany and elsewhere in Europe, managements did
not feel the sameobligation as in the United States to treat all stock-
holders fairly. No one could say precisely what the \"right\" premium
was, only that the 40 percent premium in VW's case, for example,
seemedexcessive. But the spread could persist or even widen--the
models be damned. Given such uncertainties, most players limited
paired-share trades to moderatesize. But with its coffers burgeoning,
Long-Termwas developing a sense of proportion all its own; like a
man who pays for dinner with hundred-dollar bills and neverasks for
change, it had lost the habit of moderation.
Haghani and Modest found about fifteen paired-share trades, and
Haghani bet on them in staggering size. His favorite was Royal
Dutch/Shell, the huge Anglo-Dutch oil consortium. Royal Dutch/
Shell was owned by two listed companies, Royal Dutch Petroleum of
the Netherlands and ShellTransport of England. Although Royal
Dutch and Shell got their income from the same source--that is, from
dividends on Royal Dutch/Shell--the English firm had historically
traded at an 8 percentorso discount to its Dutch cousin. Thc stocks
were owned by distinct pools of investors,and the l)utch stock was
typically more liquid. But therc was no good reason for the price dif-
ferential. With Europe becoming a single economic unit, Haghani
reckoned that national differences wonld matter less and less, and the
spread between Royal Dutch and Shell would contract. This was a
popular view.
But the size of Haghani's position was stunning. Long-Term bet
Sz. 3 billion--half of it long on Shell, the other half short on Royal
Dutch--without, ofcourse, any assurance that the spread would con-
tract. In practical terms, a position that large was totally illiquid.

==================================================

100 \225WHEN GENIUS FAILED
Contrary to common supposition, there is nothing wrong with
being illiquid--unless you are vulnerable to being forced to sell in a
hurry. But Long-Term, being highly leveraged, was in that very
spot for, as we haveseen, leveraged investors can accumulate losses
with terrifying speed. Ignoring this oft-proven verity, Haghani struck
a gargantuan trade with borrowed money. He was under stressdue
to the ill health of his father, who died later that year, and he felt pres-
sure due to the deteriorating landscape in bond arbitrage. Still, there
is no explaining the size of the Royal Dutch/Shell trade, other than to
accept that Haghani was beginning to believe in his own invincibility.
\"It was ridiculously big,\" said an executiveat a Wall Street bank.
Goldman Sachs had the same trade on. They believed it was a good
trade. But Long-Tcrm's trade was ten times the size of Goldman's.
On the American side of the Atlantic, Hilibrand also was busy in
equities. As early as 1995, Long-Term had started to dabble in
merger arbitrage, also known as \"risk arbitrage,\" or betting that an-
\177ounced acquisitions would actually close. In 1995, when Westing-
house agreedto buy CBS, for example, the priceofCBS vaulted zo
percent, to $78 a share. But that price was still below the deal price
of $8z a share. Thus, anyone who bought CBS after the announce-
ment stood to make a 5percent profit--if the deal closed. Of course,
if the merger fell through, the stock could give back the entire zo per-
cent gain. And many mergers do fall through.
Since any number of events can sabotage a deal, merger arbi-
trageurs have to be canny jacks-of-all-trades--knowledgeable about
the companies, their industries, the financing, antitrust and other reg-
ulatory issues, and the Col\177dition of markets in general. Becauseof the
range of experience required, a small group of specialists does noth-
ing but merger deals. The bestof them are highly selective; their skill
resides in being able to choose the very few deals that aremost likely
to close. Long-Term's approach was altogether different. Since its
professors claimed no expertise in individual stocks--indeed, they as-
sumed that the future course of stockswas random--the fund made
no attempt to pick the winners. It simply bought a market basket,or
virtually every deal stock that it deemed a safe bet.
The partners debated hiring a risk-arbitrage specialist but didn't.
Meanwhile, Hilibrand bought deal stock after deal stock. And he
confidently bought them in very big size, despite the growing dis-
comfort of a half dozen of his partners. Scholesand Merton argued

that merger arbitrage--particularly on such a scale--was excessively
risky for the obvious reason that Long-Term was playing in a field iu
which it had absolutely no expertise. Meriwether and his traders
knew the bond world inside out. In merger arbitrage, J.M. had no
edge;indeed, it was Long-Term's rivals who had the advantage.
Within Long-Term, the debate over merger arbitrage was fierce.
Meriwether ran the debate like a seminar, tolerating all points of
view. In a sense, this was a mistake:J.M. never put his foot down.
After such a long and fruitful partnership, he was disinclined to in-
tervene against his two enfant terrible traders, Hilibrand and
Haghani. J.M.'s personal loyalties weighed on portfolio considera-
tions, a serious flaw in a risk manager.
\"This trade was by far the mostcontroversial in our partnership,\"
Eric Rosenfeld admitted. \"A lot of people felt we shouldn't be in the
risk arb business because it is so information sensitive and weweren't
trying to trade in an information-sensitive way. ''4
The firm would most likely have steered clear of risk arbitrage had
the generally popular Rosenfeld opposed the trade (Meriwether, in
particular, rarely madea decision without consulting his trusted pro-
t\177g\177).However, Rosenfeld, too, tended to side with Hilibrand and
Haghani, and the others finally went along.
Veteran arbs quickly realized that somebody new had entered the
game and that the somebodywas both very big and indiscriminate--
or,asRosenfeld put it, not \"information sensitive.\" By buying in such
volume, Long-Term was boosting deal stocks across the board,
squeezingspreads to unprofitable levels. As usual, Long-Termwas
content to earn relatively tiny spreads because it intended to multiply
its returns with leverage. Still, one marvels at Long-Term's audacity,
sauntering into a corner of Wall Street--(mc in which savvy veterans
had been working for years--and rewriting the ccouomicsof the field
overnight. Long-Term was the gorilla that anm\177m\177ccs the rules wher-
ever it goes.
One night, Hilibrand, J.M., and Mullms hnd dinner with Daniel
Tisch,a prominent risk arbitrageur. Tisch, son of the investor Larry
Tisch, had the impression that I,ong-Tcrm was thinking about the
business solely in mathematical terms. Indeed, Hilibrand expressed
every financial puzzle in terms of a spread. In risk arb, spreads were
roughly 4 percent to \177opercent, much greater than bond spreads.
\"Our business looks very attractive next to their business, where they

trade to makeacouple of basis points,\" Tisch noted. \"The only trou-
ble is, if you're wrong on a government bond the spread may change
by a half a point. If you're wrong on risk arb, you can lose half your
position.\" In short, the reason that deal spreads wereso much wider
than bond spreads was that you could lose a lot more money on
merger arbitrage. Tisch left feeling that Long-Term didn't know what
it was doing. It was both inexperienced and highly leveraged--a po-
tentially explosive combination. Terence Sullivan, the Long-Term in-
vestor from Shaker Heights, heard of its risk-arb involvement
through the grapevine and was shocked that the fund was straying so
far from its ken.
Apart from CBS,Long-Term'sbiggest position was MCI Commu-
nications, which in \177996 agreed to be acquired by British Telecom-
munications. Both CBS and MCI had to clear regulatory thickets, and
each deal dragged on for hmger than expected. In the case ofCBS,
Long-Term continued to snap up shares even when CBS stock had
inched to within 6z cents of the deal price. Long-Term's leverage on
the trade was 2oto t--without its having any specialized knowledge
of the merger. \"You're picking up nickels in front of bulldozers,\" a
friendly money manager warned Rosenfeld, alluding to the risk that
onedealor another would collapse. Eventually the CBSmergerwas
completed, which only emboldened Long-Term to do more such
trades.Its portfolio would grow to thirty deals.

Readers may be excused for wondering how Long-Termcouldbor-
row so much toward the purchase of stocks. The Federal Reserve
Board, under a statutory provision known as \"Regulation T,\" sets a
limit on broker loans for stocks, also known as \"margin.\" For the
past twenty-five years, the Fed has set the maximum margin loan at
50 percent ofthe total investment.
When Long-Term purchased stocks, it of course was subject to
Reg T. But for the most part, Long-Term built its equity positions
without buying actual securities. Rather, the fund entered into deriv-
ative contracts that mimicked the behavior of stocks.If,forinstance,
Long-Term wanted to earn the return on $\177oo million of CBS stock
over a three-year period, it would strike a \"swap\" contract with, say,
Swiss Bank. Long-Term would agree to make a fixed annual pay-
ment, calculated as an interest rate on Stoo million. And Swiss Bank

would agree to pay Long-Term whatever profit would have bcc,/
earned had Long-Term actually purchased the stock. (If the stock fell,
Long-Term would pay Swiss Bank.) Most likely, Swiss Bank would
hedge its risk by buying actual shares. But that was no concern of
Long-Term's.
What mattered to J.M. and company was that they could make a
huge investment in CBS with no money down and without having to
make all of the usual disclosures. And despite Reg T, it was perfectly
legal.TheFed, after all, merely restricted loans toward the purchase
ofstocks. Long-Term wasn't purchasing anything; it was making side
bets on the direction of stocks--which amounted to the same thing.
The Street had been using equity swaps to get around RegT for
about a decade, but in recent years the scale of the business had
soared. Moreover, banks had become increasingly blunt about help-
ing firms skirt the margin rules.Derivatives had not started out this
way; in fact, the premise behind them had been innocuous. Invest-
ment bankers in the late \17797os and early \17798os had had the idea that
simple agreements--contracts, derivatives, call them what you like--
would be a more efficient way of transferring risk than actually buy-
ing and selling assets. For example, ii/ the prederivative era, most
families were stuck with fixed-rate mortgages. Even a homeowner
who would have preferred to roll the dice (i.e., assume a little risk on
future rates) had no practical way to act on his sentiments.The bank
offered him, and everyone else, the same conventional fixed-rate
loan. That was understandable, as the mortgage bank was also pay-
ing a fixed rate for its money. But by using derivatives(a favorite ex-
ample of Merton's) the bank could convert a fixed-rate loan into a
floating-rate one. The genius behind the idea is that, for every cus-
tomer, there is always some other party with the opposite need. Per-
haps a company planned to make annual borrowings for many years
and would prefer the predictability of a fixed rate. If only a family
that had a fixed-rate mortgage,and the compa\177/y, which was facing

they could. (Not that they knew it; ba\177/ks, \177/aturally, acted as inter-
mediaries.)
The first modern swap was engineered in I98 r. IBM had bonds
denominated in Swiss francs and German marksand wanted to con-
vert this debt to dollars. DavidSwensen, a Yale Ph.D. newly arrived
at Salomon, suggested that perhaps some other borrower could be

persuaded to issuedebt that, aside from being denominated in dol-
lars, was identical to IBM's.One obvious choice was the World Bank,
which had an appetite for holding debt in a variety of currencies. As
an inducement to borrow, Salomon gavethe bank a slightly lower-
thanqnarket interest rate. Then the two borrowers switched--IBM
winding up with dollar debt, the World Bank with the foreign stuff--
and voilS! the world of swaps was born.
The businessgrew--at first slowly, then exponentially. Soon,
banks were swapping obligations for currencies, interest rate pay-
ments, equities, any future stream of cash that could be traded for an-
other. In i99o , there were $2 trillion worth of interest rate swaps
(just one type of derivative) outstanding. By \177997, the total had
soared to $22 trillion.\" One offshoot--largely unintended--of this
tremendous growth was that banks' financial statements became in-
creasingly obscure. Derivatives weren't disclosed in any way that was
meaningful to outsiders. And as the volume ofdealsexploded t, he
banks' balance sheets revealed lessand less of their total obligations.
By the mid-,99os , the financial statements of even many midsized
banks were wrapped in an impenetrable haze.
The bankers were too busy making money to bother about the
risks or the shoddy disclosure in this fast-growing business. The few
who did voice caution, such as Henry Kaufman, a noted economist
who worked at Salomon in the \17798os, were ignored. Kaufman re-
called:
1 still remember when Meriwether's group came in and we
started doing interest-rate swaps. There was always a question
of what type of limits we would set. It just kept mounting and
mounting. After we had a billion it went to two billion. Then it
went to five billion. There was never an analytical framework
fl)r saying how far we should go.
By t995, when Meriwether's traders were happily ensconced at
Long-Term, the group had a total derivative book worth $650 bil-
lion. Within two years, the total doubled, to an astounding $\177.25 tril-
lion. Given the opaque nature of Long-Term's (and everyoneelse's)
disclosures, it was impossible to pinpoint the fund's derivative risks
according to specifictrades. And since many of its contracts were
hedges that tended to cancel eachother out, it was impossible to cal-
culateLong-Term's true economic exposure. One could say only that

it appeared to be growing very quickly--as were exposures up and
down Wall Street. Almost imperceptibly, the Street had bought into a
massive faith game, in which each bank had become knitted to its
neighbor through aweb of contractual obligations requiring little or
no down payment.
Regulators became increasingly worried. By the midq99os , Wall
Street had become accustomed to one or two derivative \"shocks\" a
year. Banks or institutions considered healthy one day would go up
in smoke the next due to hidden derivative exposures. One by one,
()range County, Bankers Trust, Barings Bank, Metallgesellschaft,
Sumitomo Corporation, and others revealed sudden and massive
losses. As the list of individual traumas grew, regulators began to fret
about the possibility of a shock to the entire s),stem: pull on the right
thread, and the entire ball of string would unravel, they feared. But
was there such a thread, a firm so intertwined with Wall Street that
its failure could undo the system? Such fears may have been un-
focused, but they were not unreasonable. In the words of Nicholas
Brady, the former Treasury secretary, \"Every time there's been a fire,
these guys [derivative traders] have been around it. TM
As early as the spring of \177994, iust when l.ong-Term was starting
to trade, the New York Fed was becoming uneasy about hedge funds'
easy access to credit, including derivative credit. In April, in a letter
to the CEOsof every bank in the New York region, Chester Feldberg,
executive vice president of the New York Fed, admonished the
bankers not to eschew their historic duty to prudence. \"Credit limits
for customers are an essentialtool for credit risk management,\" Feld-
berg warned.- Following up such concerns, Fed regulators met with
managers at several large New York banks in i997 to discuss the
banks' relationships with hedge funds. '\17T7he Fed examiners urged the
banks to step up their monitoring of hedge fund accounts but, sur-
prisingly, reported that the banks were already improving their su-
pervision.\"
With regard to derivatives, the policy making arm of the Fed took
a laissez-faire approach--starting with (;rcenspan, who was enam-
ored with the seamless artistry of thc m'w financial tools. In public
debates,Greenspan repeatedly ioined forccs with private bankers, led
by Citicorp's John Reed, who were fighting tooth and nail to headoff
proposals for tougher disclosure requirements. Even as hedge funds
increasingly used swaps to dodge the Fed's own margin rules,

==================================================

106 \225WHEN GENIUS FAILED
Greenspan cast an approving eye. Incredibly, rather than trying to ex-
tend some form of margin rule to the derivative world, Greenspan
proposed to eliminate the margin rules entirely. His t995 testimony
to Congress read like a banker's brief. At its heart was a beguilingly
simple idea: that more trading (and hence more lending) was always
and inherently good because it bolstered \"liquidity.\"
Removal of these financing constraints would promote the
safety and soundness of broker-dealers by permitting more fi-
nancing alternatives and hence moreeffective liquidity manage-
ment .... In the case of broker-dealers, the Federal Reserve
Board sees no public policy purpose in it being involved in over-
seeing their securities credit.'\"
A bit of liquidity greases the whecls of markets; \177vhat Greenspan
overlooked is that with too much liquidity-, the market isapt to skid
off the tracks.\" To() much trading encourages speculation, and no
market, no matter how liquid, can accommodate all potential sellers
when the day of reckoning comes. But (;reenspan was hardly the first
to be seduced by the notion that if only we had a little more \"'liquid-
ity,\" we could prevent collapsesforever.
Save for the Fed, the only ones who could restrain derivativelend-
ing were the banks. But Wall Street never polices itself in good times.
The banks' own balancesheets were steadily ballooning; by the late
t99os, Wall Street was leveraged \1775to \177.'-'Awash with liquidity if
not quite drowning in it, the banks had to fred an outlet for their cap-
ital. Themost tempting targets were hedge funds. \"Peoplewere look-
ing at the good sideof the world,\" noted Steve Freidheim, a trader
and hedge fund manager at Bankers Trust. \"I could borrow any
amount Iwanted, and the rates kept coming down. I'd getcalls from
banks saying, 'Hey, we got another fifty million for you--we got a
hundred million!'\" As banks relentlessly chased the fund business,
they silently relaxed their standards, marking down the risk of possi-
ble negative news. By (996, Wall Street was trading $500 billion in
repos and $zoo billion in currency and interest rate swaps every
day. '\177
No borrower had to account for its total exposure; no lender
asked.Each bank knew the extent of its own exposure to an individ-
ual client, in particular to Long-Term.None bothered to think about
whether the hedge fund might be similarly exposed to a dozen other

banks. \"You'd be doing big chunks of business with them,\" recalled
Sicilian(), the manager at Swiss Bank. \"You'd assume you were their
number one provider, but really you were number ten. You couldn't
believe they were doing that much volume.\"
Swiss Bank had a subtle but powerful impact on Long-Term. To(1
sophisticated in derivatives t(1 be easily impressed by the superstars in
Greenwich, its history had paralleled Long-Term's. In 1977, when
commodity traders had begun to apply the options formula that Met-
ton and Scholes had invented, Edward and Willia\177n O'Connor, two
brothers who traded soybeans, had founded a new firm to invest in
options. O'Connor & Associates became one of the savviest of the
new derivatives firms. In t986, the firm hired David Solo, a terse,
precise-spoken electrical engineer from MIT and a brilliant quantita-
tive trader. After the t987 stock market crash, when options traders
suffered massive losses,O'C(lnnor realized it needed deeper pockets.
Citicorp, Bankers Trust, and UBS all had a chance
to acquire
O'Connor but passed. Finally, in \17799\177,Swiss Bank bought it. This
wasabold m(lve. Swiss banks were cloistered bureaucracies in which
only Swiss nationals couldhope for employment and promotion. Of
Switzerland's big three banks, Swiss Bank was the most traditional.
Marcel Ospel, the head of Swiss Bank's international division, meant
to change this. Though he had started as a sixteen-year-old appren-
tice, splitting his time bet\177veen banking and school, Ospel had done
a stint at Merrill Lynch and realized that Switzerland's banks would
have to modernize or go the way of the cuckoo clock. He used
O'Connor to shake up the parochial culture in Basel, injecting Yan-
kee ideassuch as an incentive system that rewarded traders for long-
term perf(lrn\177ance. In 1995, Ospel engineered the purchase (if S. G.
Warburg, Britain's largest investment bank, and Swiss Bank was
cloistered no more.
Toolate, Cabiallavetta, Ospel's counterpart at tbc riw)l UBS, real-
ized that Swiss Bank was building a p(lwerhot\177s\177\" in derivatives that
outclassed his own. Charismatic and loud where ()sp\177'l was quiet and
shy,Cabiallavetta panicked and became' d\177'spcrate to overtake the up-
start. Hewas especially keen on building the relationship with Long-
Term, which he idealizedas the pt'rfect partner in derivatives. The
best way to do that, hedecided,was t(1 approve Myron Scholes's war-
rant. At Swiss Bank, the warrant had been flatly rejected, but at UBS,
it had percolated toward the highest echelons (if the bank. Lim, the

trader, and Bauer, the derivatives boss, who still regretted not having
made an investment in Long-Term, had both embraced the warrant.
Steven Schulman, the risk manager at UBS, had given it a faw\177rable
nod. So had Werner Bonadurer, who oversaw trading. That left it to
Cabiallavetta. In June i997, a hungry UBSagreedto sell Long-Term
its long-sought warrant. In a companion part of the agreement, UBS,
assuming a massive risk, became the single biggest investor in the
fund.
The terms calledforagroupof the partners to pay UBSa premium
of $289 million. In return, UBS promised to pay the partners any
profits (more or less) that an investor with $8oo million worth of
l,ong-Term would make over the next seven years. Asa hedge against
this obligation, UBS bought an $800 million interest in the fund. Fi-
nally, as a sweetener, the bank was permitted to invest an additional
$z66 million in Long-Term. That was the \"basic idea,\" according to
Tannenbaum, the salesman: \"If we wrote them calls on their own
stock, they would let us invest a third again as much in the equity of
the
fund.\"
Tannenbaum's superiors regarded the warrant as a coup. UBS's
managerswereso ecstatic that they fought over which division of the
bank should book the transaction. Bonadurer claimed it for the fixed-
income division--an oddchoice,except that Bonadurer and Cabi-
allavetta wereclose friends. Then, part of the dealwas shifted to the
bank's treasury department, which paid a 5 percent premium. '\17U7BS's
managers figured that eventually they could repackage their Long-
Term investment and sell it to wealthy clients; in the meantime, they
chortled about their new strategic relationship to Meriwether.Cabi-
allavetta toasted their alliance in Hong Kong, where he and ,].M.
were attending the annual meeting of the World Bank, always a hot
attraction for international financiers.
At Long-Term, Hilibrand and Scholes stormily debated how big a
share of the warrant would be allotted to each. Scholes had put his
brains into it, but Hilibrand had the most money and, characteristi-
cally, wanted the lion's share. By switching the partners' prospective
income to capital gains, the warrant would lower their tax rate, but
the more significant motive seemedto be the hope of further gains.
Assuming the fund rose, the warrant would work on their fortunes
like rocket fuel. Of course, if the fund should falter, the partners
would lose the $289 million. But there is nothing like successto blind

one to the possibility of failure. At the very time when the outlets for
their narrow skills were closing, the partners tossed off their innate
caution, which had served them so well, like an old suit.
Many put their entire net worth into the fund. Mullins, the former
Fedofficial,was an exception; he stuck to his characteristic banker's
prudence and opted out of the warrant. '\177Otherwise, Siciliano noted,
\"These guys believed in what they were doing with every ounce of
their being.\" The partners also forged a similar, though smaller, war-
rant deal with Credit Suisse, another Swiss investment bank.
But even that was not enough. To leverage even further, LTCM, the
partners' management company, borrowed a total of $\177oo million
from a trio of banks--Chase, Fleet Bank, and CrSdit Lyonnais of
France--which money the partners plowed right back into the fund.\"
Their hunger to turn millions into billions knew no bounds, nor did
it recognize any risks. For men who prided themselves on being dis-
ciples of reason, their drive to live on the edge seemed inexplicable,
unless they believed that becoming the richest would certify them as
also being the smartest.
As if to tempt the fates, Hilibrand personally borrowed $z4 mil-
lion more from CrSdit Lyonnais, which set up a program to let the
partners borrow against their interests in the fund. Hans Hufschmid,
who specialized in currency tr\177tdes, borrowed $15 million, al\177d two
other partners borrowed lesseramounts.'- In addition, some of the
partners had leveraged personally with Bear Stearns, their broker.
Considering that the fund itself was so heavily leveraged, the part-
ners, Hilibrand in particular, were dangerously adding leverage to
leverage,as if coating a flammable tinderbox with kerosene. As op-
posed to a poor man who bets the limit on a single horse, the already
rich Hilibrand had little to win and everything to lose.
TheUBS warrant raised $\177billion of equity for Long-T\177-rm at the
worst possible moment--when the' fund was struggling to find places
to invest the money it already had and wht'n it was fighting off more
and morecompetitors in arbitrage. In the first half of \179797, it earned
only \1773percent before fees--still impressive, though well below its
prior average.Its leverage (again, not counting derivatives) fell from
3\260to \177to zo to i, evidence that opportunities had grown scarce. A
group of skeptical partners, including Scholes, were growing increas-
ingly uncomfortable with the fund's portfolio.
One bright spot was Japan, where Long-Termwas extremely prof-

itable, thanks in part to David Modest, a graying, forty-three-year-
old former scholar. Modest, Rosenfeld, and a young trader named
CarlHuttenlocher devised a series of equity arbitrages to exploit the
Japanese lack of familiarity with, and mispricing of, options. Long-
Term's models made this an \"obvious\" and, indeed, highly lucrative
trade. Modest, a droll theoretician from Berkeley, and a handful of
others would work the graveyard shift, staying until t A.M., when the
next day's Tokyo market finally closed. Shortly after, while Green-
wich slept, a skeleton crewwould arrive in time for the opening in
London, where Japanese warrants traded. \"We had a couple of
traders like David [Modest] just killing themselves,\"Rosenfeldre-
called. In June i997, the traders wereable to revert to normal hours,
asLong-Termopened a Tokyo office. It was run by Chi-fu Huang, a
prizedMIT mathematician and expert in modeling whom Long-Term
snatched away from Goldman Sachs, and Arjun Krishnamachar, a
former swaps trader at Salomon.
J.M., who had been traveling to Japan for years,liked having an
institutional presence there. For a Western hedge fund in Tokyo,
Long-Termhad remarkable cachet. Mullins, who had informally ad-
visedJapanese government officials when he had worked at the Fed,
continued to do so at Long-Term W. herever it operated, the fund's
tentacles penetrated to the highest reaches. The partners' circle of
contacts was a major asset.
Even m Japan, the partners pursued acontroversialtrade. In I997,
Japan's long bond was yielding only z percent, seemingly rock
tom. Long-Termplaceda naked, unhedged bet that this rate would
rise--a so-called directional trade in that it was betting on a single
rate as distinct from aspread. Many of the partners had doubts about
the trade, which for Long-Term was unusually speculative. But Hill-
brand and Haghani were increasingly running the firm irrespective of
the weaker partners' wishes. With the results so good, it \177vaseasy to
dismiss the naysayers as worrywarts.
At 1,ong-Term's I997 annual meeting, in .]uly, the partners admitted
they were concerned about the shrinking spreads in bond arbitrage.
The meeting had to be held outside the United States, so as not to
jeopardizeLong-Term's legal status as an offshore fund. It was hosted
in a hotel by the Toronto airport so that the partners could jet in

and out in a day. Only four of them (Leahy, Mullins, Rosenfeld, and
Scholes)and about twenty-five investors attended. The mood was
downbeat:spreads had converged more quickly than the partners
had expected, squeezing potential profits. Though typically taciturn,
Rosenfelddid reveal that Long-Term was getting involved in equity
trades. The small crowd of investors suddenly livened. One investor
demanded, \"We hear you're the biggest player in risk arbitrage.
Are you?\" Rosenfeld responded evasively. The investors sensed that
Long-Terln was approaching a denouement. \"Do you have any
plan to return the money?\" an investor asked. Again, Rosenfeld was
vague. \"Well, whatever you do, don't return mine,\" the investor said.
\225
Coincident with the dour outlook for arbitrage, two prominent fi-
nance professors published a paper arguing that arbitrage was far
riskier than its adherents clailned--the first shot at Long-Term's
modelfired from within academe. Writing in the prestigious Journal
of Finance, Andrei Shleifer of Harvard and Robert W. Vishny of
Chicago presciently warned that an arbitrage firm of Long-Term's
type could be overwhelmed if \"noise traders\" (meaning uninformed
speculators)pushedprices away from true value. With uncanny fore-
sight, they predicted that, in such a case, arbitrageurs would \"expe-
rience an adverse price shock\" and be forced to liquidate at market
lows. '\17M7erton read an early version prior to publication but was not
convinced; at a conference of scholars in Cambridge, he pooh-
poohed the notion that markets could everbe overwhelmed. '\177'
Then, in July, just weeksafterthe warrant deal, international mar-
kets were badly shaken. Thailand, beset by financial defaults, al-
lowed its currency to float. It prolnptly fell ,_o percent. The weakness
spread to currencies in the Philippines, Malaysia, and South Korea.
Responding to the sharp declines, Karim Abdel-Motaal, an emerging-
markets guru at J. P. Morgan, declared, \"We think the sell-offs have
been exaggerated ''. -'\177'They continued anyway. Singapore's dollar
came under heavy selling. Only Indonesia, by far the largest of the
Asian \"Tigers,\" seemed resistant. Then, on a single day, the rupiah
fell 5 percent. In less than a month, pundits had stopped talking of
Asia's miracle; now it was Asia's \"crisis.\" Glass-walled skyscrapers
erected during the boom were suddenly going vacant, and factories
stood idle. Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister of Malaysia,

blamed \260'rogue speculators\" from overseas, specifically GeorgeSoros,
for selling the Tigers out.
Mahathir had some of the right culprits but the wrong crime. For-
eignerscould hardly be blamed for deserting a listing ship\177 their sin
was having provided the too-easy short-term credit that had launched
the ship at flank speed. Comforted by Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin's bailout of Mexico, Western banks and investorshadshoveled
money at Asia, fueling speculative investments and underwriting the
region's corrupt behavior. Rubin had paved the way by urging Asian
governments to lift controls on capital and thus to allow the money
to pour in--despite the area's appalling lack of corporate disclosure
and regulatory oversight. \"The simple fact is that very sophisticated
banks loaned to Indonesian companies, without any real knowledge
of their financial condition,\" noted James Wolfensohn, president of
the World Bank. \177'\177
Though Western investors had repeatedly made the same mis-
take-today romanticizing the developing world, tomorrow coming
to rue their naivet\177--the bankers never learned. In \197796, $93 billion
of foreign capital had flooded Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
South Korea, and Thailand even as their economies were slowing.
Now that same money was draining out, unnerving markets around
the world. From Long-Term's point of view, both Asia's uphill and
downhill slopes were instructive. Easy credit, which hedge funds also
enjoyed, had led to ill-advisedandexcessive investments. Then, when
the tables had turned, Greenspan's much-vaunted liquidity was no-
whereto be found, and the damage spread almost at random.Once
a typhoon breaks loose in markets, there is no telling where it will go.
\225
In late summer, the fund received a bit of bad news: the MCI merger
was renegotiated at a lower price.MCI's stock price collapsed, and
Long-Term lost $\1775o million overnight--the first sign that it had
been fishing in dangerous waters. In Asia, where Long-Term's invest-
ments were primarily in Japan, the fund was weathering the storm.
September, in fact, was one of Long-Term'sbest months: it earned
$300 million.
But the firm's prospects were steadily dimming. When the partners
returned from their annual golfing party in Waterville with Merrill
Lynch, they announced a shocking diktat: outside investors in Long-

Term would have to take back about half of their money, just as \177hc
investor at the annual meeting had feared. \"The fund has excess cap-
ital,\"Meriwether explained. The capital account was closeto $7bil-
lion, almost as much as at mighty Merrill l,ynch. Accenting the
positive, J.M. adde& \"This has occurred primarily because ofa sub-
stantial increase in the capital base from the larger-than-expected,
past realized rates of return, and high reinvestment rates elected by
the fund's investors.\"-'-'
Still, there was no getting around the harsher truth that spreads
had narrowed and opportunities had diminished. With a common
European currency now a fair accompli, the easy money on conver-
gence in Europe had already beenmade. With borders disappearing,
the spread between Italian and German bonds had shrunk from z
percentage points to three quarters ofa point in just six months.
Long-Term's plan was to return, at the end of i997, all profits on
money invested during i994, its first year, and to return all money
(principal and profits) invested after that date. It excluded the part-
ners and employees and partially excluded some big strategic in-
vestors such as the Bank of Taiwan. Jimmy Cayne, chief executive of
Bear Stearns, Long-Term's clearing broker, got an exception, too.
Others demanded to stay in, but l\177(mg\177Tcrm turned them down. They
were naturally angry that Mcriwether and his boys, supposedly
charged with watching out for their investors' interests, were giving
themselves preferential treatment. \"This isoutrageous!\"one investor
thundered to Merrill Lynch. \"We were there when they needed us.\"
The plan was controversial within Long-Term, too. Jim McEntee,
J.M.'sfriend, thought simple conservatism weighed in favor of not re-
turning capital. Scholes and Merton, an inseparable pair, were
strongly opposed to giving it back as well. They felt the firm was
souring its franchise as a money manager. What's more,since the aca-
demics owned a bigger proportional share of I.TCM, the manage-
ment company, than they did of the portfi\177lio, they had a personal
interest in seeing the total of funds under management grow. On the
other hand, Hilibrand and Haghani, who owned so much of the
fund, didn't want to dilute their stakes by including outside owners.
As usual, the latter two carried the day. Scholes was furious at Hill-
brand, a control freak who gave little apparent thought to his part-
ners.
In retrospect, the outsideinvestors'pleas to stay in the fund would

seem ironic, and the forced redemption of their moneywould come
to seem a godsend. It was the partners who would suffer the most.
But without the benefit of hindsight, the partners' obsessive pursuit
of wealth carried more than a whiff of greed. Now that they had the
scale to operate worldwide, they had no interest in managing money
for others and largely froze them out. They added an unusually self-
serving touch, tacking on fees,forthe first time, to the bonus money
invested by some of their own employees!
The partners justified the forced redemption asasensibleresponse
to diminished prospects. Myron Scholes said it was ironic that Long-
Termwas giving money back at the same time that newcomers were
piling into the field.-\" The implication was that Long-Termwas pru-
dently scaling back in the faceof shrinking spreads. Yet the fund was
not going to shrink by one iota. Returning capital only reduced the
equity supporting its assets, which weren't, in fact, shrinking at all.
Indeed,at a time when opportunities were drying up and the portfo-
lio was bloated with 7,600 positions, the fund was defiantly and ill-
advisedly leveraging itself further, like an Icarus chasing the sun. \177*
Moreover, by forcing outsiders to sell, the partners were, once
again, increasing their personal leverage in the fund. The personal
debt, on top of the leverage in the management companyand the debt
in the fund itself, made for three levels of debt precariously pyra-
mided oneatop the other.
Six days after Meriwether informed investors that they would have to
take money back, the firm's cradle, Salomon Brothers,dropped a
bombshell of its own. Salomon had never fully regained its footing
after the Mozer scandal, the exit of Meriwether, and the defections of
Rosenfeld,Haghani, Hawkins, and Hilibrand. It had tried to build its
investment bank, but the bank hadn't been profitable. Now its arbi-
trage unit was facing the same pressures as Long-Term was. Earlier
in the year, its executives had agree(| that Salomon would needasig-
nificant infusion of capital or risk becoming a second-class firm.
Warren Buffett, who, through Berkshire Hathaway, was Salomon's
biggest shareholder, was constitutionally opposed to investing more
money in failing enterprises, which time and again he had equated
with throwing good money after bad. Deryck Maughan, the chief ex-
ecutive of Salomon, made it clear that the only other option was to

sell the company. \"Warren wanted to sell so badly,\" a director of the
company said.
But to whom? Maughan sounded out Chase, but the bank rebuffed
him. Then he had lunch with Sanford I. Weill, chairman ofTravelers,
the insurer and parent of broker Smith Barney. Weill was one of the
great second acts in American business. The son of a Brooklyn dress

After the lunch with Maughan, Weill called backto resist that he

one--at a good price, naturally. Wcill offered $9 billion in stock, bail-
ing the Omaha sage out of one of his mosttroubled investments. Ever

It is interesting to contrast I,ong-Termand its mother firm as each

ployer in every way that counted. In capital, Long-Term boasted $7 bil-
lion to Salomon's $5 billion. In profits, the hedge fund had earned$z. \177

ment bank. Salomon still had a profitable arbitrage unit, but its at-

the idea of diversifying, had remained focused, a smart decision thns

riod. Their responses were \1778o degrees apart. By merging Salomon
with a more diversified partner, Buffett had diluted the Salomon share-

holders' interests in arbitrage and in the rest of Salomon'sbusiness.
Now they would own pieces ofa much larger Travelers. Long-Term's
partners had made the exact opposite decision:to agreatextent, they
had bought out their partners, thus redoubling their bets on arbitrage.
The irony was that Buffett had converteda chronicloser into $9 bil-
lion while Long-Term's partners had converted a consistent winner
into a giant--and still unrealized--bet on the future.

In Octc\177ber, the fund got a positive jolt: Merton and Scholes won the
Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science. Merton, who was teach-
ing a class at Harvard, gota three-minute ovation from his students. He
humbly warned, however, \"It's a wrong perceptionto believe that you
can eliminate risk just because you can measure it.'' Scholes s, itting for
a celebrity profile with his hometown Ottawa Citizen, was brusquely
reminded of how skeptical the outside world was of derivatives.The
Citizen had the temerity to inquire, \"How responsible do you feelfor
the \177987 stock market crash?\" The stunned Nobel laureate sputtered,
\"Not at all.Not really at all. It's the sameas asking IAlfred] Nobel if
he is responsiblefor the First World War because he invented dyna-
mite.\" Pressed, Scholes admitted that people trading on his theory--
meaning dynamically hedging, or selling on the way down--had
exacerbated the crash, though he blamed a lackof \"liquidity,\" the fa-
miliar scapegoat. Always good at reducing high finance to everyday
English, Scholes described Long-Term in refreshingly plain terms:
\"What we do is look around the world for investments that we think
are, because of our models, undervalued or overvalued. And then we
hedgeout the risk of something we don't know, like a market factor.\"-'
From their colleagues in academe, Merton and Scholcsgot effusive
praise; the rule that six economists have seven opinions on every sub-
ject did not apply to the Black-Scholestheorem, which was hailed as
a towering contribution to theory as well as practice.Gregg Jarrell, a
Chicago School economist at the University of Rochester, called it
\"one of the most elegantand precise models that any of us has ever
seen. '\177-\1B77ut was reality so precise? No matter. The Economist
toned, \"What Mr. Merton and Mr.Scholesdid,back in \179773, was to
put apriceon risk.\"-'\" A writer in The Wall Street Journal found proof
in the award of the newspaper's most cherished belief, succinctly
opining, \"The Royal Swedish AcademyofSciences has made a clear

It was an odd timeto expressone's faith. All across Asia, currency
and stock markets were imploding. One day the epicenterwas Thai-
land, the next Malaysia, then Indonesia. On a single day, October
Indonesia's rupiah plunged 6.5percent, the Malaysian ringgit fell 4.5
percent, the Philippine peso z.z percent. Two days later, the rupiah
plunged 8.5 percent more. Though Asians had sown the seeds of their
own crisis, no one wasprepared for the market's brutality or for the
random way in which the contagion spread. Even Latin American
markets werepounded. In the age of the lnternet, markets seemed
connected by an invisible plasma linking the fate of bourses oceans
apart. By late October, companies across Asia were defaulting, rais-
ing the specterofrecession Sp. eculators then turned their guns on the
Hong Kong dollar. The government, still under the British Crown,
taliated, raising overnight interest rates to a staggering 300 percent.
The island's stock market gave up z3 percent in a week.
By now, U.S.investors, fearing that Asia's agony would trigger a
global slowdown, were in full retreat. The Dow, which had reached
a high of 8,300 during the summer, had fallen through most of
tober. On the Friday before Halloween, it fell more than \177oo points,
to 7,7t5 . Then on Monday, October z7--yet anotllcr miscrabh'

began in Hong Kong, where the market loll (, percent. As America
awoke, the New York Stock Exchange was hit with heavy selling. It

writers, who had sold insnrance against a marketdrop, were desper-
ately selling stocks, similar to BlackMonday a decadeearlier)' Met-
ton and Scholes's genie had escaped from the bottle again. As always,
this chain-reaction selling--the dynamic hedging that Merton had en-
visioned in his model--made a bad day worse. Thel)ow fell a record
554 points, a drop of 7 percent. Around the world, from the United
States to Asia to Europeto l.atm America, markets lost an estimated
Sx.z trillion, or 6 percent of their total w\177luc.\" In a speech to the
Brookings lnstitntion just two days later, Nick Brady blamed the
leverage implicit in derivative markets for worsening the damage:
I have heard all the arguments about how derivatives and dy-
namic hedging decreases transaction costs and increases the
depth of markets. But certainly carried to extremes they are not
worth what they cost .... Excess levcrage's part in last week's
sell-offis well worth a lot of thought. \177

Long-Term Capital dodged the bullet again. The fund broke even
in October and November, quite an accomplishment. Indeed\177 for
Long-Term, Asia was an opportunity. With markets whipped up
(more \"volatile,\" as traders would say), Long-Term began to place
hefty derivative bets that stock trading would settle down--or that
the volatility of stocks would fall. This was risky stuff. Salomon had
made this bet before October and had lost $iio million. But short-
ing volatility was the most natural of bets for Long-Term. In a sense,
every one of its spread trades was a bet on lessened volatility. When
markets are jumpy, the premium for safety isgreater; when markets
settle down, spreads tend to contract. \"A lot ofour trades were 'vol'
trades,\" Rosenfeld noted) \17I7n one form or another, the fund was al-
ways betting on calmer or moreconvergent markets.
UBS, Long-Term's new big investor, also had gambled on equity
w\177latility, and that and other exotictrades were turning into a disas-
ter for the bank. Rumors were circulating ofmassivelosses in the de-
rivatives unit, run (with total autonomy) by Goldstein, who had
pocketed an $\177\177.5million bonus for i996. \177W<hen toted up, UBS's
losses in :\177997 would reach $644 million. Among other bad trades,
UBSlost heavily on Japanese convertibles, which Long-Termhad un-
derstood better. Cabiallavetta, the bank's chief executive, had long
protected Goldstein. Now he finally realized that his pet trader was
destroying the bank. In November, Cabiallavetta forced Goldstein
to resign.
Then, in December, Cabiallavetta admitted that his bank was
bereft of leadership and humbly struck a merger with the archrival
Swiss Bank. Although Cabiallavetta would stay as chairman and the
bank would keep the UBSname, Swiss Bank was clearly the winner.
Basel filled most of the important jobsand imposed its more conser-
vative culture on the gunslingers in Zurich. Ironically, by merging
with its flamboyant rival, Swiss Bank had become a party to the
I.ong-Term warrant that it previously had spurned.

In Stockholm, Merton and Scholes put up at the Grand, a sumptuous
hotel with a curving staircase,overlooking the old city. At the Nobel
banquet, a black-tie affair for 1,2oo, the laureates sat with a few
friends and family members, the king and queen, various princes,and
the queen's mother. Waiters and waitresseswhohad auditioned from

all over Sweden servedsmoked fish on silver platters. The laureates
were in a bubbly mood. Merton, as if to reassure himself that he was
really there, kept inquiring of his guests, \"Arc you having a good
time?\" He gave a brief toast, expressing gratitude and also regret that
FischerBlackhadn't lived to share the award.
Merton's lecture to the academy focused on the applications
spawned by his option theory, ranging from adjustable-rate mort-
gages to student loan guarantees to flexible health care plans.
\" 'Option-like' structures were soon seento be lurking everywhere,\"
Merton asserted, though it seems unlikely that cause and effectwere
so direct. His own principal contribution, Merton noted--this being
two months after the Dow's 554-point one-dayspill--had been to
show that \"dynamic trading prescribed by Black and Scholcs...
would provide a perfect hedge in the limit of continuous trading.\"\"
\225
Despite the festive mood, both laureates were deeply concerned
about Long-Term's future. Though Scholes confidently told Eugene
Fama, his old adviser, that Long-Term Capital was safely making a
thousand small bets, Scholesdecided not to invest his half of the
million-dollar Nobel bounty in the fund.' Ironically, the ivory-tower
academicshad a keenersense of the risks than the seasoned traders
did. Scholes and Merton were both leading the good life. Scholes
drove a white BMW; Merton, the car buff, sported a dark Jaguar.
Scholeshad rented a spacious home overlooking the water in Green-
wich. Merton had dyed his hair red, left his wife, and moved into a
snazzy pad in Boston. But their fortunes were relatively small, and
neither felt as invulnerable as their multimillionaire partners did. As
outsiders, not traders, they had a perspective not shared by Hili-
brand. The laureates could see that the fund was moving away from
its sphere of expertise and adding risk at \177heworst possible moment.
Moreover, Merton was highly agitated about the fund's compensa-
tion structure, which was top-weighted toward ttilibrand and
Haghani. As an options expert, he kncw that the senior partners had
an added incentive to shoot for the moon--a \"moral hazard,\" as
economists say. The hunger the traders had shown at Salomon to
make as much as possible, no matter what the scale, was still alive
and still disfiguring their relations with their partners. Krasker, the
cautious modeler, was worried, too; he took money out of the fund

at the end of i997. Randy Hiller, who had been part ofthe group at
Salomon, ominously told a friend that he thought Long-Term was an
accident waiting to happen.
At year-end, when l,ong-Term returned $2.7 billion to investors,
its leverage ratio skyrocketed from 38 to \177to 28 to i (as always, not
including derivatives). Thus, though the firm's prospects looked
bleaker than ever, the partners had raised their leverage back to the
level prevailing during the business's salad days. With derivatives, it
may have beeneven higher.
Long-Term managed to earn 25 percent(17 percent after fees) in
1997--its worst year yet but still a remarkable achievement, given
the deteriorating market. The original investors got $\177.8z back for
each $\177they had put into the fund and still had their original dollar
m. Thanks to their exorbitant fees and tax deferrals, the partners did
even better--much better. Their capitalsoared36 percent to an ex-
alted $\177-9 billion, some 4\260percent of the fund's total of $4-7 billion.
Now the partners were on the brink of amassing dynastic fortunes.
Though it was an odd time to beexpanding,at the end of the year
Long-Term moved into plush new headquarters. Thesite, overlooking
a car wash, was pedestrian for Greenwich, but the office bespoke the
firm's inflated self-image as a fixture among Wall Street banks. It had
a large trading floor sporting three double rowsof ergonomically ad-
justable desks and roomtoaccommodatea planned expansion. It also
had a three-thousand-square-foot gym with separate locker rooms for
men and women and a full-time trainer. Twopool tables were ceremo-
nially housed in a big room in the back. J.M. had a largeoffice off to
the side, and conferencerooms and a library were slung around the
perimeter.Likea miniversion of Salomon, the firm it had surpassed,
Long-Term had a (quite large) data center as well as a backup genera-
tot under the building that supposedly could light all Greenwich for a
day. But the partners cut back on the office Christmas party in defer-
ence to their modestyear.The mood was noticeably subdued.
Mullins felt the firm had done agood job of heading off trouble in
1997- \"We anticipated Asia--or had a strategy for it,\" he said.'* But
the professors had overlooked the larger truism of Asia: In times of
trouble, markets becomemore closely linked, and seemingly unre-
lated assetsrise and fall in tandem. They barely noticed a seemingly
remote news item that movedover the wires just before Christmas:
Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, had downgraded Russia'sdebt.

David Modest, vw)uld be indecipherable to 999 out of \177,oooAmeri-
cans. But more than any other, \"equity vol\" was Long-Term's signa-
tm'c trade, and it set the fund ineluctably on the road to disaster.
Equity w\177lcomes straight from the Black-Scholesmodel. It is based
on the assumption that the volatility of stocks is, over time, consis-
tent. The stock market, forinstance, typically varies by about \17S7per-
ccnt to zo percent a year. Now and then, the mnrkct might be morc
volatile, but it will al\177vays revert to form--or so the mathematicians
in Greenwich belicvcd. It was guided by the unseen law of large num-
bers, which assured the world of a normal distribution of brown
cows and spotted cows and quiet tradmA days and market crashes.
For l.ong-Term's professors, with their suprcmc faith in markets, this
was written in stone. It flowed from their Mcrtonian view of markets
as cfficient machines that spit out new prices with all the random
logic of heat molecules dispersing through a cloud. And when the
models told them that the markets wcrc mispricmg equity vol, they
were willing to bet thc firm on it.



==================================================

==================================================

124 \225WHEN GENIUS FAILED
There isno stockor security known as \"equity vol,\"no direct way of
making a wager on it. But there is an indirect way. Remember that,
according to the Black-Scholes formula, the key element in pricing an
option is the expected volatility of the underlying asset. As the asset
gets jumpier, the price of the option rises.Therefore, if you knew the
price of an option, you could infer the level of volatility the market
wasexpecting.
An analogy may be helpful. There isno direct way to bet on the
weather in Florida--but in certain seasons, the price of orange juice
futures fluctuates according to the likelihood of a frost. Indeed, an
experienced trader could infer, if the price of juice was unusually
high, that the market was expecting a chilly winter and thus a
scarcity of oranges. And if the trader believed that the market's
weather forecast was wrong, he could try to profit on his opinion by
shorting orange juice.
In a similar manner, Long-Term deduced that the options mar-
ket was anticipating volatility in the stock market of roughly zo
percent. Long-Term viewed this as incorrect, because actual vola-
tility was only about r5 percent. Thus, it figured that option prices
would sooner or later fall. So Long-Termbeganto short options--
specifically, options on the Standard & Poor's5oostock index and
on the equivalent indiceson the major exchanges in Europe. In their
own argot, the professorswere \"selling volatility.\"
The people on the other side of the option trade may not havere-
alized it, but they, in turn, were buying volatility. Let's think about
them for a moment. Typically, the buyers of options were equity in-
vestors who wanted insurance against a market decline. They were
willing to pay a small premium against the risk of a crash. Long-
Term,on the other side, collected the premium but was committed to
paying out if the n\177arket swooned. In fact, it sold insurance (options)
both ways--against a sharp downturn \177nd against a sharp rise.
Thebuyers, not being as sophisticated as Long-Term,didn't know
whether option prices were right or wrong, but, like a man with a
beautiful beachfront home who fearsa nasty hurricane season, they
wanted insurance at whatever the going rate. With Asia still in tur-
moil and with stocks at nosebleed levels, investorswere understand-
ably jittcry. One could scarcely pick up the paper but that some

BANK OF VOLATILITY \225125
pundit was predicting the crash to end all crashes. So it was hardly
surprising that people were paying more for protection, driving up
the price of options. Institutions in Europe were capitalizing on peo-
ple's fears by marketing equity products with downside protection--
that is, equities that \"couldn't\" go down! To protect themselves in
case stocks did fall, these institutions, too, were buying insurance,
which in Long-Term's view was artificially inflating option prices.
If Long-Term was right--if the price of options was too high--
then in effect it was charging a premiumprice for insurance, and over
the life of its option contracts, which was five years, it should expect
to come out ahead. Many other hedge funds were doing the same
trade. These financial firms were providing market insurance to or-
dinary investors. This was not necessarilystupid.Tht' funds were say-
ing, \"If people are willing to pay foolish prices for insurance, why
shouldn't we sell it to them?\"
But the trades were quite risky nonetheless. For one, forecasting
the market's volatility is notoriously dicey--unless you believe that
the past isa reliable predictor of the fi\177ture. Who could predict when
acrisis in Asia might develop--or how jittery markets would become
if one did? Who could say how volatile the market \"should\" be? It
was like forecasting a frost in Florida.
What's more, l.ong-'I\177'rm could still lose money (m the equity vol
trade, even if it later turned out that its judgment about volatility had
been correct.Since long-dated options don't trade on exchanges,
Long-Term had to tailor private options contracts, which it sold to
big banks such asJ. P. Morgan, Salomon Brothers, Morgan Stanley,
and Bankers Trust. The market for such arcane contracts was thin,
with only a handful of players who traded on a \"by appointment\"
basis. And the market was inherently imbalanced. Banks such as
Morgan wereeager to \"buy\" volatility from Long-Term, because the
banks, in turn, were selling insurance to retail investors. In short,
there was a natural pool of people and institutions on the buying
side. That's why the price of volatility was often a bit higher than the
mathematicians deemed was logical. But on the selling side, there
were very few players. If no one came to sell or if equity investors
suddenly became moredesperate for insurance, the price of volatility
could go even higher.
And Long-Term would have to settle up--paying or receiving
monies according to how option prices moved--every day. It might

be right on equity vol in the long run, but only if it could stand the
pain in the short run. And over five years, the pain suffered on such
a large trade couldbeconsiderable On. a given day, it was possible
that no one would want to sell, in which case Morgan could mark up
the asset to whatever higher price it decided was reasonable. There-
fore, l.ong-Term wasn't betting only on the extent of ultimate real-
ized volatility, it was betting on day-by-day inferred volatility, as
determined by what other investors would pay for options. In effect,
it was betting that these other, and presumably less rational, investors
wouldn't bid up prices further. This was--so unlike the partners'
credo--rank speculation. By putting themselves at the mercy of
short-term fluctuations, the partners had abandoned whatever ad-
vantage lay in their precise mathematical models.
Long-Term shorted options at prices that implied a market volatil-
ity of \1779percent a year (traders refer to this as \"selling volatility at
19 percent\.") As option prices rose, Long Term continued to sell.
Other firms sold m tiny amounts. Not Longq'erm. It just kept selling.
Rosenfeld, Hilibrand, and Modest worked the trade in Greenwich;
Haghani and Hufschmid did it in l.ondon. Eventually, they had a
staggering $4 \260million riding on each percentage point change in eq-
uity volatility in the Uuited States and an equivalent amount in
Europe--perhaps a fourth of the overall market. Morgan Stanley
coineda nickname for the fund: the Central Bank of Volatility.
Indeed, equity vol was Long-Term'sarchetypal trade. In many of
its spread trades, the firm was indirectly expressing an opinion on
volatility. The partners believed that, over time, investors would be-
come more rational, more steady, more efficient--more like they
were--and thus that credit spreads would narrow. \"We'vealways
had that belief,\" Roseufeld noted. \17T7he equity vol trade was an ex-
plicit articulation of this doctrine; it underscored the central role that
volatility played in Long-Term's Mertonian universe. \"The MIT types
always want to short volatility,\" noted Andrew Hall, an oil trader
who had worked at Salomon in the \19778os. \"Academics have embed-

bilizing trend in Asia. In Europe, where the launch of the euro was
less than a year away, investors were bathing in a spirit of optimism.
In the United States, the Dowbroke into record territory. As investors
regained confidence, bond spreads narrowed. At the start of 199g ,
A-rated bonds (those issued by strong corporations, such as Ford
Motor) yielded 75 basis points more than Treasurys; by February, the
spreadhad narrowed to 70 points.
Such balmy currents, though apparently unrelated, reflected a gen-
eralized feeling that the crisis of the previous fall had passed even
though a certain edginess lingered. In October 1997, after the deba-
cle in Asia, Merrill Lynch had ordered its bond traders to downsize
their positions. They had in fact pulled back, but by the beginning of
1998 they were reverting to business as usual.The world had gotten
past so many crises; it had seen the United Statesand the IMFrescue
Mexico, Thailand, Korea. \"No one believed that Asia would
spread,\" noted Dan Napoli,Merrill'srisk manager, referring to the
traders who put the firm's capital on the line. As such sanguine atti-
tudes percolated up from the trading desk of bank after bank, credit
spreads
inevitably narrowed.
The mood at Long-Term was relaxed,too. Thollgh the fund's
leverage was up, and though the parmers had taken om huge per-
sonal loans, their exposure seemed tolcrable. According to one es-
timate, Hilibrand alone was worth half a billion dollars and
Meriwether was in the low hundreds of millions. And the partners
had seemingly tailored the fund's portfolio to control the risk. Ac-
cording to their models, the maximum that they were likely to lose
on any single trading day was $45 million---certainly tolerable for a
firm with a hundred times as much in capital. \17A7ccording to these
same models,the odds against the firm's suffering a sustained run of
bad luck--say, losing 4 \260percent of its capital iu a single month--
were unthinkably high. (So far, m their worst month, they had lost
a mere 2.9percent.)Indeed, the figures implied that it would take a
so-called ten-sigma event--that is,astatistical freak occurring one in
every ten to the twenty-fourth power tilncs--for the firm to lose all
of its capital within one year.;
If the partners were anxious, it was not about losing; it was that
they wouldn't find enough investments where they could win. As the
pressure to find suitable trades mounted, they increasingly strayed
into more exotic tundra, such as Brazilian and Russian bonds and

Danish mortgages. Martin Siegel, who handled Brazil and other
emerging markets, wasa misfit at Long-Term. An old-time trader, he
knew nothing about models. Siegel had made money for Meriwether
at Salomon by investing in the Mexican telephone company, and
J.M., typically, had given him a job at Long-Term out of loyalty.
Long-Term also began to make more directional bets, abandoning
(for a fraction of its portfolio) the cautious hedging strategy that had
been its trademark. Scholeswas deeply upset by such trades, partic-
ularly its big position in Norwegian kroner. He argued that Long-
Term should stick to its models; it did not have any \"informational
advantage\" in Norway.; A year or so before, Haghani had exploded
at the suggestion that Long-Term invest in Greece. \"How can you
trust this economy?\"he had demanded. But when challenged himself,
he cast such quibblesaside. Haghani felt he could never lose; he
pushedand pushed his partners until he got his way.
The fund went deeper into equities, too. Knowing that many high-
tech companies issued puts (options) cheaply to manage their em-
ployee stock-option programs, Long-Term bought heaps of these
puts, issued by companies such as Microsoft and Dell, and hedged
them by selling puts on the S&P 500. Modest was the engineer in
these trades, but Haghani, invariably, was the architect. An associate
was stunned to find that Modest had even shorted big-company
stocks--reportedly including Microsoft, Dell, and General Electric--
seemingly on Haghani's whim. Modest explained to the associate,
\"Victor blew into town, heliked this trade and told meto do it.\" Mod-
est added, unnecessarily, \"Victor is Victor--what am I going to do?\"'
By now Long-Term was succumbing to the fatal temptation to put
its money someplace. In a clear speculation, it bet on the U.S. stock
market to decline, via options. \17T7hen, a young, statistically minded
equity researcher named Alain Sunier proposed buying stocks that,
according to a model, were likely to be added to the S&P index
(when a stock is added to the index, many portfolios are compelled
to buy it). Hilibrand got very interested in this trade. He ignored
Sunier's model,discardingSunier's companies and adding new ones.
And Hilibrand insisted on buying hefty stakes in every one of them.
Long-Term's notional investment in the trade soared to an astronom-
ical$2 billion. A colleague asked what had happened. Sunier threw
up his arms and replied: \"He [Hilibrand] turned off all my stocks.\"
Hilibrand also shorted Berkshire Hathaway, the holding company

run by Warren Buffett, believing that Berkshire was overpriced rela-
tive to its individual parts. But since many of Berkshire's assetswere
private, Hilibrand couldn't buy the parts, making it a poorly con-
ceivedarbitrage. Though usually coldly calculating, Hilibrand was
being a bit too clever--trying to profit at the billionaire's expense--
and dangerously moving the fund afield of its expertise. This was
plainly unwise. Even on well-conceivedtrades, the partners had lost
all sense of scale. In one trade that would lose them money, Long-
Term bought a huge \1757percent share, worth $480 million, of a junk-
bond issue from Starwood Hotels & Resorts, a real estate operator
that itself had a tendency to overreach.
Though their trades wanted for scrutiny more than ever, the part-
ners' weekly risk meetings became increasingly scripted. They no
longer had the patience to research and analyzetrades quite as they
had done with Italy. Though their debates were heated, the results
seemed preordained. Scholes protested about the size of the firm's
various positions. After all, the firm had had trouble exiting from
some of its largetrades--an obvious red flag. ' Merton, Mullins, and
McEntee made protests, too. But the dissenters stopped short of
threatening to quit, the one step that might have prompted J.M. aJld
Rosenfeldto confront their two top traders.
And Hilibrand and Haghani weren't really listening. Younger col-
leaguesespied an impulsive streak, not so surprising in Haghani, per-
haps, but totally baffling in the caseof Hilibrand. The intellectually
curious Modest was deeply resentful of having to be, as a colleague
teased him, \"Larry's execution slave.\"The rare Long-Term man with
Renaissance interests, Modest, who was raised in Boston, loved the
arts, literature, and opera. His interest in finance was more academic
than entrepreneurial; hc had never liked the senior partners' auto-
cratic reign and control \177vcr his time and had been thinking of bolt-
ing until \177998, when he had been made a jmm)r partner. When he
saw his partners departing from their trademark prudence, the firm
lost all its meaning for him. Totally dominated by the two senior
traders, Long-Term had become a lopsided firm; it was a partnership
only in name.
Wall Street knew nothing of these internal tensions; indeed, the
banks continued to give the fund a free ride. Merrill Lynch happily fi-
nanced the fund in Brazil--a risky mark\177't--on the dimmest of hair-
cuts. Becoming anxious, people on Merrill's repo desk squawked to

Robert McDonough, the Merrill credit officer responsible for hedge
funds, about Long-Term's exposure in emerging markets. McDon-
()ugh just laughed. \"We're in bed with these guys,\" he noted. \"If they
go down, we go down!\"
Few possibilities could have seemed more remote.Indeed, so
strong was Merrill's confidence in Greenwich that on April \177,lz3
starry-eyed Merrill executives purchased (in individual, separate
stakes) most ofMerrill's investment in Long-Term for the executives'
personal deferred compensation plans. Komansky, who had suc-
ceeded Tully as Merrill's chairman, put in $800,000; in total, the ex-
ecutives invested Szz million. Ironically, Merrill, Long-Term's
midwife, got out closer to the top than anyone else, leaving its own
executives to take the downhill ride.
Merrill's willingness to finance its client was part of a pervasivecli-
mate of financial laxity, palpable in Wall Street's eagerness to under-
write emerging markets. Russia was commonly touted as the next
capitalist nirvana. \"Peoplewere saying 'Asia was isolated, let's move
on.' The amount of money pursuing these areaswas tremendous,\"
noted Merrill's Richard Dunn, then head of debt markets in Europe
and the United Kingdom. At such times, it took uncommon courage
to refuse to lend, for it would have meant squandering businessto the
competition. \"We misread the haircuts that we needed to be pro-
tected,\" Dunn admitted. \"It wasn't a mistake we made singly for
Long-Term. The whole marketwas pressuring us. To suffer the orga-
nization telling you that you are losing business--it takes a tremen-
dous amount [of courage]to stand up and say, 'I'm not going to do
it.' The Street all got that collectively wrong.\"
In April, Sandy Weill, still trying to digest his ill-consideredacqui-
sition of Salomon, announced the biggest financial merger in history:
Travelers and Citicorp.The deal was emblematic of the Street'sPan-
glossian mood. Thirty-year Treasury yields had dipped below 6 per-
cent, reminiscent of the stable a\177d inn\177cent bond markets of
Meriwether's youth. The belief i\177a brighter t()morrow, coupled with
the general willingness to Ice,d, pushed down rates for even the least
creditworthy of borrowers. Spreads fell to their lowest levels in years.
A-rated bonds fell to 60 points (down from 75 at the start of the
year). The shrinking spreads worked like a tonic on Long-Term's
profit-and-loss statement. Having been flat in the first quarter, the
fund earned almost 3 percent in April. The end of April, approxi-

mately, was the low point for spreads, the high point for confidence,
and the high point for Long-Term Capital, which boasted $i34 bil-
lion in assets. In just over four years, an investment in the fund had
quadrupled, beforeaccountingfor the partners' fees. After deducting
this tithe, the value of a single dollar invested at the start had risen to
$z.85--a phenomenal \17785 percent profit in barely fifty months.
Far from resting on their laurels, the partners, led by Dick Leahy,
set up a Bermuda-based reinsurance subsidiary, christened Osprey
Re. Osprey, which was capitalized with $zoo million, reflectedLong-
Term's self-i\177nage as an insurer of financial risks. Now the partners
were planning to reinsure tangible risks, such as losses from severe
storms, earthquakes, hurricanes, and the like. Their mutual fund ven-
ture with BNL, the Italian bank, had beentabled by the Italians and
dropped. But the partners were exploring another new front: private
equity ventures.- Would nothing ever shake them?
In the manner of markets, the first hints of trouble werescattered,
small, and seemingly unrelated. John Succo,who ran the equity de-
rivatives deskat Lehman Brothers, was among those who felt that the
Street was playing with fire, specifically with the unseen leverage in
derivatives. At the end of April, Succo was speaking at an investors'
conferencesponsored by thc maverick newsletter publisher James
Grant. In response to a question, Succo dcclarcd that the senior man-
agements at some--possibly all--Wall Street firms had no idea of the
risks being run by their twenty-six-year-old traders. He hedgeda bit,
adding that his management wasbetter reformed. But the heresy was
accomplished. For suggesting that Wall Street's top brass was unin-
formed, the prophetic Succo was forcedto resign from Lehman.
Lloyd Blankfein, a partner at Goldman Sachs, was worried by
leverage in the system, too. Hc mentioned to Peter Fishcr, who ran
trading activities at the Ncw York Fed, that people wcrc wasting their
time trying to figure out whether somewhere there lurkcd a Mexico
that could trigger another finaucial crisis. Blanktein thought the next
big problem would beacredit prot\177lem, not a problem specific to any
one market. People weren't distinguishing among risks, Blankfein
complained, alluding to vanishing credit spreads. For the moment,
everything was a Treasury bill.
ForSteve Freidheiln of Bankers Trust, the alarm sounded during a
spring trip to Singapore and Hong Kong. Cognizant of Mexico's
rapid recovery,he was hopeful that Asia, too, would be back on its

feet in no time. But what Freidheim saw in Asia shook him: \"a lot of
big players\" were taking money off the table. During a lunch at a pri-
vate club in Hong Kong, a major banker suddenly changed the terms
of adealto reduce the banker's exposure to Asia. l\177reidheim returned
to the United States in a pessimistic mood. \"We began to short the
market after that,\" he recalled. Credit spreads at home had never
been tighter. There was only one way for them to go, he felt, espe-
cially if the still fragile condition of Asia should become apparent.
Imperceptibly at first, other Wall Street traders started to reach
similar conclusions. Banks and securities firms began to cut back
their inventories of riskier, less liquid bonds--which, of course, were
the very types of bonds in Long-Term's portfolio. \17T7he selling was not
coordinated, but the effect was much as if it had been, for the vari-
ous trading desks generally owned the same securities. Meriwether
may have felt a shudder of doubt, for in a visit with Siciliano, the
Swiss Bank manager, .I.M. saidhewas looking for ways to invest the
partners' capital outside the fund, perhaps in stocks or real estate.
Theyweretoo concentrated, J.M. added, as if forgetting that his part-
ners had recently passed up the chance to take backsome of their
capital.
By far, the firm where unease lay heaviest was Travelers.The firm's
bosses had been shocked to learn that the fixed-income arbitrageurs
at SalomonBrothers, their newly acquired subsidiary, routinely took
homeyear-endbonuses of $1o million and more. Weill and his top
lieutenant, JamieDimon,were hostile to the star system pioneered by
Hilibrand, under which traders at Salolnon (now Salomon Smith Bar-
ney) took home a percentage of their profits. Since the traders were
not penalized for losses, they had a perverse incentive to bet as much
of the company's money as they could. Essentially, Weill and Dimon
viewed arbitrage as a dressed-up form of gambling. Not surprisingly,
they took a dim view of Long-Term,a major Salomon client. Shortly
after the merger, Dimon asked I,ong-Term for more information.
Meriwether reflexively replied that such information was private.
Dimon,who had noallegiance to Greenwich, threatened to cut Long-
Termoff, and J.M. meekly complied with Dimon's request. \17A7 new
breeze was blowing.
Robert Stavis, the co-head of arbitrage at Salomon,was trying to
branch into equity trades, just as Long-Term was doing, but Stavis's
new bosses, particularly Steven Black,head of global equities at Sa-



==================================================
                     PAGE 142

lumon Smith Barney, blocked him. Stavis was eager to get bigger in
equity vol, but Black put his foot down. Always Long-Term'salter
ego, the Arbitrage Group at Salomon was turning into the more pru-
dent firm that Long-Term might have beenhadJ.M.steered it with a
firmer hand.
By April, Salomon's group was down $zoo million, prompting se-
rious discussions about its future. Stavis told Weill that he should be
prepared for further losses, which was not what Weill, who knew
that Wall Street focused on short-term earnings and was himself ob-
sessed with Travelers' stock price, wanted to hear. Aware that spreads
had diminished, the Travelers executives made a logical decision--
but one that had somehow eluded Mcriwcthcr--toscale the business
back. The only good newsat Salomon was that Travelers' pending
merger with Citicorp made Arbitrage seem less important. In dis-
cussing the possibility of trading losses, Weill was fond of saying, \"I'd
like to be big enough so that when we get theseexplosions they will
feel like pinpricks.\" As part of Citicorp, he would be. Still, as a check,
a Salomon official put in a call to Long-Termto find out how much
capital the hedge fund was using in its trades. Its answer: \"Almost
none.\" Salomon, which hadn't analyzed its arbitrage business quite
so intently, was unnerved. It was obvious that both firms had been re-
lying too much on leverage, and Salomou Smith Barney, at least,
began to cut back.
In May, contrary to the forecastsof Long-Term's models, arbitrage
spreads began to widen. Bondarbitrageurs sufferedlosses, setting off
a modest but hard-to-break cycle of selling. Firms such as Salomon,
which had less capital as a result of the losses, now were in violation
of their own computer-determined guidelinesregarding the proper
ratio of capital to assets. Thus, they sold a bit more. \"As people liq-
uidated, volatility moved up,\" a Salomon trader m l,oudon recalled.
\"That forced more people to liquidate.\"
It was still just a pinprick, but there wcrc more pins than Weill had
reckoned on, One of them punctured the mortgage market, where the
bond market trouble of I994 had started,too. Mortgage-backed se-
curities declined, prompting hedge fuuds to pare other exposures,
such as in emerging markets.'\" Suddeuly, Asiawas not socalm. In In-
donesia, the biggest of the Asian Tigers, the IMF bailout ran into
snags. Then, in May, street rioting forced President Suharto to resign
after thirty-two years in power. Thereal revolutionaries had been the

curreucy traders, who had forced a currency devaluation and ex-
posed acorrupt autocrat's nepotistic program as a failure.
Everyone knew the speculators' next target; ominously, it was Rus-
sia. Sergei Dubinin, chairman of the Russian central bank, said the
ruble was safe. Hoping to have the definitive word, he added, \"There
will be no devaluation of the ruble. ''\177 By the end of May, he had
tripled interest rates to halt the flight of capital. Russia's financial sys-
tem, already teetering, was now on the verge of collapse. In the
United States, meanwhile, the economy was slowing--always bullish
for bond prices. Yields on Treasurysfell,and thus the spread between
Treasurys and other types of bonds, such as corporate issues, began
to widen. This trend being the opposite of what Long-Termwas bet-
ting on, the fund had its worst month ever, losing 6.7percent.
Though Swiss Bank, which would beLong-Term's biggest investor
after merging with UBS, knew nothing of the losses, it was getting
nervous. After reviewing the warrant package, Tim Fredrickson, the
head of derivatives at Swiss Bank, called the bank's Siciliano and
warned him, \"This thing isn't too pretty.\" The basic problem was
that the investment was unhedgeable:Swiss Bank was completely ex-
posed on the downside. \"At that point,\" Sicilianorecalled, \"it was
like a benign tumor. If things were to go bad we'd have a problem,
but they had never had aproblem.\"
In June, Ron Tannenbaum, the UBSsalesman who had pitched the
warrant, left the bank--a footnote in the unfolding drama. Of greater
import, credit spreads continued to widen. More frightening still,
they widened in every market in which Long-Term was active. The
trouble wasn't specific to any security; it was ageneral pulling back
of credit, a pervasivesense that markets had been undercharging for
risk.Investorswanted safety; now they would pay any amount to buy
a Treasury (meaning that they would accept any lower yield, aslong
as they got out of riskier bonds).
Jim McEntee, J.M.'s friend and the one partner who relied on his
nose, as distinct from acomputer, sensed the trade-winds changing.
He repeatedly urged his partners to lower the firm's risks, but McEn-
tee was ignored asa nonscientific, old-fashioned gambler. Since mov-
ing to Connecticut, the partners, who no longer had to jostle with the
throngs on Wall Street every day, had become even more isolated

from the anecdotal, but occasionally useful, gossip that traders pass
around. They found it easy to brush off McEntee'salarums, particu-
larly since the Sheik's own trades had been losing money. Increasingly
frustrated, McEntee metJames Rickards, Long-Term's general coun-
sel, after work one night at the Horseneck Tavern in Greenwich.
Rickards was leaving the next morning on an expedition to climb
Mount McKinley in Alaska. \"By the time you get back, the world
will have completely changed,\" McEntee predicted darkly.
All over Wall Street, McEntee's fellow traders were now speaking
of a \"flight to quality\"--that is,to Treasurybonds. By mid-June, the
yield on the thirty-year Treasury had fallen to 5.58percent, the low-
est since the government had started issuing thirty-year bonds in
r977. \"Everyone in the [Treasury] market is afraid to go home
short,\" Matthew Alcxy, a strategist with Credit Suisse First Boston,
told The Wall Street Journal.'2 Except for Long-TermCapital, which
went home short on Treasurys every day.Treasurys were the basic
bo\177ld that the fund sold short to hedge the riskier bonds it owned.
And as Treasurys rallied, spreads between them and other bonds
widened. Mortgage-backed securities jumped from 96 basis points
overTreasurys to I \1737points. Corporate bo\177lds rose tro\177u 99
and junk issues rose fronl
the-run Treasurys clinlbed frolu 6 poilltS t)vcr H) 8 t)oilllS over. \177]`11
every market, the premiunl den\177andc'd for riskier bo\177lds increased, hi
every market, Long-Termwas losing money.
Why this all-consuming fear of risk? Once again, Asia was the
spark. In Japan, the yen was plummeting, accentuating the country's
already deep recession J. apanese bond yields were plummeting--
exactly the opposite of Long-Term's bet. And Japan was the corner-
stone of the East Asian economy. With Japanese importers scaling
back their purchases, there was talk of a regional depression. In In-
donesia, the rupiah had lost 85 percentof its precrisis value. In South
Korea,stocks plunged 8 percent in a single day. The fearwas perva-
sive, but every day, it emerged in a different place.
The drumbeat from Russia grew steadily louder. In June, Goldman
Sachs managed to sell$1.25 billion in five-year Eurobond notes for
the Russian government at a modest (for Russia) 12 percent interest
rate. Goldman's issue, truly a triumph of salesmanship, briefly per-
suaded investors that Russia'sproblems were abating. But Goldman's
motives may havebeena trifle impure. Naturally, the bank pocketed

tens of millions ofdollars in fees. Moreover, Goldman had $z5o mil-
lion in Russian loans outstanding; the new bonds enabled Russia to
pay Goldman back at a most convenient time. The century-old
vestment bank was preparing to sellstock to the public, and it pre-
ferred to have the Russian loan off its books. And Goldman, which
was hoping to gopublic in the fall, did not wait long to see if the op-
timism it had generated in Russia lingered. It quickly unloaded its
ventory of Russian bonds soas not to be stuck with the paper it had
floated to investors. '4 By the end of June, thanks to bonds issued by
Goldman as well asJ. P.Morganand I)eutsche Bank, foreign markets
were beginning to chokeon Russian paper. Interest rates on one-year
Russian bills skyrocketed to 9 \260percent.
Even in America, there were hints of a slowdown. The stock mar-
ket was suddenly volatile, and option prices jumped. Of direct sig-
nificance to Long-Term, implied w)latility rose to z7percent. Having
shorted equity vol at far lower levels, Long-Term was showing a sub-
stantial loss. Overall, in .June, the fund lost xo percent, by far its
worst month ever.Long-Termwas now down \1747 percent for the first
half of \177998--itsfirst sustained losing streak.
Salomon Smith Barney's Arbitrage Group had losses, too. Weill
had promised he would be able to live with volatile trading results,
but he couldn't. Before June was out, he decided to close the firm's
U.S. bond arbitrage operation, a business he had never liked. One
might well ask why Weill had acquired Salomon,since Arbitrage had
been its chief moneymaker. In any case, Salomon began to liquidate
assets in earnest. Of course,there was a substantial overlap between
Salomon's positions and Long-Term'strades. Thus, Salomon's selling
helped to tip Long-Term's portfolio into negative territory; arguably,
it triggered the fund's downhill spiral. Meriwether had outlasted his
creator, but it would haunt him from the grave.
Like Salomon, Long-Term had shorted a simple swap spread, a
number that is derived from the interest rate on a standard, widely
used trade. The swap rate is,at any given moment, the fixed rate that
banks, insurers, and other investors demand to bepaid in exchange
for agreeing to pay the LIBOR rate, a short-term bank rate. The twist
is that the LIBOR rate floats; no one knows where it will go in the
future. Typically, swap rates in each country trade at a slight spread
above the interest rate on the country's government debt. Thus, this
swap spread is a basic barometer of credit market anxiety; it is the

BANK OF VOLATILITY \225137
premium that investors demand for taking the risk of being exposed
\177orate fluctuations in the future.
In the United States, in April i99g , the swap spread was48basis
points. In recent historical terms, this number was high (it had been
below 35 points for most of the 199os, although, during the last re-
cession, in i99o , it had briefly spurted to 84). Long-Term,seeing
no recession on the horizon, had bet on this spread to narrow. In
Europe, Long-Term'sposition was more nuanced. The swap spread
was 45points in England and only zo in Germany, an unusually wide
gap.Therewas an economic reason for this disparity, but it seemed
to bea temporary, unnatural quirk.* Thus, in Europe, l.ong-Term bet
that the spread between the two spreads would narrow.
Both of Long-Tcrm's swap trades were intelligent convergence
plays, though not, as history had shown, sure things. The swap mar-
kct was deep and had a history that was very suitable for modeling.
But as had been the case in so many other trades, the size of Long-
Term's swap positions was unreasonably large. And as Salomon
began to liquidate its (quite similar) swap positions, Long-Term
began to lose both ways. The spread in the United States widened--
to 56points--andso did the gap between the Unitcd Kingdom's and
Germany's.
What was worse, in July, word of Sah)mon's exit from U.S. arbi-
trage became public. A memo from the brass, leaked to The Wall
.Street Journal, ominously declared, \"Opportunity for arbitrage prof-
its has lessenedover time while the risks and volatility have grown. '''\177
Naturally, traders at diverse firms began to unload interest rate swaps
as well as other arbitrage trades, for fear of being trampled by Sa-
lomon's steamroller.
The Long-Termparmcrs badly m\177derestimatcd the seriousness of
the second biggest player in their business calling it quits. They ex-
pected other arbitragcurs to fill the w\177id. When a itmior trader w/iced
concern to Eric Rosenfcld, the latter brushed him off, insisting that
the partners were on top of the situation. In luly, after Swiss Bank
and UBS merged, Siciliano visited Mcriwcthcl; who stunned Siciliano
with the news of Long-Term's recent h)sscs. But J.M., too, seemed
':In England, the government had done Imlc borrmving, leading tolower gov-
ermnent rates and wider spreads. In Germany, conversely, heavy government
borroxving had led to narrowerspreads.

confident--almost relieved. Finally, the one or two bad months he
had long been expectinghad come. The only disconcerting note was
that Long-Term had lost money on all of its trades, something J.M.
hadn't expected. But he coolly added that now the fund would take
advantageof lower prices and load up on some favorite trades. Sicil-
ian(), who had already been uneasy about Long-Term, promptly ad-
vised Felix Fischer, the chief risk officerat UBS, that the bank would
be seriously exposed if I\177ong Term's losses conti\177ued.Neither man
warned the bank's senior management.
Bear Stearns, the fund's clearing broker, also took astrong interest
in Long-Term's losses. But in July, the fund recovered. \"Since we
could see the daily P&L [profit-and-loss statement], we knew in early
July there was a significant recovery,\" noted Bear's Mike Alix. \"The
story was, they had goneback and retested all their models and come
to the conclusion that ,June was an expectedaberration. That was the
party line.\"
J.M. wascareful to personally notify Allison at Merrill Lynch and
other of the fund's big partners about the losses. He generally
sounded relaxed. Writing to investors,J.M. reported that \"future ex-
pected returns are good. '''\177Meriwether was his old selfon the golf
course, too; the losses hadn't damped his spirits. A golfing friend said
he seemed \"at peace w,ith himself.\"
The surest sign of I,o\177g-Term's conti1\177ued confidence was that the
fund continued to recruit new people. Always infatttated with new
technology, the partners hired eight ne\177v software whizzes over the
summer.The staff hit a peak of I9o.
Long-Termdid pare back its assets, intending to bring them into
line \177vith its \177ow-depleted reserves. But the total selling \177vas slight.
While Long-Term sold some directional trades, the partners were
keen on holding on to their big convergencepositions, such as equity
vol, swaps, and Royal Dutch/Shell; they also added to some posi-
tions. '\177Overall, their assets declined only to $1z8 billion from $I34
billion, and their leverage actually rose,to thirty-one times. Accord-
ing to the fund's models, Long-Term had reduced the amount it was
likely to lose on a typical trading day, from $45 million to $34 mil-
lion. '* But this was a highly mechanistic way of evaluating risk. It re-
lied on past volatilities asagaugeof the future: as usual, the partners
driving Long-Term had their eyes on the rearview mirror.
In July, the marketscontinuedto be edgy. In Russia, where fears of

devaluation had not been put to bed, yields on short-term bonds
soared to a dizzying xzo percent annual rate. However, the attitude
ofglobal investors--the plugged-in traders who were forever check-
ing CNN or Bloomberg and who seemedneverto sleep--was that
Russia was a problem, but a contained one. AsoneRussia hand non-
chalantly observed, the central bank couldeasily shut the dollar win-
dow and halt the flight of money. \"Peoplewon't care,\" he added.
\"Just some hedge funds will get hosed!
If people did not care, it was because the monetary policemenhad
beenso quick to patch any sign of trouble. In July, at Secretary
Rubin's urging, the IMF and various nations worked out a$z2.6 bil-
lion Russian bailout, seemingly demonstrating that there was no fi-
nancial problem that they couldn't fix. (Much of the bailout money
would be stolen by Russian oligarchs and siphoned out of the coun-
try.) Then Goldman Sachsinducedinvestorstoswap their short-term
Russian notes for twenty-year bonds--as if the next twenty weeks in
Russia were clear, much less the next twenty years. But investors had
stopped analyzing Russia as a credit; they were falling back on a
clich& \"Nuclear powers don't default.\" It seemed an echo of Walter
Wriston, the Citibank chairman who had n3ad\177\"loans to l,atin Amer-
ica in the \17797osand early \19778os, proclaiming that sovereign nations
didn't default.
To their credit, Travelers' Weill and I)imon smelled a rat in Russia
when others didn't. \"Sandy hated Russia,\" according to one of his
l\177ondon traders. \"He said it was lawless.\" An IMF official met with
Salomon in June and urged the bank to back Moscow,whose leader-
ship he praised. The IMF mission chief in Moscow tried a different
tack, assuring Salomon that the United States would never let a nu-
clear power default. But Weill and Dimon were uncomfortable with
being exposed to surprises,and they sensed that Russia would bring
nothing but. Though fascinated by geopolitics and Russia in particu-
lar, Weill thought it was a poor arena for an investment bank to be
laying bets in. The order went out to sell.
Once again, Long-Term and Salomon were on opposite sidesofa
trade, ftaghani and Hawkins were taken by the idea that Russia
couldn't--and simply wouldn't--let its currency fail. (Economists
weretrooping from hedge fund to hedge fund, including Long-Term,
peddling this very notion.) Long-Term knew, of course, that a defauh
was conceivable. But the professors had a model that, they believed,

forecast what would occur if Moscow did default.:\" To Haghani, this
was altogether reasonable. \"What we did is rely on experience,\" he
noted later of the portfolio in general\225 \"If you're not willing to draw
any conclusions from experience, you might as well sit on your hands
and do nothing.\"\" But could a \"model\" truly anticipate a country--
not merely its markets but its politicians, its legislators, its passions,
too? Russia wasa singularly poor laboratory for Long-Term's type of
trading\225 Less than a decade removed from communism and strug-
gling to becomea democratic society, Russia was almost inherently
unpredictable. Haghani's knowledge of history should have told him
that. (Churchill had declared in q\177939, \"I cannot forecast to you the
action of Russia. It is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an
enigma.\") In i998 , too, Russia was beyond the realm of economet-
rics, evenof the computers in Greenwich.
The Fedwas well aware of the danger ofbanks basingpredictions
too much on the past\225 In an open letter to banks, the Fed's top bank-
ing supervisor warned, \"Banks should resist any tendency to assume
\22.5. that the unusually favorable economic environment of the last
few years will continue indefinitely.\" Though the letter dealt with
commercial loans rather than capital markets, it underscored the
need to think about \"alternative scenarios\" such asbankruptcies and
defaults,rather than assume that the futurc would be a seamless ex-
tension of the present.\" In contrast to this well-founded cantion, Fed
chief Greeuspan was still singing the praises of unfettered derivative
markets\225 On July 3o, testifying before the Senate Committee on Agri-
culture, Nutrition, and Forestry, (;reenspan declared that derivative
traders \"have managed credit risks quite effectively through carcful
evalnation of counterparties.\" The words can only mean that, in
GreenspaWs view, a Merrill or a Morgan was carefully scrutinizing
clients such as lx)ng-Term--a view that wonld soon become demon-
strably false. \177
In the second half of ,]nly, l\177ong-Tcrm's performance tailed off. It
ended the month flat. Stocks in Europe and America swooned. By
early August, Russian bonds were sinking again. Rumors swirled of
selling by Wall Street banks and hedge funds. And the selling sprcad
to eastern Europe, l,atin America, and Asia. Now, Russia was not so
contained.
l)urmg the secondweekof Angust, Rnssia's markets snapped. On
August \17\7177,with dollars fleeing the country, its reserves dwindling,

itsbudget overtapped, and the price of oil, itschief commodity, down
33 percent, the government imposedcontrols on the ruble. The bank-
ing system froze for lack ofreliable and solvent banks. The Moscow
stock market briefly halted trading. It ended the day down 6
percent--and down 75percent for the year. Short-term interest rates
surgedto almostzoo percent. Long-term Russian bonds fell to half
their price of only two months earlier, when Goldman had happily
floated them.
As the world waited for a ruble devaluation, which the govern-
ment still insisted would not occur, the Communist-dominated
Duma, the lower house of Parliament, rejected reform measures
urged on it by the IME Then the members went on vacation. When
the government begged the Duma to reconvene, the members
refused--but by then many government leaders, including President
Boris Yeltsin, were also at seaside dachas, leaving the country to sort
out its misery. It was a hard thing to model.
In the United States and Europe, markets shuddered from a
swelling list of negatives: the crisis in Russia, weakness in Asia, Iraq's
refusal to permit full weapons inspections, the possibility of China
dcvaluing its currency, and President Clinton's testimony about his
relationship with a White House intern, Monica I.cwinsky. As global
investors bailed out of Russia and Asia, they furiously piled into
Treasurys, a bulwark of safety when no one wanted risk. Thirty-year
bond yields touched another new low:5.56 percent.
Naturally, credit spreads kept widening. Since April, the high point
for bond arbitrage, A-rated bonds had moved from 6o points over
Treasurys to 9\260points. U.S. swap spreads were rising, too. At every
Wall Street bank, arbitrage desks were cutting back; capital was flee-
ing from bond arbitrage just as it had fled from Asia. The Fed, at
first, had been favorably disposed toward thc trend. Spreads had
been tight, credit too easy. But now, in the c\177mtcxt \177fRussia's melt-
down, the Fed'snerveswere on edge.
\225
Long-Term was losing money m August--disturbingly, for the third
month in four. The partners could no hmgcr beso standoffish toward
Wall Street. Realizing that Salomon, which was continuing to liqui-
date, was a major headache, Haghani offered to buy the bank's whole
position, worth about $z billion\177just to freezeit. Salomon'speople

thought he wasjoking--Long-Term no longer had the capital to back
suchboldtalk--but Salomon's traders enjoyed the turnabout in their
respective fortunes: Long-Term wasn't calling the shots anymore.
Robert Shustak, Long-Term'schief financial officer, was having to
field calls every day from a worried Bear Stearns. J. P. Morgan heard
rumors that Long-Term was liquidating positions--or at least trying
to. Lehman Brothers heard the rumors, to(). Though I,ong-Term had
oncesnubbed the smallish investment bank, now it was making nice
with Lehman. \"They were coming to us to domorebusiness,\" Jeffrey
Vanderbeek, head of fixed incomeat Lehman,recalled. \"I remember
thinking that their liquidity might be drying up. They wanted more
financing.\" As repo loans were rolling over, Wall Street banks,
Lehmanamong them, were finally asking the professors for margin.
Suddenly anxious about their personal well-being, the partners
made hurried calls to their advisers and attorneys. Hans Hufschmid,
a London partner who was married to a Californian, was about to
bid on a house in Malibu. But Hufschmid, who had borrowed heav-
ily to invest in Long-Term, got a case of nerves. On a hunch, he de-
cided not to buy the house. Myron Scholesdid buy a four-story home
in San Francisco, where his fianceelived. It was a fantastic home on
Russian Hill, with high ceilings and a terrace overlooking Fisher-
man's Wharf. It cost $6.5 million. :\177But then, Scholes had moneyout-
side the fund. And the fund's lossesso far had hardly been severe.
Meriwether confidently went ahead with a trip to China in the
middle of August. The partners thought they had reason to be opti-
mistic; spreads had widened so much, they felt, that now, surely, they
could only narrow. But their optimism had a desperate edge. In mid-
August, Long-Term jumped more heavily into Russia, where it al-
ready owned hedged Russian bonds as well as some that were
unhedged. Now, while the entire world was watching Russia, while
its finances were in shambles and its government on hold, Haghani
and a researcher named Ayman Hindy, a former professor at Stan-
ford, bought more Russian bonds as though they had the inside scoop
on that enigmatic Eastern riddle. Neither the Nobel Prize nor all the
degreesmattered now; the professors were rolling the dice. Accord-
ing to one trader at Long-Term, the fund went \"outright long in
Russia--right at the end.\" Saidanother, miserably, \"It was so against
our
way.\"

firm, often gave rise to the very term \"genius.\" Long-Term was un-
known to the general public, but that is how Meriwether and his
boys wanted it, and that, of course, is how they expected the fund to
remain.Theycould hardly have had a glimmer of the large, even his-

and most highly esteemed investors. Their fuud had $3.6 billion in
capital, of which two fifths was personally theirs. It would take only
five weeks for them to lose it all.

144 \" WHEN GENIUS FAILED
On Monday, August 17, Russia declared a debt moratorium. The
government simply decided it ,vould rather use its rubles to pay Rus-
sian workers than Western bondholders. Nor would it attempt to
maintain the value of those rubles in foreign markets. In short, it was
a devaluation and, on at leastsome of its borrowings, a default from
a government that had promised that it would do neither. Enigmatic
to the end, Russia said its moratorium would apply to $13.5 billion
of local (ruble) debt--breaking the rule, honored even in the depths
of the Latin American debt crisis, that a government honors its own
coin.
Thereaction in markets was muted, at leastat first. Mexican and
Brazilian bonds fell, and stocks in Japan and various emerging mar-
ketsweakened. But the Dow rose nearly \1757\260points. American banks,
honoring a tradition that extended back to \17792.9, quickly declared
that they expected to weather the storm with little ill effect. Robert
Strong, chief credit officer at Chase Manhattan, whose stock price
was to fall 5\260percent within six weeks, confidently proclaimed to
Wall Street security analysts, \"I do not view Russia asamajor issue\"
for Chase or for other U.S.banks.' In terms of its total indebtedness,
Russia was no big deal, barely another Venezuela.
Except that Russia was not Venezuela. Supposedly, nuclear powers
did not default. And when Russia did, something in the markets died.
The comforting notion that the global financial cops would always be
there to put matters right was now exposed as a fallacy. This time,
there was no rescue by the IMF, no hurried bailout by Robert Rubin
or the Group of Seven Western powers. \"The fund and the G7 finally
managed to say no,\" remarked Morris Goldstein, a former senior
IMF official.\177' The implications of this truth chilled global markets
like a Siberian gale.The default shattered the lazy but convenientas-
sumptions of investors that the safety net would always be there. It
\"punctured a moral hazard bubble ''\177that had been inflating expecta-
tions since Rubin had ridden to the rescue of Mexico. Investors, at
first singly and then en masse, concluded that no emerging market
was safe. In seventy years, Russia's Communists had not succeeded in
dealing markets such a telling blow asdid its deadbeat capitalists.
On Thursday, three days after the default, markets around the
world buckled. Shares in eastern Europe and Turkey were weak. The
stock market in Caracas plunged 9.5 percent. Venezuelans panicked
and rushedto buy dollars. Brazil's far larger bolsa was off6percent.

THE FALL
Germany's stock market fell 2 percent, as if the Russian menace could
actually tramp across the eastern front.
Investors now were running not just from emerging markets, but
from investment risk wherever it lurked. The panic proved that the
Asian storm had never truly been forgotten. Swap spreads--those
basicthermometers of credit markets--rose like a dangerous fever.
The British bank Barclays ordered its traders to unload short posi-
tions in U.K. swaps, even though its traders, like those at Long-Term,
thought swaps were unreasonably high. Barclays'decision to aban-
don the trade merely pushed them higher. ': Barclays' management
didn't care. The bank wanted out. It was done with taking risk.
The next day, Friday, August 2r, traders everywherewanted out.
Stock markets in Asia and in Europe plunged. The Dow fell 280
points before noon, then recouped most of its losses.This palpable
surge in volatility cost Long-Termseveral tens of millions of dollars.
Thedamage to credit markets was far worse. Treasurysrallied, but
it was a rally driven by panic, for investors bought Treasurys to get
out of inferior credits. A few months before, they had not distin-
guished one risk from the next. Now it was all they thought of. A
rose-colored world had suddenly gone dark, discolored by Russia,
Japan, even the Clinton-I\177ewinsky scandal. In every market, investors
wanted only the safest bond. In the Uuited States, it had to be the
thirty-year Treasury; m Germany, the ten-year Bund. All over the
world, people were buying safer (lower-yielding) bonds and selling
riskier (higher-yielding) ones, pushing the spreads between such bond
pairs everwider. Minute by minute, Long-Term was losing millions.
\225
h3 Greenwich, on that golden latc\177August Friday, l.ong-Term's office
was largely deserted. Most of the seniorparmers were on vacation; it
was a sultry morning, and the staff was moving slowly. Jim McEntee,
the colorful \"sheik\" whose doleful warnings had bccn ignored,was
minding the store. Bill Kraskcr, the parmcF who had coustructed
many of the firm's models, was anxiously monitoring lnarkets, click-
ing from one phosphorescentpage to the uc\327t. Krasker clicked from
governments to mortgagesto foreign debt, the entire atlas of credit.
;\"To exit a short position,a trader mUSl buy back histrade; thus, the effect is

When he saw the quotation for U.S. swap spreads, he stared at his
screen in disbelief. On an active day, Krasker knew, U.S. swap
spreads might change by as much as a point. But on this morning,
swap spreads were wildly oscillating over a range of 2o points. They
ended an astonishing 9 points higher, at 76, up from 48 in April. In
Britain it was the same story: swapspreads surged to 6,-, a dozen
points wider than they had been in July.
Krasker couldn't believeit.He sought out Matt Zames, a trader,
and Mike Reisman, the firm's repo man, and heatedly broke the
news. One of the staffers grimacedand said, \"Holy shit.\" The traders
hadn't seen a move like that--ever. True, it had happened in \177987
and again in \17799\"-. But Long-Term's models didn't go back that far.
As far as Long-Term knew, it was a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence--a
practical impossibility\177--and one for which the fund was totally un-
prepared. One of the analysts called a trader at home and asked,
\"Would you like to guess where swap spreads are?\" When the ana-
lyst told him, the trader snapped, \"Fuck you--don't evercall me at
home again!\"
That Friday, Long-Term lost money wherever it looked. Credit
spreads simply exploded.Mortgagespreads surged to izi points, up
from to 7 only weeks before. High-yield bonds climbed from 2,69
to z76. Off-the-run Treasurys vaulted from 8 basis points to i3!
Though these moves may seem small in absolute terms, the effect on
Long-Termwas magnified by the fund's potent levelof leverage and
its immense position size.
Even in seemingly unrelated markets, l.ong-]\177'rm suffered a drub-
bing. Theriskier Russian and Brazilian bonds that Long-Termowned
plunged, and by far more than the safer Russian and Brazilian bonds
that it had sold short as the hedges that were supposed to have made
its bets so safe. In fact, nothing in any market went right that day.
Long-Term had dubiously invested in Ciena Corporation, a telecom-
munications company that was planning to merge with Tellabs Inc.,
and had continued to hold the stock even when it had crept to within
'-5 cents of the acquisition price. On that same Friday, August z \177t,he
merger was postponed and Ciena stock plummeted $z5.5o, to
$3t.z5ashare. Long-Term lost $\1757\260million. Years earlier, Rosenfcld
had been warned that risk arbitrage was like picking up nickels m
front ofoncoming bulldozers.One had fmatly nipped him.
The lossescame from every corner. They were so swift, so ency-

clopedic in their breadth, so utterly unexpected that the partners felt
abandoned. They had suddenly lost control,as though the gods of
science had been dislodged and some unseen diabolical power had
taken hold of their fates. In Greenwich, the skeletoncrew frantically
called around the globe to reach the other partners. Victor Haghani
was in Italy; he hurried back to London. Eric Rosenfeldhad iust ar-
rived in Sun Valley, Idaho, for a two-week vacation with his family.
He got a red-eyeback to New York. Meriwether was in China. His
partners tracked him down at a dinner in Beiiing, and the boss took
the next flight home. Before he left, J.M. called Jon Corzine, the chief
executive of Goldman Sachs,a major Long-Term trading partner, at
Corzine's home. \"We've had a serious markdown,\" Meriwether ad-
vised him, \"but everything is fine with us.'\"
But everything was not fine. Long-Term, which had calculated
with such mathematical certainty that it was unlikely to lose more
than $35 million on any single day, had just dropped $55\177; million--
\1757percent of its capital--on that one Friday in August. It had started
the year with $4.67 billion. Suddenly, it was down to Lg2.9 billion.
Since the end of April, it had lost more than a third of its equity.
Worried by such serious lossesto a major client, Mike Alix, the
BearStearns executive who monitored credit risks, hurricdlv called
Robert Shustak, l,ong-Tcrm\177s chief financial officer. Shustak patiently
went over the firm's liquidity. Alix was amazed by Shnstak's calm, a
thought that was to come to Alix often in the weeks ahead about
Shustak and abont the other partners. Theywere true poker players,
Alix thonght.\"
Twodaysafter the debacle, on Sunday, August 23, the partners as-
sembled in the conference room at 7 A.M. Outside the glass-and-
granite headquarters, a fountain spewed jets of water overasculpture
of a copper osprey. As if stricken bv a premonition, Merixvether had
summoned Jim Rickards, the generalcounsel, to advise the group and
alsokeep a record of the proceedings. Having been blmdsidcd by the
Mozerscandal,J.M. knew from bitter experience that oncesuch mat-
ters became public, it was too late to seek advice. From that Sunday
on, whenever the partners met, Rickards, a laxvyer with degrees from
Penn, Johns Hopkins, and New York University, xw\177sahnost always
in attendance.
J.M. had each trader report on his area ofexpertise: Hilibrand on

from London) on U.K.swaps and Royal Dutch/Shell. Disturbingly,
the traders said there was no demand for Long-Term'strades,despite
their seeming soundness. The Tokyo partners reported a similar
story: there simply weren't any buyers.- In such a climate, there was
no way Long-Term could get out of its humongous trades without
moving the markets even more. The partners had assumed that other
arbitrageurs would recognize the values that they saw; their failure to
step forward mystified them. \17N7ow, like gellerals who overcommitto
a distant war, they found the road out blocked.
Instinctively, Meriwether and the other seniorpartners gravitated
toward the same strategy: they would raise fresh capital to give the
firm a cushion and wait until its trades turned around. They were cer-
tain that spreads would eventually converge, just as they had when a
young J.M. had daringly bailed out Eckstein. His early heroics had
been an almost faultless guide to J.M.'s career:Spreads always come
back.
But owing to its loss of capital, Long-Term's leveragehad become
dangerously high--dangerous because losses accumulate faster as
leverageincreases Th. erefore, to reduce their risk, the partners would
have to sell something. But what? Investors wanted only the least
risky bonds, and Long-Term didn't own any. One candidate was
merger arbitrage. I.ong-Term's deal portfolio had mushroomed to
a stunning $5 billion worth of merger positions,\" including Citi-
corp/Travelers and MCl/WorldCom (the latter a successor to MCI's
never-consummated union with British Telecommunications). The
partners thought most of these marriages would go through (as, in-
deed, they did). But they were hardly ceutral to the fund's portfolio.
And if all of them did collapse,as the Ciena merger had, Long-Term
calculated that it could lose more than half a billion dollars--now an
intolerable risk. '\177'
That same Sunday night, Rosenfeldcalled Warren Buffett, reach-
ing him at his home in Omaha. Rosenfeld had won Buffett's admira-
tion in \17979 \17a7fter the Mozer scandal, whe\177 he bad worked diligently
to get Salomonpast the crisis, helping also to restore its name. Now
Rosenfeld figured there was no one better to offer l.o\177g-Term's
merger portfolio to than Buffett. The billionaire liked to deal in size.
He had done risk arbitrage before. And thanks to widening deal
spreads, prices were attractive.
Buffett listened attentively. But he quickly noted that he hadn't

been involved in merger arbitrage in a while and wasn't up to speed.
No sale. Graciously,heasked if there was anything else he could do.
Rosenfeld couldn't think of anything. \177'
The next day, August z4, the partners started dialing for dollars.
With their gilt-edged roster of contacts, their brilliant record, their
lustrous reputations, no modern Croesus was beyond their reach.
Greg Hawkins tapped a friend in George Soros's fund and set up a
breakfast for Meriwether,Soros, and Stanley Druckenmiller, the bil-
lionaire'stop strategist. Soros, a wily refugee from Communist Hun-
garB and Meriwether wereas different as could be. Soros's Eastern
European originsoozed from his every pore. Formal and stiff, he had
a tendency to \177aunch into philosophical disquisitions. He looked like
a graying owl. Meriwether was informal, unpretentious, mid\177vcstern;
he could have been the State Farm agent down the street. They rep-
resented unlike styles in investing, too. Long-Termenvisioned mar-
kets as stable systems in which prices moved about a centra\177 point of
rational equilibrium. \"1 had a different view,\" Soros noted. \177T'he
speculator saw markets asorgan{c and unpredictable. He felt they in-
teracted with, and were reflective of, ongoing events. They were
hardly sterile or abstract systems. As he explained it, \"'Theidea that
you have a bell-shape curve is false. You have outlying phenomena
that you can't anticipate on the basis of previousexperience.\" Rus-
sia, where Soros's funds had just lost $z billion, was an example of
just such an \"outlying phenomenon\" that lay outside the professors'
curves.
\225
Meriwether argued, calmly but persuasively, that Long-Term's mar-
kets would snap back; for those with deep pockets, the opportunities
weregreat.Soros listened impassively, but Druckcnmiller peppered
J.M. with questions. He smelled a chance to recoup Soros's Russian
losses in a hurry. Then, Soros N\177ldly said he would be willing to in-
vest $500 million at the end of August--that is, a week later--pro-
vided that Long-Term could rcstorc its capital by raising another
$500 million in addition.
Now Rosenfeld calledJ. P. Morgan, a firm that long had thirsted
for closer ties to Greenwich.The bank sent two teams--one versed in
bonds, the other in equities--to comb through Long-Term's books.
From then on, Morganpeople and Long-Term people were talking

almost constantly about how to salvage various of Long-Term'sposi-
tions.\" Naturally, Long-Term turned for help to Roberto Mendoza,
the Morgan vice chairman to whom it had offered a partnership.
Though close to the partners, especiallyMerton, Mullins, and Rosen-
fold, Mendoza had had no idea that l.ong-Term was in serious trou-
ble. Rosenfeld told him, \"We need a large amount of money.\" His
bhmmess shocked Mendoza. Understandably, the banker wanted to
know a little something about l.ong-Term's portfolio.J.M. asked
Hilibrand to explain the swap position to Mendoza, but the wary
Hilibrand refused. Almost in tears, Hilibrand spluttered that he
couldn't say a word about his precious portfolio. He had been so
certain--he had borrowed so freely. Now his tightly ordered world
was beginning to crack. Personal bankruptcy was not out of the ques-
tion. The possibility that he had been so wrong was devastating.
But this time,J.M.insisted: Hilibrand would have to disclose a lit-
tle something. The arbitrageur grudgingly complied. Mendoza, the
partners' friend, loyally promised that Morgan (or its clients) would
be good for $zoo million. Now Long-Term needed $300 million
more; it did not seemso much. Rickards, the house lawyer, drafted
papers foran
imminent closing.
On Tuesday, August zS, Meriwether made two more calls. One
was to Herb Allison, the Merrill president. Ordinarily, the two would
have been chatting about the upcoming trip to Waterville, but this
September there would be no golf weekend.J.M. disclosed that the
fund's capital had fallen to $2. 7 billion. Hestressed that Long-Term
had plenty of liquidity and, indeed, that liquidity wasn't an issue--an
assertion that, even if sincere, was naively at odds with the fund's es-
calating leverage. J.M. still believed in the models, and the models
were still flashing bullish signals.
Nonetheless, J.M. noted, Long-Term would have to report its
losses to investors at the end of the month; he would feel better if he
could show them that new money was coming in. Smoothly switch-
ing gears, he emphasized the splendid opportunity for anyone who
invested now. Playing his trump card, he implied that a big investor--
Allison guessed he meant Soros--was already in. Perhaps Merrill
would like to join him and commit,say,$3oo million to $5oo million
before the end of August? Though fond of Meriwether, Allison
thought it was a curious invitation. It was a lot of moneyto be want-
ing in a week.

THE FALL \225151
J.M.'s other call that day was to Jamie Dimon at Travelers, the
parent of Salomon Smith Barney. Instead of the two firms pecking
each other to death by liquidating arbitrage trades, he suggested, why
\177lotunite Long-Term's portfolio with what was left of Salomon's Ar-
bitrage Group and manage them together? Going back to the mother
firm, in a sense. A couple of J.M.'s partners calledSalomon,too,so-
liciting their old friends for capital.Theysaid that the fund needed $ \177
billion but was well on the way toward getting it.
But Long-Term was losing ground, not gaining it. Markets were
steadily turning on the fund. Mortgage spreads jumped an additional
4 points that Monday, 6 more on Tuesday,and 3 more on Wednes-
day, August z6. High-yield spreads blcw out another z5 points. With
each tick, more of Long-Term's once abundant capital drained
away--the firm was losing money faster than it could raise it.
Stunned by the unceasing losses and helplessto do anything about
them, its traders werebecomingdazed, like infantry in a slaughter. \"It
was bizarre,\" one of them said. \"Day after day we had massive
losses, and they didn't stop.\" The firm was hemorrhaging.
Long-Term knew it had to reduce its positions, but it couldn't--
not with markets under stress. Despite the ballyhooed growth in de-
rivatives, there was no liquidity in credit markets. Thcre never is
when everyone wants out at the santo time. This is what the models
had missed. When losses mount, leveraged investors such as Long-
Termare forced to sell, lest their losses overwhelm them. Whe\177a firm
has to sell in a market without buyers, prices run to the extremes be-
yond the bell curve. To take just one example, yields on News Cor-
poration bonds, which had recently been trading at IIO points over
Treasurys, bizarrely soared to i8o over, even though the company's
prospects had not changed one iota. In the long run, such a spread
might seem absurd. But long-term thinking is a luxury not always
available to the highly leveragcd; they may not survive that long.
The end of August is always a slow time in markets, but this Au-
gust, trading in bond markets all but vanished. The market for new
bond issues simply dried up. Scheduled new offerings were abruptly
withdrawn, which was just as well, becausetherewas no one to buy
them. Thelesser investors, the copycats, the fashionable hedge funds,
the newcomers to arbitrage, and the smaller,European-based traders
were quitting the spread-trading businessor withdrawing their capi-
tal from it in droves. '4

Wary of their clients' mounting losses, banks were finally tighten-
ing their credit lines to hedgefunds. Steve Freidheim, the hedge fund
manager at BankersTrust,was getting margin calls. His loan brokers
had changed their tune. Once they had shoveled money at him; now
they were demanding more margin. Freidheimwatched in horror as
the value of his bonds sank beneath the value of the loans against
them. Since many of his bonds were unsalable, Freidheim sold other
credits--Brazil, Turkey, Thailand, U.S. mortgage securities, high-
yield bonds. It didn't matter what he sold; the point was, he had to
sellsomething. At such a time, capital naturally flows from riskier as-
setsto less risky ones, irrespective of their underlying value. To a tiny
degree, Freidheim'sownactions made it do so. Multiplied by a thou-
sand other Freidheims all over Wall Street, the crisisof fear became a
self-fulfilling prophecy, just as Merton's father, who had coined the
phrase, had theorized. As pricesfell,banks backed away from hedge
funds. And asbanks backed away, hedge funds had to keepselling.
Sandy Weill, far from wanting to partner with Long-Term or any-
one else in arbitrage, was telling his troops to lower their exposure m
hedge funds. Even as its own traders were liquidating assets,Salomon
was reeling from losses in bond arbitrage as well as in Russia. Weill
is said to have ordered his minions to reduce the number of hedge
funds doing business with Salomon from five hundred to twenty!
Weill's buddy Warren Buffett was monitoring his people, demanding
to hear, in very detailed terms,about Berkshire Hathaway's exposure
to hedge funds. Buffett, who instinctively tightened his grip on his
company's cash when times got tough, wanted to know if a Berkshire
insurance subsidiary was holding adequate collateral on swap
trades.*\177
Goldman Sachs was nervous about its exposure to swaps, particu-
larly with Long-Term. When Corzine, who had beenjarred by J.M.'s
call from China, calledMeriwether back, he warned him, \"We aren't
getting adequate feedback. It could hurt your credit standing.\" Gold-
man was trying to pry information loose from the always tight-lipped
hedge fund, but Long-Term was still reluctant to share information.
It was trying to operate onabusiness-as-usuablasis. But the firm no
longer had the capital to dictate terms willy-nilly. Under pressure
from Goldman and otherbanks,knowledge of Long-Term's positions
was slowly leaking out.
Now it was Wednesday, August z6, and Merrill's Allison called to

',ay no dice. Still in the dark, Allison added, \"John, I'm not sure it's

losses there. A trendy investor in ruble debt, the appropriately named
Iligh Risk Opportunities Fund, run by 111 Offshore Advisors of West
Palm Beach,Florida,waswipedout. William McDonough, president
of the New York Fed, hurriedly canceled his trip to Jackson Hole,
Wyoming, where the Fed was holding its annual late-summer retreat.
With bears on the prowl, McDonough had no time for moose.
Increasingly desperate, Mcriwether and Rosenfeld placed another
call to Buffett.\" Some of the partners had never forgiven Buffett for,
in their cyes, riding Meriwether out of Salomon. They resented the
folksy billionaire's tendency to preach, particularly since he liked to
heap disdain on academicmodels, which he eschewed in favor of his
simple buy-and-hold approach to common stocks. \177A-s wc have seen,
l.ong-Term's partners had even shorted Bcrkshire, an arbitragc on
which they had lost about $\1775o million. But Buffett and the partners
still respected each other as talented investors, albeit from different
schools. And now Long-term needed moneBand no one in America
save for Bill Gates had more of it than Buffett.
Buffett agreed to seeHilibrand, who flcw out to Omaha on Thurs-
day, August z7. By now, the firm's capital was down to $e. \177billion.
The morning's New York 77rues intoned, \"'Thc markct turlnoil is

By the time Hilibrand was airborne, he k\177cw that stocks in \177lbkyo

a world recession, touched a twenty-one-year low. The next day's
Wall Street .lournal would call it a \"global margin call.''-''' Everyone
wanted his money back. Burned by foolish speculation in Russia, in-
vestorswere rejecting risk in any guise, evenreasonablerisk. Yields
on long-term Treasurys fell to 5.35 percent, the lowestsince Lyndon
Johnson was president. Yields on single-A credits--issued by the
blue-chip Ford Motors of the world--soared to \17\71757 over Treasurys,
though Ford was no less safe a credit than in April, when it had
traded at aspread of only 6o. Investors wanted safety; moreover, they
wanted the peace of mind that safer bonds delivered, no matter the
price.
Buffett met Hilibrand at the airport that Thursday and escorted
him back to his office, a modest suite in a pale high-rise across the
street from a pizzeria. Hilibrand was his usual methodical self. He
was candid about gong-Term's losses but totally controlled. He did
not strike Buffett as desperate.The arbitrageur went over his battered
portfolio in detail. Hilibrand stressed that he saw great potential
going forward--given his personal debts, he had little choice. But
Long-Term was in a hurry to raise money, Hilibrand said, and thus
he offeredto cut the fund's usual fee in half.
This was hardly enough for Buffett. In his opinion, Long-Term's
fees had been too high as they were. -'\17I7n any case, he had little inter-
est, at least for now. Buffett said thanks, but no thanks.
When Hilibrand left and called Greenwich, the news was even
worse. The fund had lost $z77 million Thursday--its second worst
day ever. Its capital was down to \243'_\177.le\177illiom For four years, the
brain trust in Greenwich had made money faster than anyone else.
Now, like a movie that revealsan unsuspected horror on rewind, they
were losing it incomparably faster. And then the unthinkable hap-
pened. On the next day, Frida.v, August zS, Long-Term earned a
profit. Credit spreads narrowed, and the fund's capital rose by $\177z8
million--its first substantial up day in months. The partners nour-
ished a tiny hope that the long-awaited turn xvas at hand.
But the partners had another worry, aside from the fund, that re-
quired fast attention: I.TCM, their personally owned management
company, was facing serious cash flow problems. LTCMowed a total
of $I65 million to a group of banks--Fleet, Credit Eyonnais, Chase
Manhattan, and Lloyds. By late August, the banks, especiallyFleet,
were screaming that the fund's poor performance constituted an

,-vcnt of default and that, therefore, the banks were entitled to de-
,uand repayment. But the management company didn't have the
,\177sh--most of the money had beenpoured into the fund to heighten
\177hcpartners' investment. Effectively, the management company was
, h\177seto being insolvent. If that fact became public, both the firm and
Ihc fund could face a debilitating spiral.
Someof the partners, including Hans Hufschmid, who was wor-
,it'd about his personal debt, thought LTCM should simply sell some
of its stake in the fund and pay off the banks. But Rickards, the
lawyer, properly warned that if insiders took out money now, when
Ihe outside investors had no such option, it could look very bad later.
Meriwether, who did not want a second censure from the SEC,
agreed. Moreover, he realized that he could scarcely ask others for
new investment if the partners werecashingout. For better or worse,
the partners' money would have to stay in the fund.
And the fund (as distinct from LTCM) had cash flow worries, too.
As August trickled away, the partners were feeling pressure from Bear
Stearns, the fund's clearing broker, which was nervously eyeing the
drop in Long-Term's equity. Thanks to Hilibrand's hardball negotiat-
ing tactics, the fund and Bearhad neversignedan agreement, mean-
mg that Bear was freeto stop clearing its trades whenever it pleased.
Thus, Hilibrand's tactics had misfired, for l\177ong-]\177'rm now was at
Bear's mercy.
One strategy for freeing cash was to pair the trades that Long-
Term had done with separate banks. Because none of its banks had
the whole picture, none saw that most of its trades were hedged and
tended to offset one another; therefore, eachwas demanding more
margin than it otherwise would have. Long-Term was trying to move
pairsoftrades to thc same house, but the job was overwhelming: the
fund had a mind-boggling sixty thousand individual positions.\177'\"
Long-Term's earlier diffidence had bccomca liability (the problem
of pairing trades wouldn't have arisen lint for Ililibrand's earlier in-
sistence on keeping banks in the dark). Ililibrand and the other
traders had gotten away with being secretive and evenarrogant when
the fund was on top, but now their smug superiority was coming
backto haunt them. Long-Term was having to plead for leniency to
the very banks that it had offended. And the partners were tortured
by the memory of having returned--despite the Sheik's strenuous
objections--$z. 7 billion to investors. Worse, they had fi)rced their in-

vcstors to take it!That money would have solved their problems, but
of course, the investors wereno longerenamored of Long-Term, nor
were they begging to reinvest. What's more, manv of the banks were
themselves under stress. This is a timeless irony: when you need
money most, the most likely sources of it (in Long-Term's case, other
operators suchasSoros a, s well as investment banks and institutions)
arc likely to be hurting as well.
The partners began to sense that they might not make it. Theirex-
quisitely wrought experiment in risk management, to say nothing of
their fabulous profits, was in danger of unraveling. \"We were des-
perate at the end of August,\" Rosenfeldadmitted.Their tone changed
to disbelief and bitterness at having left themselves exposed to such
needless humiliation. They were much too rich to have gotten into so
much trouble. Modest, the newest partner, lamented that his part-
nership was virtually worthless.
In another sign of their growing desperation, the parmers scram-
bledtokeep their personal assets from being contaminated by Long-
Term's troubles. Hilibrand, once worth half a billion dollars, was
paying for the work on his extravagant new mansion out of his
wife's checking account. Mcriwcthcr quietly maneuvered to protect
himself from the nauseating specter of creditors. He signedover his
only real estate property--a twenty-acre lot m tony Pebble Beach,
California--to his wife (his Westchester estate was already m Mimi's
name).';
Badly in need of a lift, Meriwether called an old friend, Vmny
Mattone, who had been the fund's first contact at BearStearns. Mat-
tone, who had retired, was everything that ,].M.'s elegant professors
wercnot.He wore a gold chain and a pinkie ring, and he showed up
at Long-Term in a black silk shirt, open at the chest.Helooked as if
he weighed three hundred pounds. Unlike J.M.'s strangely wooden
partners, Mattone saw markets as exquisitely human institutions--
inherently volatile, ever-fallible.
\"Where are you?\" Mattone asked bhmtly.
\"We're down by half,\" Meriwether said.
\"You're finished,\" Mattone replied, as if this conclusion needed no
explanation.
For the first time, Meriwether sounded worried. \"What are you
talking about? We still have two billion. We have half--we have
\177oros.\"

Nlattone s\177niled sadly. \"When you're down by half, people figure

.\177'\177ainstyou. They're not going to roll [refinance[ your trades. You're
/m\177shed.'\"
Not long after Mattone's visit, Meriwcther and McEntee went for
., drink at a local inn favored by J.M. and other transplanted Wall
'\177treeters. Sipping his trademark gin a\177d tonic, Meriwether looked at
his pal and said in a voice that was completely flat, \"You were right.\"
Ilw Sheik looked at him. \"I should have listened to you,\" J.M. said.
\225
()utsiders would later comment o\177boxv thc group held together, but
it was their only palatable choice. Thedeeper their fix, the less the
partners wanted to be with anyone else and the more they closed
ranks.Theysuppressed fo, r the moment, their resentments and bitter
dislikes; they aw)ided recriminations and blame. Grim and deter-
mined, they got to the office at dawn and worked late into night, as
if their physical presencealone could stop the hemorrhaging. They
stayed on the phone forhours, trying to liquidate trades, stroking old
investors, seducing new ones, fending off bankers. Rosenfeld and
l,eahy tried to keep up morale. They told the staff, \"We'regoingto
be fine. We have z\17l7ot of liquidity. We're raising new money. We just
have to be smaller--we have too much risk.\" The partners continu-
ally retreated to the conference room, always with the curtains drawn
to block out prying eyes, to hash out their problems in secret. Their
meetingsseemedendless W. hen they exited, a staffer might plead for
a bit of news. But the partners barely responded, not evento their
own employees. The tightly wound Hilibrand would brush right by
as though he didn't hear.
\225
By the final weekend in August, l,ong;lerm was further than ever
from meeting Soros's terms,and mosteverybodyon Wall Street who
had the power to write a check was out of town for the end of sum-
mer.Long-Term had lost scores of millions or hundreds of millions of
dollars day after day, every single day for weeks--until, finally, it had
enjoyed that single up day on Friday. Still hoping against hope, Meri-
wether made yet another round of calls.
Onewas to Merrill's Dan Napoli, to ask when Napoli thought the

bleeding would stop--as if Napoli or anyone else could know. Then
J.M. called Siciliano, reaching the UBS manager in Tokyo.
\"Doesanyone in your bank want to invest?\" Meriwether queried.
\"These trades aremispriced. We think we have a tremendous oppor-
tunity.\" Keeping his composure, J.M. added that l,ong-Term believed
it had up to $t billion in other new money virtually sewed up.
UBS, though, was already l\177ong-Term's biggest investor. \"You
must bedown twenty-five percent,\" Siciliano said.
J.M. repliedcoolly, \"More like forty-five percent.\"
Siciliano was stunned. He wondered who would want to risk
putting in the first billion. He knew it wouldn't be he.
On Saturday, August z9, Meriwether called Edson Mitchell, the
Merrill Lynch banker who had spearheaded Long-Term's maiden
fund-raising effort in \177993. Mitchell had since moved to London to
launch a global bond business for DeutscheBank.Could Mitchell
and Deutsche raise capital for Long-Termnow?
Mitchell said it was unlikely.
Meriwether was running out of friends. When you need money,
Wall Street is a heartlessplace.
On Monday, August 3\177,as the month ran out, the Hong Kong
Monetary Authority, which had been buying shares of localstocks,
suddenly stopped supporting the market. Yet another safety net had
beenexposedas porous. The local bourse tumbled 7 percent, trig-
gering a run on Wall Street. The Dow crashed 5 \17z7 points, a 6 percent
plunge that took the average down to 7,539. It had fallen \1779percent
since mid-July. Secretary Rubin, back from salmon fishing in Alaska,
tried to calm markets by declaring that the U.S. economy was
\"sound.\" This merely deepened the mystery of the crash, for no one
piece of news was responsible. The Wall Street Journal cited a \"dis-
appointing Chicago purchasing managers index, '\177an almost comi-
cally trivial explanation. The paperwascloser to the truth when it
noted, \"On the margin, there is no incremental buyer. ''\177\1T77he Main
Street economy wassound, but financial markets were overleveraged
and overextended. The entire Street had lost its nerve. The cool, un-
emotionaltraders of Merton's models no longer existed, if they ever

The damage in Long-Term's markets was acute. Equity volatility
broke above 3 \260percent. Yields on Treasurys dropped, widening
credit spreads ever more. Spreads on investment-grade bonds ex-

ploded upward--on that oneday--from 133 points to I6z! In truth,
such spreadshadto be inferred, because almost nothing in bond mar-
kets traded that day. The bond market had effectively closed;noone
could trade out of anything, or not without suffering horrendous
losses. It was as if a bomb had hit; traders looked at their screens, and
the screensstared blankly back. Buyers were simply nowhere to be
found. \"August thirty-first was a unique day,\" said Curtis Sham-
baugh, the bond strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston. \"So few is-
suestraded, you had to guess where they were.\" For a fund that had
to lighten its load, the month had ended with the most nightmarish
kind ofbond market imaginable: no bond market at all.
\225
August was the worst month cver recorded in credit spreads.\" In the
past, such ballooning spreads had presaged an economic collapse.
But this time, no depression threatened Main Street; perhaps a sh)w-
down, but nothing more. The bond marketcollapsewascaused by a
panic not in the mainstream economy but on Wall Street itself, where
too much optimism (andtoo much leverage) had suddenly come un-
done.
Three quarters of all hedge funds lost money in August, and Long-
Ferm did the worst of any of them. In one dreadful month, Meri-
wether'sgang lost $\177.9 billion, or 45 percentof its capital, leaving it
with only $2.28 billion.TheSoros opportunity was gone--hopelessly
gone. And Long-Term'sportfolio still was dangerously bloated. The
fund had $IZ 5 billion in assets--98 percent of its prior total and an
extraordinary fifty-five times its now-shrunken equity--in addition
to the massive leverage in its derivativebets, such as equity volatility
and swap spreads. This leverage was simply untenable. If its assets
continued to fall, its losseswould eat through that $z.z8 billion sliver
of equity in an eye blink. Yet that leverage could not bereduced--not
given the size of the tradesand the utter loss of liquidity.
The partners were in an unfamiliar place, a territory the modelers
hadn't explored. Stavis felt the partners had gotten to \"a kind of
volatility they didn't understand.\" Theoretically, the odds against a
loss such as August's had been prohibitive; such a debacle was, ac
cording to the mathematicians, an event so freakish as to be unlikely
to occurevenonce over the entire life of the Universe and even owr
numerous repetitions of the Universe. > But it had happened to

Term not quite four years after Meriwether had written to the firm's
investors, confidently endorsing Merton and Scholes's so finely tuned
assumptions about the fund's risks. Alas, in the partners' lingo, the
\"correlations [among the trades] had gone to one.\" Every bet was
losing simultaneously. Thedice were not being thrown at random, or
at least they seemed as if tossed by the same malevolenthand.

As you are all too aware, events surrounding the collapse in

global markets throughout August .... Unfortunately, Long-

gust, and 5z percent for the yea>to-date. Losses of this magni-

light of the historical volatility of the fund)
However, J.M.'s letter was guardedly optimistic about the fund's
future. No doubt this rosy view reflected his honest assessment, but
by now the partners' view of their prospects had seriously diverged
from that of the outside world. Accordingto the letteg the seeds of
Long-Term's disaster had been sown earlier in \177998, when credit
spreads had widened. Long-Term had bet on spreads to narrow
again, but investors had fled from illiquid securities, pushing spreads

wider still. Owing to this \"flight to liquidity,\" as J.M. phrased it,
\"our losses across strategies were correlated after the fact\"--a tor-
tured construction intended to mean that Long-Term had doneevery-
thing it could to avoid such correlations \"before the fact.\"
His analysis was dew\177id of any suggestion that anyone at Long-
Termhadmade a mistake--for instance, by not trimming the balance
sheet at the end of 1997, when opportunities had been so scarce. By
implication, J.M. faulted not his traders but the markets that had
moved against them.
Meriwether assured the investors that \"steps have been taken to
reduce risks now, commensurate with our level of capital.\" But this
was a rather misleading comment, given that Long-Term had done
little in the way of selling and that its leverage had bolted to 55
to \177--a fact that Meriwether omitted.The kindest explanation is that
Meriwether, under the strong influence of Hilibrand and Haghani,
did not consider the core trades to be all that risky. \"We see great op-
portunities m a number of our best strategies,\" he noted. In the
meantime,.J.M.asserted, the fund was \"quite liquid\"--a point that
was true but that failed to address the seriouscash flow problems de-
veloping at LTCM, the partners' management company.
Long-Term faxed the confidential letter on September 2, but one
of the investors leaked it to Bloomberg, the financial news service,
which published it even before the last investor had gotten his copy.
This dollop of unwanted publicity hit the partners like a splashof ice
water. The Wall Street Journal gavetop billing to Long-Term's losses
in a broader story on financial distress,\177' and James Cramer, an on-line
financial columnist, stingingly observed that perhaps the term \"ge-
nius\" should bereserved for Mozart and not for arbitrageurs.'
Though embarrassed by the hooting press, the fund was expecting
a turnaround now that traders were returning from the Hamptons.
August, presumably, had been a quirk. \"People were on vacation,\"
the partners told one another. \"Now it will come back.\" But the day
after Meriwether's letter, Moody's Investors Service downgraded
Brazilian debt. This was a bad sign. The global traders who carried
the germ of financial crisis from country to country were now, as if
by unspoken accord, focusing on Brazil.Currency speculators were
putting the squeeze on S\177oPaulo, which--following the dubious ex-
ampleofMoscow--wa ds enying that it would ever devalue.The last
thing Long-Term wanted was another Russia.

h,cvitably, the banks tightened credit in Brazil. Herb Allison, Mer-
**ll\177spresident, called a meeting for September4, the Friday before
I ab\177r Day, to go over Merrill'srepoexposure is n emerging markets.
Allison, once so supportive of the relationship with Long-Term,
manded to know why Merrill was financing the fund's Brazilian
\177vades, \"What do you mean, Herb?\"one of Allison's underlings re-
t\177;rted, alluding to his boss's former fondness for Long-Term. \"It's
\177ause of you!\" Allison laughed and told his staff not to let it happen
a\177ain,
The banks were agitated not just about hedge funds but about
their own mounting losses, Goldman, Morgan, Salomon Smith Bar-
\177ey, Merrill, and the rest owned huge portfolios of bonds that, in dif-
ferent configurations, were generally similar to L()ng-Term's. The
banks, too, had hedged their portfolios by shorting U.S,Treasurys,
and they were exposed to the same merciless widening of credit
spreads. Moreover, the banks' share prices had tumbled. Goldman,
which had suffered the biggest losses,was especially nervous lest the
bear market ruin its public offering, planned for the following month.
Salomon was nervous, too. Sandy Weill was terrified that the losses
from Arbitrage might jeopardize his pending merger with Citicorp,
also slated for October. Under Weill's steely orders, Salomon contin-
ued to liquidate. The mercurial Haghani had been so upset that he
wanted to buy what remainedofSalomon's portfolio, iust to stop its
selling.His partners thought Haghani was daft--Long-Term wasn't
in a position to buy anything. They all but suspected that the nervy
Haghani was not doing his all to unload assets, almost as though he
secretly enjoyed the thrill of having everything at stake. When in Lon-
don, he continued to pedal to work, as if nothing was wrong.
But the partners noticed an ominous pattern: their trades were
falling more than others'. There was a rally in junk bonds, for in-
stance, but the specific issues that Eong-Term owned stayed de-
pressed, \177Similarly, swap spreads were widening in England much
more than in Germany--the exact opposite of what Long-Term had
bet on--without any apparent economic rationale. In the United
Kingdom, swap spreads soared to 82points, while in Germany they
lingered at 45. \"It didn't make sense,\" a Long-Term trader fumed, If
England was suffering from a flight to quality, it should logically have
struck in Germany, too. But logically orotherwise, Wall Street traders
were running from Long-Term'strades like rats from a sinking ship.

This was no longer purely coincidence. As it scavenged for capital,
Long-Term had been forced to reveal bits and pieces and even the
general outline of its portfolio. Ironically, the secrecy-obsessed hedge
fund had become an open book. Markets, as Vinny Mattone might
say, conspire against the weak. And thanks to Meriwether's letter, all
Wall Street knew about Long-Term'stroubles. Rival firms began to
sell in advance of what they feared would be an avalanche of liqui-
dating by Long-Term. \"As people smelledtrouble, they started get-
ting out,\" Costas Kaplanis, then a trader at Salomon, remarked.
\"Not m attack LTCM--to save themselves.\" As they hammered
away at Long-Term'strades, Leahy felt sick, as though the firm's
competitors were liquidating Long-Term's own positions for it.\17H7ill-
brand had not beenwrong: when you bare your secrets, you're left
naked.
\225
Meriwether may have felt the fund was liquid, but Bear Stearns was
not so sure. Long-Term's assets \"in the box\"--that is, the cash and
securities it kept on call at Bear--were dropping by the day. Bearwas
increasingly uncomfortable about clearing for the fund. Making mat-
ters worse, Robert Shustak, who updated Bear on the fund's results
every afternoon, repeatedly underestimated the fund's losses. This
wasn't intentional on Shustak's part. Long-Term had to estimate the
value of many of its trades, particularly derivatives, \177vhich weren't
publicly quoted, l.ong-Term got its \"'nmrks\"--its prices--from other
traders. And now rival batiks were either playing it safe or exploiting
Long-Term'swoes by marking down its trades, forcing Shustak to go
back to Bear with more accurate numbers.
Mike Alix, Bear's credit managcr, felt it was timeto put Long-Term
on noticc. Alix advised Shustak that if Long-Term's assets in the box
went below $500 million, Bear would stop clearing for the fund. Un-
derlining Bear's state ofagita, Alix ordered Long-Term to find new fi-
nancing for some futures contracts it had financcd with Bear. The
prudent Bear wanted no excess exposure to the hedge fund.
The pressure from Bear put Mike Reisman, l.ong-Term's rcpo
man, in a state of agita aswell.ReismanwasLong-Term' ms oney guy,
the one who found the financing, and usually the best possible fi-
nancing, for its bonds. He was also the closest that l\177ong-Term had
to a genuine character. Only thirty-three, Reisman was a stand-up

,omic who owned a piece of the Gotham Comedy Club in Manhat-
tan. If anyone kept the office light, it was Reisman. But in early Sep-
lcmber, the repo guy was in no mood for comedy. Reisman, who
more than anyone else had his finger on the fund's pulse, told acol-
league that if Long-Term didn't raise new money by the end of the
month, the fund would lose its repo lines, without which it couldn't
survive.
The staff had apersonal reason for feeling anxious. They had their
own capital in the fund, yet they remained in the dark about what the
partners were doing to save it. The employees were quiet heroes,
working long days even as their future became increasingly cloudy.
Naturally, they resented the partners, who worked alongside them
but never shared their secrets. When the bosses shut the door for
meetings, the staffers would wait with clenched teeth. When the part-
hersexited,a staffer would say, \"Hey, guys, what's going on?\" The
typical response: \"We're working on it.\" As a substitute for solid
info, employees mockingly developed a \"necktie index\": the more
partners who wore a tie, the employees kidded, the more big meet-
rags and thus the deeper the firm's trouble!
The partners were, in fact, worried that the employeeswould bolt.
The issue could not be ignored, because I\177TCM, which paid the em-
ployees' salaries,was anything trot liquid. In the first week of Sep-
tember, Fleet Bank called its loans to LTCM. This meant that LTCM
was living on a thread; Fleet could put it into bankruptcy at any time.
Presumably, if that happened, Long-Term's trading counterparties
would then claim a default on their swap agreements and tip the fund
itself into bankruptcy.
Facing their worst crisis yet, the partners moved $38 million out of
the portfolio and into LTCM (which they personally owned) in the
form of a loan. This dubious transaction provided the cash to pay
salaries through the end of \177998, buying LTCM some time with the
employees. The fund's outsidedirectors approved the loan, reasoning
that if LTCM failed, the fund itself could topple. But the loan, even
though contractually permissible,was shot through with conflicts of
interest. The partners were withdrawing--or, technically, borrowing
against--their own investment in the fund without giving the same
opportunity to the outside investors for whom they were trusted fidu-
ciaries. It was a sign of rank desperation.
Even this fancy footwork was not enough. Still facing a threat

from Fleet, LTCM persuaded David Pflug, the Chase Manhattan
banker, to assume Fleet'sloans, which totaled roughly $46 million,
and to agree not to call the $6z million loan already outstanding
from Chase. Rosenfeld was deeply grateful for Chase's \"incredible
move. ''\177But now LTCM was in hock to Chase for $\177o8 million, to
CrSdit Lyonnais for $5o million, to Lloyds for $7 million--and to its
own fund for $38 million.
Seekingcapital yet again, Meriwether called a trio ofMerrill exec-
utives September 6, the Sunday before Labor Day. Duly alarmed,
Merrill's Richard Dunn spent the holiday sifting through the bank's
exposures to Long-Term. Merrill was now worried about more than
its own direct exposure. Dunn was thinking about what would hap-
pen to markets if a collapse by Long-Term sparked a run for the exits:
Could the entire Street fit through the samedoor at once? Merrill was
so concerned that it deputized Dunleavy, the salesman, and Bob
McDonough, the credit manager, to get some facts in Greenwich.
Dunleavy, who was on friendly terms with the partners, asked them
point-blank, \"Are you guys OK?\"The partners, putting their usual
positive spin on matters,said that the firm, despite its problems,was
liquid. Dunleavy later told colleagues that the partners had lied to
him.-
But J.M. and company truly believed that with spreads sowide,a
golden vindication lay around the corner. \"We dreamed of the day
when we'd haveopportunities like this,\" Rosenfeld said. \17W7hat they
lacked was the meanstoexploit them. J.M. was now in Eckstein's po-
sition, facing the prospect of having to let somenewJ.M. make the
killing. Just to beon the safe side, Meriwether told Bill McDonough,
the New York Fedpresident, that Long-Term was having to lookfor
new money..I.M, and other Salomon executiveshad once been criti-
cized for not having advised the Fed of a problemearly enough;J.M.
would not make that mistake again.
\225
Throughout the end of August and into September, the partners'
mood gyrated with their prospects for fresh investment. They side-
stepped the delicate issue of LTCM's cash problems and dwelled on
the supposedly bright prospects for anyone who investednow. Mor-
gan's Mendoza was still promising Szoo million. Hebreezilydropped
the names of blue-chip investors on his list, including Jack Welch, the

chairman of General Electric. However, Mendoza was often dis-
tracted from EFCM by other affairs. He was genuinely fond of the
firm, but the partners were divided on whether Mendoza was their
most effective ally or simply a sympathetic voyeur. In any case, the
partners had plenty of tony names in their own Rolodexes. Myron
Scholes contacted Michael Dell, the personal-computer magnate,
who sent a team to inspect the fund's books. The Basses, the Texasfi-
nanciers, and a host of others followed. Superficially, the blitz resem-
bled Long-Term's first campaign of 1993.
But though they seemed not to realize it, the partners had lost the
aura of invincibility that had opened doors for them before.Theyhad
the flashy r\177sumSs but not the magic--and without it, they were just
another fund. Hoping to land the Ziff 13rothcrs, the pul31ishmg
moguls, Meriwether offered to cut Long Term's uncon3monly high
fee for--and only for--the first three years. Perhaps such a teaser
might have worked once, but now J.M.'s offer of only a temporary
discount struck the Ziffs as arrogant. Such is the ephemeral glitter of
Wall Street: investors will knock down the door of a high-priced
manager and then abandon him when he cuts his rate.
A group of the partners also visited Julian Robertson, the head of
Tiger Management, a big hedge fund operator. Robcrtson, who was
about to disclose a $z billion loss on a misplaced yen bet, may not
have been in a speculating mood. In any case, Robertson, a shrewd
southerner, was not impressed; he saw little to convince him that
l,ong-Term had any superior expertise. Once again, the partners
came up empty. Rarely had such heady credentialsand such a gaudy
list met with such dim results.
Even Long-Term's existing investors were beginning to see the fund
m a harsher light. Marion Pease, the director of finance of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, flew to Greenwich to see Merton and Scholes,
who had virtual hero status in academia. The professors were close-
mouthed about their recent losses but talked up the fund's potential.
Scholes, ever the salesman, expressed confidence that Long-Term
would raise a billion dollars in September and another billion by
year-end. But Pease declined to contribute more2
\"We had been lulled into this dreamlike state,\" said William
Sharpe,aStanford professor who advised one of the fund's investors.
But now Sharpe snapped out of it. When Scholes, his former col-
leagueat Stanford, called to raise more money, Sharpewas wary. t

client, a wealthy Chinese American,wasreadyto invest $3 \260million;
the professor said it was too risky. They agreed that the client would
invest $.o million now and another $,o million if Long-Term could
corral ainajor investor. They were ready to wire the inoney to an es-
crow account, but Scholes delayed the closing. Long-Term knew it
would be pointless to collect money in small amounts.
For the big money, Meriwether continued to angle with Herb Al-
lison at Merrill, Edson Mitchell at Deutsche Bank, Donald Layton, a
vice chairman of Chase, and Gary Brinson, who ran an asset man-
agement unit for UBS. Among them, these Wall Street lions easily had
enough resources. But could the lions beroused from their den? The
partners' glowing forecasts notwithstanding, the bankers had a nose
for trouble. And with Long-Term increasingly desperate, the bankers
could afford to bepatient. Every day that passed, the \"rare opportu-
nity\" merely got cheaper.
Improbableas it seemed, Long-Term's markets kept sinking. Risk-
arb spreads opened to their widest since the ,987 crash. '\177P'ublic
stock offerings ground to a halt, sending a shudder through the
bankers at Goldman Sachs.\" Y\177elds on B-rated bonds climbed to 57 \260
basis points above the yields on blue chips--up from zoo points a
year before. The price of short-term stock market insurance (equity
volatility) doubled. '\177\"It's like a blanket of fear has descended over
the market,\" an options trader told The Wall Street Journal. '\177Over-
seas, prices reflected sheer panic. Interest rates on an index of
emerging-market debt soared to \177,7oo points above U.S. Treasurys--
up from 300 points a year before! '\177Alan Greenspan ominously
warned that the United States could not expectto be an oasis of pros-
perity in such a troubled world2 \17I7t was a bear market in risk no mat-
ter what the asset.
And Long-Term had bet on risk all over the world. In every arbi-
trage, it owned the riskier asset; in every country, the least safe bond.
It had made that one samebet hundreds of times, and now that bet
was losing.
Thursday, September to, was a very bad day. Swap spreads
jumped another 7 points; other spreads widened, too. In a spot of
bad luck--or was it a portent?--a rocket ferrying a dozen Globalstar
satellites fell out of the sky and exploded. Long-Terma,s it happened,
owned Globalstar bonds. The partners almost laughed: even the
heavens were against them. In the risk-management meeting, the
traders went around the table, each reporting his results. When it be-

,ameclear that every trader had lost, Mullins demanded sarcastically,
'\177i(an't we ever make money--just forone day?\" So far in September,
ihcy hadn't, not once. Markets were simply on strike. Everyone was
wiling now--except for Long-Term.
The fund was immobilized by its sheer mass. The smaller fish
around it were liquidating every bond in sight, but Long-Term was
helpless, a bloated whalesurrounded by deadly piranhas. The fright-
lul size of its positions put the partners in a terrible bind. If they sold
even a tiny fraction of a big position--say, ofswaps--it would send
the price plummeting and reduce the value of all the rest. Ever since
his Salomon days, Haghani had pushed his colleagues to double and
evenquadruple their positions. Now he saw that size extracts a price.
By late afternoon on the tenth, the partners knew they had crossed
a debilitating psychological barrier: their capital had fallen below
$z billion. It was late that day when Meriwether got the callhe had
dreaded--from Warren Spector, executive vice president of Bear
Stearns. Long-Term's assets in the box had dipped below $5oo mil-
lion, though they were restored by day's end. Apparently, J.M. ex-
plained, some of Long-Term's trading partners had started to take
their time sending in monies due. Noone wants to pay a prospective
bankrupt. But Spector was past the point of explanations. He curtly
told J.M. that Bear would be sending a team to look at Long-Term's
books on Sunday. Otherwise, it wouldn't clearI.ong-Term'strades on
Monday.
The next day, September ,x, Meriwether called Corzine. The
Goldman chief was en route from Venice, where he had been cele-
brating his wedding anniversary. J.M. had a simplemessage: Long-
Term needed to raise a lot of money in a hurry. One billion dollars
was no longer enough. To have any hope of surviving, the fund
would have to raise at leastSz billion. Then J.M. called McDonough
again, diligently updating the New York l\177'cdchief on Long-Term's ef-
forts to save itself.
When the team from Bear arrived on Sunday, Long-Termwas on
its best behavior. Suddenly a modelclient, it opened its books and set
out aspread of sandwiches. Past the point of raising a fuss, Hilibrand
patiently took the visitors through every trade. Meriwether and
Rosenfeld attended the entire briefing, showing that Long-Term was
taking Bear's threat seriously. Alix was impressed by the performance
but disturbed by the size of Long-Term'strades. The next day, after
Bear's executivecommitteemet, Alix reiterated to Shustak that Boa,

truly regarded the $500 million threshold as inviolate.IfLong-Term
pierced it again, the game would beover.
UBS, Long-Term's biggest investor, was feeling even worse than
Bear. David Solo, a derivatives whiz from the old Swiss Bank,real-
ized-too late--that the newly merged UBS was in for horrendous
losses. AsSoloanalyzed the warrant package, UBS had taken a huge
risk for a potential return of only 8 percent--which now, of course,
it would never realize. \"'All this discussion of option hedging, volatil-
ity and premiums is ridiculous,\" he tapped in an urgent September \1477
e-mail to Marcel Ospel, formerly head of Swiss Bank and now CEO
ofUBS I. n a dig at their mergerpartners,Sol()added conspiratorially,
\"This trade was approved by the UBS group executive board and by
many people sitting around your table.\"
Meanwhile, that Monday, Meriwether, Rosenfeld, and Leahy
called on Lehman Brothers.JeffVanderbeek,who ran the bond side
of Lehman, immediately asked if the rumors he was hearing about
the fund's extreme distresswere true. \"Before we answer, what we'd
like to talk about is the possibility of raising money through your pri-
vate equity group,\" J.M. began, as though nothing were wrong. \"We
gave some money back last year. Now we see the best opportunities
in twenty years.\" His hosts were stunned by Long-Term's nonchalant
pose. Still, the pressure it was under showed. Meriwetherasked
Rosenfeld to explain the portfolio but then curtly interrupted him--
arareshowof impatience toward the trusty partner whom hetreated
like a son. The Lehman crewwas hardly mollified.
\225
Long-Term did have one escapehatch: the rew)lving credit it had ob-
tained in t996 from the bank syndicate led by Chase. The $9oo mil-
lion revolver (raised from $500 million initially) was a standby
facility that l,ong-Term could tap when it wanted. Usually, such facil-
ities terminate automatically if the borrower suffers a sharp deterio-
ration, known as a \"'material adverse change2 \17B7ut in its eagerness to
deal with l,ong-Term, Chase had omitted the material-adverse-change
clause. The revolver was cancelable if, at the end of any accounting
period, Long-Tcrm's equity fell by more than half. And the banks
were squawking that the fund's losses had freed them of their obliga-
tion to fund. But the last \"accounting period\" had ended on July 3 \177--
at which time Long-Term had still had plenty of equity. So technically,

\177hcbanks were on the hook. Thanks to Chase'ssloppy drafting, the
I,auks would have to lend $900 million to an insolvent company.
But the partners were badly split on whether they should borrow.
\\lullins thought they shouldn't. If the fund went down, why take the
banks with them? An additional loan would only complicate matters.
I.M., Hawkins, Modest, and the Nobelists agreed. Hilibrand,
\17la7ghani, Leahy, and Rosenfeld argued strongly for drawing on the
,vvolver.How else, they asked, could they hope to replenish their
,apital at Bear? Krasker, McEntee, and Shustak were for funding,
\177o. Rickards, the lawyer, pointed out that Long-Term might be
Imble to its own investors if it didn't pnrsue every option. \"We don't
have to decide at this juncture,\" .I.M. finally said, cutting off the de-
bate. They didn't need the money quite yet.
The partners still had Goldman Sachs and Corzinc, \177vho now, ili
mid-September, emerged as Long-Term's one best hope. Tall and
I,carded,Corzine had always seemed an unlikely financier. Born in a
la:mhouse in southern Illinois, he had played basketball in college
.u\177dmarried a girl from his kindergarten class. \177In \177975, a year after
\\lcriwcther had been hired by Salomon, Corzinehadjoined the bond
&:partment at Goldman. He had developed into a talented trader,
\177hough less celebrated than Meriwether, whom he frankly admired
.rod whose arbitrage nnit hc viewed as a model for his own firm. As
( orzineclimbed the ranks at Goldman, he remained unaffected and
vasygoing, known for fuzzy patched sweaters in a world of three-
piecesuits.
Goldman, Wall Street's last private full-service investment bank,
dinted certain traits with kong-Term. Its partners were secretive and,
tot many decades, had been unusually close. The Goldman culture
was exceptionallydiscreet (there is no indication of (;oldman's pres-
,\177ce in the lobby of its headquarters at 8s Broad Strcct). Until recent
Im\177es, Goldman had been known for the care that it lavished on blue-
,hip corporate clients. An apostle of relationship banking, Goldman
had disdained hostile takcovcrsandeveneschewed trading for its own
account, on the noble premise that trading could put the bank into
conflict with its customers. \177B-ut in the I98OSand early '9os, such
drawing room niceties were cast aside.The leadership duo of Stephen
t\177riedman and Robert Rubiu, later of Treasury fame, confidently ex-
panded into trading, and as Goldman's bankers removed their white
vloves, conflicts with customers became common. When the b\177md

market cracked in 1994, Goldman--which, like Long-Term, had set
risk limits according to statistical models ofvolatility--suffered enor-
mous and destabilizing losses. Goldman discovered that its leveraged
positions were well known to other traders, and it could not get out
of them without suffering heavy losses. Is Partners defected en masse,
saddling the unpretentious Corzine, who tookover in the fall of t994,
with the job of rebuilding the partnership as well as the business. The
firm bounced back, but (;oldman's partners--again like I.ong-
Term's--realized that they needed more capital, which was the reason
for their planned stock offering. Meanwhile, Corzine further empha-
sized the lucrative business of trading for the bank's account.
Corzine had been intrigued with the ideaof joining forces with Meri-
wether before,and now he could deal with his rival from a position of
strength. He agreed to provide investment capital, but at a price: hede-
manded half of the partners' management company, full access to Long-
Term'sstrategies, and the right to set a limit on the fund's exposures.
The congenial financier was proposing nothing short of a takeover.
However, Corzine was offering $ \177billion of Goldman's and its clients'
money, as well as a promiseto helpLong-Termraisea second billion.
And merely informing the world that Goldman was in Long-Term's
corner might stop the bleeding. Meriwether couldnot sayno.
The two firms quickly struck a tentative deal, conditional on Gold-
man's raising the money and on Long-Term'spassing an inspection,
a customary process. Goldman had to move fast, before any more of
Long-Term's capital was lost. The week of September'4, the fund
handed over mountains of filesand dispatched Rosenfeld, Merton,
and four of the staff to Broad Street. Merton waxed poetic about the
supposed strategic value of the two firms' joining. A Goldman team
peppered the arbitrageurs with questions. Then a half-dozen lawyers
from Sullivan & Cromwell, Goldman's outside law firm, marched in
and subjected the emissaries from Long-Term to a torturous grilling.
In Greenwich, Goldman's sleuths, who had the run of the office, left
no stone unturned. Long-Term's staff couldn't keep track of who the
Goldman people were, so many were rummaging through the hedge
fund's files. A key member of the Goldman team was Jacob Goldfield,
a lanky and brilliant but abrasive trader. Witnessesclaimed that the
headstrong Goldfield appeared to be downloading Long-Term's posi-
tions, which the fund had so zealously guarded, from Long-Term's own
compnters directly into an oversizedlaptop (a detail that Goldman
law, &-nit-d). Meanwhile, Goldman'straders in New York were selling

someof the very same positions. At the end of one day, when the fund's
positions were worth a good deal less,some Goldman traders in Long-
Term's officessauntered up to the trading desk and offered to buy
them. ''\17B7razenly playing both sides of the street, Goldman represented
investment banking at its mercenary ugliest. To.I.M. and his partners,
Goldman was raping Long-Term in front of their very eyes.
On Monday, the day the Goldman invasion was launched, equity
volatility climbed to an astonishing 3z percent! On Tuesday it hit 33
percent--each point cost the fund $4o million. Throughout the
fund's portfolio it was a similarstory.Long-Term'tsrades--its trades
in particular--were mercilessly battered, from Danish mortgages to
Volkswagen shares to jmik bonds \177fStation Casinos and Starwood.
ShellTransport, which I,ong-Tern\177 had purchased \177t\177m8 percent dis-
count to Royal Dutch, dis\177strously widc\177cd to a spread of \1774per-
cent. Even the reliabletrade in Italian bonds, which had made money
during most of \177998, now fell back, too.
In every class of asset and all over the world, the market moved
\177lgainst the hedge fund in Greenwich. Rickards, the house attorney,
described it to colleagues as the \"LTCM death trade.\" The correla-
tions had gone to one; every roll was turning up snake eyes. The
mathematicians had not foreseen this. Random markets, they had
thought, would lead to standard distributions--to a normal pattern
of black sheep and white sheep, heads and tails, and jacks and
deuces, not to staggering losses in every trade, day after day after day.
The professors had ignored the truism--of which they were well
aware--that in markets, the tails are always fat. Stuck in their glass-
walled palace far from New York's teeming trading floors, they had
forgotten that traders are not random molecules,or even mechanical
logicians such as Hilibrand, but people moved by greed and fear, ca-
pable of the extreme behavior and swings of mood so often observed
in crowds. And in the late summer 0f \179798, the bond-trading crowd
\177vas extremely fearful, especially of risky credits. The professors
hadn't modeled this. They had programmed the market for a cold
predictability that it had never had; they had forgotten the predatory,
\177lcquisitive, and overwhelmingly protective instincts that govern real-
life traders. Theyhad forgotten the human factor.

on the basisof inside knowledge. Goldman, indeed, was an extremely
activetrader m mid-September, and rumors that Goldman was sell-
ing Long-Term's positions in swaps and junk bonds were all over
Wall Street. 111 fact, its high-yield traders were said to be bragging
about it.
Goldman officials denied such charges: in any case accusations
were hardly limited to it. Knowledgeof l.ong-Term's portfolio was,
by now, colnmonplacc. Salomon was, and had been, pounding the
fund's positions for months. Deutsche Bank was bailing out of swap
trades, and American International Group, which hadn't shown any
interest in equity volatility before, was suddenly bidding for it. Why
this sudden interest, if not to exploit l.ong-Term's distress?Morgan
and UBSwere buying volatility, too. Some of this activity was clearly
predatory. Thegame,asoldas Wall Street itself, was simple: if l.ong-
Term could be madeto feelenough pain--couldbe\"squeezed\"--the
fund would cry uncle and buy back its shorts. Then, anyone who
owned those positions would make a bundle.
Yet the extent of predatory trading was less than one might sup-
pose, and certainly less than was later asserted in certain paranoid
theories in Greenwich. The partners' bunkered view of the world
made them highly susceptible to conspiracy theories, particularly
since such explanations shifted the blame for their losses to others.
Being so self-absorbed, the arbitrageurs naturally assumed that the
banks wereobsessed with Greenwich, too.
But the simplefactis that by mid-September, the Wall Street banks
were not principally worried about Long-Term Capital--they were
worried about themselves. Given that every bank had many of the
same trades asLong-Term e, xiting from their positions was a matter
of self-preservation G. oldman in particular was steeped in losing
trades and, with its stock offering just weeks away, was desperate to
cut its losses. But it bears repeating that by mid-September, the out-
lines of Long-Term's portfolio were well known on Wall Street, not
just by firms such as Goldman that had seen kong-Terln'S books, and
the selling by banks was similarly widcsprcad.
It made no difference whether the banks were consciously trying
to profit at Long-Term's expense or merely protecting themselves
from the tidal wave of selling that they anticipated from Greenwich.
Either motivation would have produced the same behavior--a
wholesale flight from Long-Term's trades. One Long-Termtrader saw
his best friend, a fellow former academic now at Deutsche Bank,



==================================================
                     PAGE 184                     
==================================================

dumping Long-Term'spositions. The other traders knew that if Long-
Term collapsed, the ground would tremble. \"If you think a gorilla has
to sell, then you sure want to sell first,\" noted a Goldman trader in
London. \"We are very clear on where the line is; that's not illegal.\"
With the exception of stocks in America, which are specifically
subject to insider trading laws that arc enforced as nowhereelse,
trading on private information goes on all the time. Investment banks
that also operate proprietary bond-trading desks, such as Salomon
and Goldman, publicly boasted ofexploiting their knowledge of the
\"customer flow.\" Translated, this meant that when a Salomon or a
Goldman got wind of which way its customerswere running, it often
ran there too--and fast. This was why (;oldman's previous stewards
had refused to get inw)lvcd in proprietary trading; the possibility of
conflicts of interest was just too great. But by 1998 , Goldman was
known as an aggressive, bare-knuckled trader that had long since
abandoned any pretense of being a gentleman banker.
Ofcourse, if Goldman or anyone else took advantage of informa-
tion it obtained privately from Long-Term it could, theoretically, be
liable under fraud statutes. Corzine, for his part, did not deny that
Goldman traders \"did things in markets that might have ended up
hurting LTCM. We had to protect our own positions. That part I'm
not apologetic for.\"
Corzine did deny that Goldmau traded any differently as a result
of its access to Long-Term than it otherwise would have. Given the
kind of quarter it was having, he added wryly, it was strange to hear
that Goldman was accused of making untoward profits. >
\225
Long-Term was completely at such rivals' tender mercy because its
trades were soarcane and specialized. For instance, only a handful of
dealers--Morgan, Salomon, UBS, Soci\177t\177 G\177n\177rale, Bankers Trust,
and Morgan Stanley--traded equity w)latility. They knew that Long-
Term was massively short, and they knew that sooner or later the
fund would have to buy its way out of the trade. So, the dealers re-
fused to sell. In desperation, Long-Term called Soci\177t\177G\177n\177rale, seek-
ing a bid for its position, but the French bank quoted a ridiculously
lofty price: \177opercentage points above the market! Absurd as it was,
there were no other potential buyers of equity volatility. Inevitably,
the price ballooned.
Normally, a free market cures such bubbles on its own. lu \177,\177s,,.

for instance, the Hunt brothers had tried to cornerthe silver market,
briefly taking the price to $50anounce. But then people began to sift
through attics for stowed-away silver, and scrap dealers all over the
world started melting it down. When all that metalreached the mar-
ket, the price went back to $5 an ounce,and the Hunts filed for bank-
ruptcy. But equity volatility was a rare bird. No one had stored
volatility in his attic, there was no surplus source of supply. \"Equity
volatility was the ultimate short squeeze,\"said a knowledgeable
Long-Term employee. \"There were only four or five dealers. And
they refused to sell.\"
As the firm's losses mounted, the latent divide between the inner
group of partners and the others fermented into sour wine. Inevitably,
the lesser partners blamed Hilibrand and Haghani for blowing so
much wealth. Hawkins and Hilibrand, never the bestof friends, be-
came bitter toward each other, and Scholes and Hilibrand were
barely speaking. The unhappy partners resented not just Hilibrand's
and Haghani's investment calls but their domineering, insensitive
style. Scholes felt that the secretive Hilibrand hadn't really been a
partner; Larry hadn't trusted the others. Ironically, it was the same
complaint that the banks had been making allalong.McEntee, mean-
while, was increasingly absent from the firm. He was immobilized by
an aching back, a symbolic expression of the partners' despair, and
increasingly bitter that Meriwether hadn't heeded his warnings.
Given their frayed nervesand their enormous losses, it was only
human for the partners to show sometension. They were losing not
only their fortunes but also their reputations. Meriwether was facing
the unbearable indignity of aseconddisaster in a once shining career.
And his traders, no matter what they might accomplish later, would
always be known for their role in Long-Term's stupendous riseand
fall. Rosenfeld, the most emotional of the group and the most de-
voted to the firm, was touchingly affected. At least he wasnot afraid
to scream when the anguish overcame him.
Merton, his teacher, was upset, too; he was distraught and not
himself. Worrying that Long-Term's collapse would undermine the
standing of modern finance--all he had really worked for--Merton
repeatedly broke into tears. The professor was wonderfully human,
after all. Scholes, too, knew that if the firm failed, many would

consider their Nobel Prizes tarnished. Coincidentally, as the fund
plummeted, Scholesmadea long-scheduled visit to his hometown,
Hamilton, Ontario, where he was honored as a local boy turned
Nobel laureate. His audience had no idea of the trouble at Long-
Term, and the tension on the guest of honor must have beenunbear-
able. After fondly recalling his youth there, Scholes nearly broke
down.-\"
Mullins's prospects had darkened, aswell. The natty banker had
once imagined that he might be a successor to Alan Greenspan. Now
that would neverhappen.
Yet amid this unceasing agony, the partners mostly kept their feel-
ings in check. Their simmering rcscntmcnts never, or very rarely, bub-
bled into the open. Thcy c(mtmucd w()rkiug together aud refrained
from shouting or openly pointing fingers. Indeed, given the circum-
stances, they functioned remarkablywell. It said something about the
bonds between them, particularly within the inner circle.They mut-
tered under their breath but didn't shirk their jobs. If any one person
was to blame, at least in the eyes of the lesserpartners, it was Meri-
wether--for not having run the firm with a stronger hand. And no
one wanted to blameJ.M.
Meriwether, typically, kept his emotions under wraps. Although
deeply distressed about the losses, he stayed cool--indeed, Rosenfeld
had barely seen him angry in fifteen years. Meriwether seemed to un-
burden himself only in moments of levity, when the tension of work-
mg fifteen-hour days, seven days a week, gave way to a sense of the
absurd. One night, around z .\177.M., J.M. was sitting with l\177eahy,
Rosenfeld, and Rickards. Exhaustion had made them giddy, and the
group started to talk about renaming the company if it managed to
survive. J.M. said wryly, \"I guess we could call ourselves'No-
Haircut Capital Management.'\" That broke up the group; J.M.'s
humor always cheered them. Then, as if to make light of their brutal
handiwork, Meriwether whistled and added, \"Oh, we took the Swiss
down big.\" He meant UBS, the big Swiss investor. J.M. joked, \"We'll
never be able to set foot in Switzerland again--they'll arrest us the
moment we get off the plane!\"
\225
As Goldman's bankers looked for money, they discovered a fact th:,l
Meriwether hadn't disclosed: the best prospects on Goldmau's lisl,

such as Buffett, Soros, Michael Dell, and Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin
Talal bin Abdulaziz al-Saud,hadalready been called by Long-Term--
and had already rejected the fund. Corzine was more than a little
piqued; with the situation so desperate, it was no timeforLong-Term
to be playing coy.
Long-Term was still losing scores of millions ofdollars each day. It
was desperately trying to pair its trades, but its progress was slow. It
was juggling positions to stay above its minimum at Bear, but its
mounting losses, compounded by unfavorable marks (prices), moved
it ever closer to the edge.The firm tried to dump positions on its
banks, but the Merrills and the Goldmans had no interest: they were
overinvested in the sametrades.
\225
By mid-September, the partners were praying for three strokes of luck
to turn markets: for Congressto approve more aid to the IMF, for the
IMF to approve a bailout of Brazil,and for Greenspan to lower in-
terest rates. Of the three, Greenspan was the most crucial and the
least predictable.
The Fed was deeply concerned about the widening of credit
spreads, and the New York branch had repeatedly been advised of
Long-Term's plight. Also, on September t i, Representative Richard
Baker, a Louisiana Republican, alerted Greenspan to the fact that
hedge funds were aggravating the condition of publicly traded banks.
In a perceptive letter, Representative Baker,who was getting inside
dope from a Morgan graduate on his staff, warned, \"It has cometo
my attention that unregulated hedge funds which are often highly
leveraged may be contributing to very substantial declines in the
market value of regulated fina\1773cial institutions.\" The crisis was now
public. On September \1775,George Soros warned the House Banking
Committee that Russia's implosion had ledto aglobal credit crunch.
He blamed banks for fostering a \"daisy chain of derivativestransac-
tions\"--language that seemed informed by his secret dealings with
l.ong-Term.
The following day, September i6, Greenspan went before the same
panel. He dashed the market's hopes, telling Congress that a rate cut
was out of the question. Incredibly,, he again downplayed the risks
posed by rogue investors such as hedge funds. The chairman's
credulity seemed to know no bounds: \"Hedge funds are strongly reg-

THE HUMAN FACTOR \225179
ulated by those who lend the money,\" Greenspan asserted. Given that
Long-Term's lenders had bankrolled the runaway hedge fund, it is
hard not to conclude that Greenspanwas either woefully out of touch
or willfully deaf to what he had heard. Secretary Rubin, at least, ac-
knowledged that the bull market had inevitably dulled many bankers'
sense of prudence. \"Where you've had five, six, sevenyears of good
results,\" he told the panel, \"people who extend credit tend to get a
little less careful.\"-'-'
\225
Finance is often poetically just; it punishes the reckless with special
fervor. Long-Term's creditors were discovering that their past le-
niency had made the current crisis worse. Whereas when a typical
client defaulted, a reserve would exist in the form of margin money
held by lenders, Long-Term could theoretically drop all the way to
zero.Thebanks' willingness to finance Long-Term without any hair-
cuts had enabled the fund to operate right up to the edge. Now, if it
defaulted, nothing would beleft.
Not surprisingly, the lenders were horrified by what they had
wrought. \"We had no idea they would have trouble--these people
were known for risk management. They had taught it; they designed
it,\" reflected Dan Napoli, the Merrill risk manager who had so en-
joyed golfing with the partners in Ireland. \"God knows, we were
dealing with Nobel Prize winners!\" Ironically, only a very intelligent
gang could have put Wall Street in such peril. Lesser men wouldn't
have gotten the financing or attracted the following that resulted in
such a bubble.
In a sure sign that the credit net around the fund was tightening,
General Re, an insurance company that was in the process of merg-
ing with Berkshire Hathaway, was contesting Long-Term's
\"marks\"--that is, arguing about where to price its trades--virtually
every day. Tony Iliya, the London-based head of General Re's deriv-
atives subsidiary, which had financed yen swaps with Long-Term,
was waking people in Tokyo in the middle of the night to press claims
against the fund.
Even J. P. Morgan, which was offering capital to Greenwich
with one hand, was sifting through its exposure to Long-Term to pre
parefora possible default with the other. \"It was going to hc
ugly,\" a Morgan executive confided. Bankruptcy does no\177

180 \225WHEN GENIUS FAILED
derivative parties from seizing collateral. If Long-Term filed, it could
expectto find its fax machine humming with claims from each of its
fifty or so counterparties. In fact, if Long-Term defaulted on an 3, of
its seven thousand derivative contracts, it would automatically trig-
ger a default in every one of the others, which covered some $\177-4 tril-
lion in notional value. In a bizarre touch, even a cot\242templatio\177\242 of
bankruptcy was considered an act of default. Long-Term's lawyers
wouldn't even mention the B word. They cloaked their deliberations
in a childlike game. One lawyer would ask another, \"What if there
was a fund that lost a lot of money; do you think it would file?\"
Notwithstanding this playacting, Meriwether knew he had less than
a week to save his firm.
\225
Salomon Smith Barney--Long-Term's progenitor--had stayed aloof
from the rescue efforts. But on Wednesday,September \1767, Salomon
jumped into the action. The bank sent Rob Adrian, Salomon's head
of risk management for equities, Andy Constan, who ran derivatives
trading for the firm, and Marc Wcill--Sandy'sson--to Greenwich.
They expected to join Goldman and others of the banks in a wide-
ranging meeting.However, by the time the Salomon group arrived,
just after 4 P.M., the meeting was over. Adrian noticed an eerie quiet;
doorswereclosed a, nd the trading floor was deserted. Haghani took
them to an office and bluntly announced that only one topic re-
mained on the agenda. \"We need money,\" he noted.:'
Haghani offered to show them the books, which were now an
open secret, but Weill, knowing of his dad's antipathy to arbitrage,
didn't want to compromise Salomon by seeing too much. So the
group drove home.
The next day, Salomon sent a more senior team: Steve Black,
Thomas Maheras, and Peter Hirsch. By now Haghani seemed to be
in shock. Over the last five trading days, Long-Term had lost $53o
million. The losses seemed even worse for having been so relentless.
On Thursday, September IO, the firm had lost $I45 million; on Fri-
day, $1zo million. The next week it hadn't stopped: on Monday,
Long-Termdropped $55 million; on Tuesday, $87 million. Wednes-
day, September \1776,was especially bad: $\177zz million. Like a biblical
plague, the losses gave no respite. Haghani went over the losses with
a clinical air, as if they had happened to someone else.He couldn't

THE HUMAN FACTOR \225181
get over the fact that Long-Term's diversification hadn't worked. The
August losses he understood, but September's--when the markets
should have recovered--baffled him. U.S. swap spreads had climbed
to an astonishing 83 points; U.K. swaps, incredibly, were at 88!
Long-Term's massivepositions in these two trades alone could bank-
rupt it. Haghani bitterly blamed Wall Street,especially Goldman, for
ganging up on the friendless fund. \177'\177
Though furious at Goldman, the partners were, quixotically,
counting on the bank as a savior. Rosenfeld and others were calling
Goldman throughout the week, with growing desperation. Despite
Goldman's initial optimism, it hadn't yet raised the money, and Long-
Term now figured that it needed uot two but four billion dollars--
quite a sum. Meriwether, Hilibrand, Roscutcld, \177(1 Morton went to
press their case with Goldman on Thursday moruiug, Scptc\177d\177cr \1777.
Corzine and John Thain, the narrow-set, angular chief financial offi-
cer,ushered
them in.
Rosenfeld said, in so many words, \"You're our last chance.\"
l,ater that Thursday, Meriwether advised Bill McDonough of
Long-Term's plight. Ironically, the fund made money that day, its first
profit all month. But the profit was a pittance, $6million--fartoo lit-
tle and too late. Long-Term's equity was down to $1..5billion. It was
astonishing to think that only a month had passedsinceRussia'sde-
fault. In that one month, Long-Termhad lostsix tenths of its capital,
one of Wall Street's epic collapses.
On Friday, Long-Term heard from Goldman. Thain noted that
very few people could invest in the amounts that Long-Termneeded.
Buffett might be good for a chunk, and Soros might, but Long-Term
had already called them, as well as virtually everyone else on Gold-
man'slist.Peter Kraus, a Goldman investment banker, had talked to
Buffett that very morning. Buffett had reiterated that, as he had told
Hilibrand, he wasn't interested. The others had refused,too. There-
fore, Thain didn't think it was possible. Thain didn't bother to say
what he was thinking privately: to all appearances, Long-Term was
going under.
\225
But Goldman didn't stop trying. Kraus and Buffett spoke several
more times that day. The biggest stumbling block for Buffett was th\177
he didn't like Long-Term's complicated partnership structure. IIt\"h:\177d

no interest in its various feeder funds and certainly none in the tan-
gled detailsofLTCM. Buffett had folded his own partnership decades
ago, partly for such reasons; he had no useforsomebodyelse's. But
if it was just a matter of buying Long-Term's portfolio--which now
was pretty beaten down--without keeping Meriwether, his staff, or
his company, that might work, Buffett told Kraus. Refining this
thought, the two began to talk about Berkshire and Goldman jointly
bidding for Long-Term's assets, perhaps along with AIG, the insurer.
Meanwhile, Kraus reported this slight progress to Corzine. Through-
out the day, Goldman kicked around the notion of a Berkshire-
Goldman bid aswellas other ways of saving the fund.
At Long-Term, the situation was becomingdire. The firm got a let-
ter from Bear flatly stating its intention to stop clearing below $5oo
million--clearly the final step before cutting it off. Now it was time
to talk to Chase. Though Long-Term felt that legally it could draw on
its loan facility anytime, the partners wanted to hear Chase say so,
too. Mullins, the house banker, called David Pflug. Pflug had already
stuck his neck out for Long-Term by assuming Fleet's loan. Would he
do
it again?
Pflug, a banker's banker, knew that if Chase and the other syndi-
cate members did fund, they might not get the money back. But if
Chase didn't fund, it could be liable. Moreover, Pflug was afraid that
if Long-Term collapsed, it might reverberateallover Wall Street. And
Wall Street wasa majorclient. Calling Walter Shipley, Chase's chair-
man, Pflug said\177 \"I don't think we have any choice.\"
Meanwhile, Long-Term\177s markets were tumbling again. Incredibly,
equity volatility jumped to 35 percent.U.S. swaps widened to 841/\177,.
And on it went. Mortgage spreads widened by 7 points, junk bonds
by 5. The Dow fell zi8 points; Japanese stocks fell to levels not seen
since19
86.
Friday evening, Rosenfeld called Morgan's Peter Hancock, who
lived in Mamaroneck, the same town as Rosenfeld, and whose chil-
dren attended the same school as Rosenfeld's. The usually collected
arbitrageur was highly agitated; he was petrified that Bear would pull
the plug and confided that I,ong-Term might not survive the follow-
ing week. Long-Term was losing its credit lines, and its woes were
being exacerbated by rumors (many of them false or wildly exagger-
ated)about
its positions.
On a whim, Rosenfeld suggested that the Morgan banker call

Thain at Goldman. As far as is known, that was the first time anyone
had asked the banks to coordinate their efforts.Hancock and Thain
spoke that night.
Kraus, the banker spearheading the Goldman effort, had taken his
wife and a client to a Beethovenconcert in Newark on Friday. At in-
termission,Kraus ducked out to a pay phone and dialed Omaha.He
and Buffett penciled out some numbers foradeal. Buffett said some-
thing about going on a trip, and Kraus went back to Beethoven,say-
ing nothing to his wife or the client. Then Buffett called Joseph
Brandon of General Re, Berkshire's soon-to-beinsuranceacquisition.
\"There are folks that are in meltdown. They may not make it,\" the
billionaire warned. \"Accept no excuses for anyonc who doesn't
post collateral or make a margin call. Accept \177 exc;tses.\" Then he
hopped a plane for Seattle to mect a Bill (;atcs-lcd group that was
planning a two-week holiday in Alaska and some of the western na-
tional parks. \177s
Now the dream was alive that Buffett would rescue Long-Term--
as he had, coincidentally, Salomon seven years earlier. Nonetheless,
Corzine thought the Fed should be brought into the loop. He called
McDonough, who also spoke with the headsof other big banks. To
a man, the bankers said that I.ong-Term's troubles were depressing
markets. Moreover, they were worried that if l\177ong-Term failed it
could have a seriously destabilizing effect.
With such fears in mind, Corzine offered to have Goldman brief
the Fed on Long-Term's portfolio. Meriwether agreed that the Fed
should be briefed but naturally preferred to have Long-Termdo it di-
rectly. Thus, on Saturday, Mullins, a former central banker, called
McDonough and invited the Fed to Greenwich.
McDonough, of course, had been thinking about Long-Termfora
while.He had known that eventually he might have to step in; he also
knew that doing so would exposethe Fedto criticism. A regulator is
part protector, part godfather. He dislikes a public spectacle; he is
most effective when he can wield his power discreetly, by merely
threatening to act or by cajoling others to do his bidding. Most ideal,
in McDonough's mind, would be for some private Wall Street leader
to orchestrate a solution.He and John Whitehead, the chairman of
the New York Fed, talked about who coulddoit.Once, Walter Wris-
ton of Citibank or Gus Levy of Goldman could have rallied Wall
Street. A century ago, ofcourse,J. P. Morgan, St., had played the

to perfection. But who could play the part today? McDonough and
Whitehead agreed on the answer: no one. Wall Street had many
bankers but no J. P. Morgan. \177'(T'herefore, although the Fed was
agreeing only to be briefed, not to play an active role, McDonough
was ready to take the first step.
The meeting was scheduledfor Sunday. But McDonough was plan-
ning to fly to I,ondon the night before. He decided not to cancel--
it would upset markets--and to send Peter Fisher, his deputy, to
Long-Term instead. Before McDonough left, he briefed both
Greenspan and Rubin and told them that I,ong-Term's attempt to
raise capital had failed.-'-
But Goldman was still on the case. By chance, David Sol(), the
Swiss-based derivatives maven at UBS,was in New York for the wed-
ding of a friend. Corzine tracked him down and asked if UBS would
want to join a fund-raising effort for Long-Term.Solosaid, \"Fine,
but do you realize we're their biggest equity investor? I don't think
our interests are exactly aligned.\" Corzine, who hadn't known, rang
off, obviously irritated. He was getting tired of trying to rescuea firm
about which, apparently, he was still in the dark.
Corzine also talked to Buffett on Saturday, though only when Buf-
fett could get a connection via cell phone from the depths of an
Alaskan fjord. \"He was doing this float-around,\" Corzine recalled,
hisexasperation showing. \"You'd lose contact and couldn't speak for
two or three hours.\"\177'\177 According to Buffett, who had neverhad much
use for nature and had been arm wrestled into the trip by Bill Gates,
\"The guy in the boat wanted to go over and look at the moose, and
I wanted to get in line with the satellite connection. It was just a hor-
rible connection.''
\177''
But he got his point across all the same. Buffett was willing to let
Goldmanhandle the details, but under no circumstancesdid he want
his investment to be managed by LTCM or to have anything tn do
with John Meriwether.Then the connection blacked out.

country's economic cycles, nor was there much it could do to ease the
periodic crises that afflicted Wall Street. Too often, the government
had had ti) go hat in hand to a private banker for help. By the Pro-

peoplewanted a bank that xvould represent the public interest. Ever
since, the Fed has beena public servant but one that works in close
proximity to private banks and to Wall Street. It is a delicate role,for
the Fed is supposed to regulate banking but not to shelter bankers. It
must protect the functioning ofmarkets without appearing to be too
close--too protective--of the banks it watches over.
The side of the Fed most often seen in public is its governing
board, in Washington, which has the high-profile job of adjusting

bly the most respected of all those who have held the job, thanks to
the economy's stellar performance during his tenure. If Greenspan
has perfected a convoluted, often impenetrable style of public utter-
ances, this has only heightened his image as the nation's economicor-
acle.
More than is commonly realized, Greenspan relieson theFed's in-
dividual branches, particularly on the New York Fed, which, among
its other roles, functions as Washington's periscope into markets.
William McDonough, the beefy presidentof the New York Fed, kept
in close touch with private bankers andreportedon what he heard to
Greenspan. His associatewas Peter Fisher, in \179798 a forty-two-year-
old bureaucrat who had joined the Fed straight out of Harvard Law
School F. isher ran the Fed's trading deskand oversaw a $45 o billion
portfolio of government securities. When Greenspan wanted to
tighten or loosen monetary conditions, Fisher and his staff actually
carried out the directive by either buying more securities or selling
so me. \177
Fisher, who is six feet,threeinches tall with graying curly hair, had
been paying attention to hedge funds well before the Long-Term cri-
sis. In his view, hedge funds were merely onemore sign of the econ-
omy's increasing tendency to parcel out to specialists the iobs (such
as lending and investing) that had previously been handled by com-
mercial banks. For instance, in the 198os, when Latin Americangov-
ernments couldn't pay their loans, the damage had been borne
entirely by a few big banks. But in the \17799os, when Mexico de-
faulted, the pain was felt by dozens ofhedge funds and mutual funds,
and by their investors--who had assumed the banks' traditional role
of providing capital to emerging markets. Fisher's overall view of
hedge funds was not dissimilar to Merton's notion that Long-Term
was essentially a bank.
However,Long-Termwas not a bank, and the Feddoes not have
authority over hedge funds. Had Fisher demanded to seeLong-Term's
books--or any hedge fund's--it could in theory have refused. But in
practice, Fisher routinely talked to traders at hedge funds, some of
whom freely shared their opinions on the market and all of whom
tacitly recognized the Fed's authority. And for Sunday, Fisher had an
invitation.
Canceling plans to watch his eight-year-oldson and six-year-old
daughter play soccer, Fisher, who lived in Maplewood, New Jersey,a

middle-class suburb light-years from Greenwich,hitched a ride with
Dino Kos, one of his assistants, in Kos's Jeep. At Long-Term's offices,
they rendezvoused with Gary Gensler, an assistant secretary of the
Treasury and former partner of Rubin's at Goldman Sachs, and with
another official from the Fed.
Long-Term's offices were quiet. The Sun workstations were mostly
unattended. Mullins ushered the visitors into the conference room
with the other partners,passing by a room where, Fisher noticed,
Jacob Goldfield and his Goldman team were poring over Long-
Term's files.
After some brief cordialities, Hilibrand showed the bureaucrats a
document so secret that even most of l\177ong-'lbrm's employees had
never seen it. The document was known as the \"'risk aggrcgator.\"
Long-Term was hard for outsidersto understand because many of its
positions consisted of multiple trades. What's more, its derivatives
book was a monstrosity of contracts each of which was offset by
other contracts. The risk aggregator simplified the portfolio by sum-
marizing i,ong-Term's exposure to each individual market.
Fisher studied the report likea pathologist scanning an X ray. As
he listened to the presentation, herealized that the patient was in crit-
ical condition. Each exposure in the risk aggregator was listed in a
separate row, and the rows were grouped into separate boxes by cat-
egory. For instance, the first box was Account \"LToo3,\" which dealt
with \"USD (H/US),\" or U.S. dollar fixed income. The first entry in
the first box said:
USDY-shift...
2s-\177os @ 45 \22-5- -2.80... 5 y-sh... \1774.oo
This line gave Long-Term's exposure to a flattening of the yield
curve between two--year and ten-year Treasury bonds, for which the
spread was then 45 basispoints. For each movement of five basis
points, Long-Term could make (orlose)$2.8 million. The expected
volatility of the trade over one year was five such jumps, meaning
that, according to its models, Long-Term's yearly exposure was no
more than $/4 million.
The next entry, \"USD_Z+D-shift,\" showed Long-Term's exposure
to achange in short-term interest rates. It wasn't until the fifth line that
Fisher saw a truly alarming number. Under \"USD_Swap Spread,\"
Long-Term showed an exposure of $240 million--but that was as-
suming that swap spreads stuck to their historic volatility of only \17s7

points a year. And given that swaps had already moved in a 4o-point
range in i998 , that assumption had becomelaughable. There were
twenty-five entries in all--on just the first page. And the risk aggrega-
tor went to fifteen pages. The sheer mass of it was numbing.
Turning to the international trades, Hilibrand showed Fisher rows
ofentries for bonds and swaps in Great Britain, mortgages in Den-
mark, swap spreads in New Zealand, bonds in Hong Kong, and var-
ious exposures in Sweden and Switzerland as well as in Germany,
Frauce, and Belgium. Fisher saw bonds in Italy, Spain, and the
Netherlands, too.
And then Fisher saw more entries,now pertaining to the fund's po-
sitions in stocks. He was shocked by the massive entries for stock
market volatility. Then came Long-Term's exposures in emerging
markets: Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Venezuela, Korea, Poland,
China, Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines. There were
three entries for Russia, including \"Russia Hard Currency Direc-
tion'-meaning that the fund had gone directional, or speculated
outright.
At first it seemed astonishing that so many trades should have col-
lapsed simultaneously. But gazing over the portfolio, Fisher had an
epiphany: Long-Term's tradeswere linked--they had been correlated
before the fact. \"They had the same spread trade everywhere in the
world,\" Fisher thought. Gensler had a related thought: During a cri-
sis, the correlations always go to one. When aquake hits, all markets
tremble. Why was Long-Termso surprised by that?
When the partners fiuished with the risk aggregator, they went
through auother document, breaking down Long-Term'sexposure
according to counterparty. In theory, its counterparties were pro-
tccted by their collateral. But in fact, if the fuud suddenly failed, each
of its counterparties would attempt to sell--in tmison--aud the value
of the collateral would necessarily pluuge. Moreover, each of Long-
Term's swap counterparties would be \"naked,\" or holding on to only
one side of a contract for which the other side\" no longer existed. Each
counterparty would rush to neutralize its one\177sided swaps, over-
whelmiug markets as in a bank run. If that happened, according to
Long-Term, its seventeen biggest countcrparties--banks such asMer-
rill, Goldman, Morgan, and Salomon--would stand to lose a total of
$z.8 billion.
Fisher eyeballed the number and thought, \"'That might be plausi-

ble in a normal market.\" But markets were already sorely frayed;
now they could go totally haywire. Mentally, Fisher adjusted the po-
tential losses to $3 billion to $5billion,and even that was a guess. It
wasn't just Long-Term that was on the hook--it was all of Wall
Street. Who knew when the losses would start to strain the system?
Who knew if the system had a breaking point? The more Fisher
heard, the worse he felt. \"I'm not worried about markets trading
down,\" he confided. \"I'mworried that they won't trade at all.\"
Once the visitors had an overview, the group began to explore
somesolutions. In \17799o, Gensler noted, a bankruptcy filing by
Drexel Burnham Lambert, the junk-bond king, had actually eased the
panic in junk bonds.
But in this case, Rickards explained, bankruptcy would not stop
anything; it would merely ring the bell for counterparties to start
going after their collateral. And the Drexel crisis had inw)lved only
bonds, not derivatives. Long-Term's case was far more complex. It
would be hopeless to try to unravel all those overlapping swaps,
Fisher knew. Furthermore, finding a buyer for the firm was out of the
question. Nobody would touch positions such as equity volatility.
\"So this isa new paradigm,\" Gensler said unhappily.
The partners were particularly agitated about the pressure from
Bear Stearns. What Long-Term needed, Fisher concluded, was
breathing space. After some give-and-take, the arbitrageurs and offi-
cials came up with a plan. Suppose the banks were to visit four days
hence,onThursday, on the understanding that they would be shown
the portfolio in the strictest confidence? After a quick study, the
banks could bid for the assets at an auction the following Sunday.
When markets reopenedMonday, Long-Term would effectively have
disappeared.
But there was one problem with the plan: Long-Term had only
St. 5 billion of equity left, Rickards reminded them. Deducting the
cash locked up at BearStearns and the monies tied up in margin ac-
counts and the like left free cash of exactly $47o million. The com-
pany had been losing hundreds of millions of dollars a day. In all
probability, Long-Term wouldn't make it until Thursday.
And now it was 4 e.m. on Sunday, only hours from the opening of
the Tokyo markets. They had spent six hours working on the prob-
lem and solved nothing. The officials went to a side room, and
Gensler called the Treasury. Midterm elections were six weeks

thus far,the economyhadbeen the government's one bright spot. The
last thing it wanted was a financial meltdown. Rejoining the partners,
Fisher told them, \"You're composed and we're composed, but Wash-
ington is going crazy.\" Then he held out his hand to Meriwether.
J.M. said that, come what may, he wanted to handle the problem
right. \"Thanks,\" Fisher said. \"You're the first one to tell us in ad-
vance.\"
Sunday afternoon, Corzine talked to Buffett, who was still on a
tour of the Alaskan fjords and still seemed uncertain about a rescue
of Long-Term T. hat night, the Goldman chief called Fisher and told
him not to count on a private rescue. Fisher had one thought: \"How
do wegetto another weekend?\"For the first time, he broached the
idea of getting a group of banks together. Corzine, who was feeling
pessimistic about the Buffett bid, encouraged him:'
J. P. Morgan was having similar thoughts. Morgan analysts in
\"l\177kyo and London had spent the past twenty-four hours download-
ing files similar to those that had been seen by Goldman and by the
Fed. Interestingly, the Morgan analysts were surprised that Long-
Term's trades hadn't been moreexotic. They were big but not un-
usual. Still, since Long-Term was known as a bond house, Morgan
wassurprised by the size of its equity book.
Morgan saw two options. Onewas to let the fund fail. Then every
bank would seize collateral for itself; Morgan figured that would cost
the bigger banks $500 million to $700 million apiece. Or, Morgan
could buy big chunks of the portfolio itself. But that would pose an-
other problem. Morgan knew that other banks had seen the portfo-
lio. If any one bank acquired it, it would be in the same spotas
Long-Term--the whole Street would be shooting at it. So all the
banks would have to bein.
Corzine, who had been having thoughts similar to Morgan's,
called Komansky, the Merrill Lynch chairman, Sunday afternoon.
Komansky, who is half Russian Orthodox Jewish, half Irish Catholic,
and too percent The Bronx, was preparing for Rosh Hashanah at
sundown. \"LTCM has some real problems. It looks like they're going
bankrupt in a day or two,\" Corzine told him. He mentioned that
Goldman's people had been in Greenwich--but not that Goldman
had gotten an exclusive peek at Long-Term'sbooks.Nordid he men-
tion that Goldman and Buffett were, at the moment, mulling over a
takeover bid.

Komansky, citing the holiday, rang off and had Herb Allison, his
trusted lieutenant and Merrill's president,pick np the ball. Corzine
was playing golf, but at xo:3o that night, he and Allison connected.
Bit by bit, Wall Street's top bankers were starting to talk to one an-
other.Through their carelessness, their reckless financing, their vain
attempts to ingratiate themselves with a self-important client, the
Wall Street banks had created this fiasco together. Their instinct had
beento savageas much of the carcass of Long-Termaspossible b, ut
now they had begun to see that doing so would risk bringing them-
selves down as well. One by one, they were concluding that they
might have to do the very thing that was most antithetical to their na-
ture: they might have to work together.
Monday, September z\177, was yet another bad day. U.S. swap
spreads climbed to 87; U.K. swaps soared to 95. The sprcad betwccn
on-the-run and off-the-run Treasurys--both of them perfectly safe
U.S. government credits--jumped, incredibly, to \1779points. (Just a
month before, the spread had been the customary 6 points.)Prices
had an air of unreality, as though traders were selling anything con-
nected, even by the faintest rumor, to Long-Term. Banks were \"bend-
ing the marks\" against the fund, grabbing all the collateral they could
while there still was something to grab. Stcvc Black, the Salomon
Smith Barney executive, hcard from his troops in Tokyo that Gold-
man was \"banging the s \" out of Long-Term's trades, especially
swaps. Goldman said Salomon was doing the same in Europe. \177
Around midday, equity volatility jerked up 3 percentage points on
one rather small trade--to 38 percent! Theoptions market was now
implying a catastrophic level of volatility, maybe a crash every
month. To Rosenfeld, it was simply nonsensical; it felt as though
volatility was rising only because traders knew that Long-Term was
vulnerable--which at that point was probably true.' Theobvious ma-
nipulation cost the fund $xzo million. As Vinnv Mattone had proph-
esied, hungry traders were finishing the jobof killing Long-Term that
the crisis in Russia had begun.
Long-Term's total loss on Monday was $553 million, coinciden-
tally equal to its loss of a month before. In percentage terms, this
Monday's losswas far worse: it ate through a third of Long-Term's
equity, leaving it with just under a billion dollars. And the fund still
had more than $ too billion in assets. Thus, even omitting derivatives,
its leverage was greater than zoo to z--a fantastic figure in the an

nals of investment. Now, if Long-Term lost even a mere \177percent
more, it would bewipedout.
Though the magnitude of the loss wouldn't be known until after
the markets closed, the partners knew early in the day that Monday
was high noon. Jim Rickards, the attorney, called Warren Spector,
Bear's executivevicepresident, and threatened to sue if Bear stopped
clearing. The fund had nothing to lose, and Rickards knew it. Then
Rickards called Chaseanddemanded an immediate dispersal of $500
million from the revolver.
Minutes later, the syndicate banks, twenty-four in all, began to
squawk. Rickards and Bruce Wilson, the fund's controller, insisted
that the banks had no choice but to lend the money. But would they
own up to it before the client expired? The stalwart Pflug said that
Chase would fund. What's more, he telexed the other banks and told
them that, in his opinion, they would have to fund as well. Long-
Term got $475 million, most within that day (only Credit Agricole
held out). The loan did nothing for Long-Term's equity, but it was
money in the box at Bear. It bought, perhaps, a few days' time.
At the Fed, Fisher was in touch by phone with Goldman's Corzine
and Thain, Merrill's Allison, and J. P. Morgan's chairman, Douglas
Warner. The calls convinced Fisher that the private efforts to raise
capital were failing--and, what's more, that markets were on the
brink of a disaster. He had a growing sense that the three big
banks should take some collectiveaction. Allison and Corzine spoke
throughout the day. Allison, not as competitive as some of the
traders, naturally gravitated toward a joint approach. Corzine, still
concealing the Buffett card, did so as well, but only as a backstop.
That Monday, Corzine contacted Maurice Greenberg, the chairman
of AIG, the insurer, and convinced him to join the Buffett-Goldman
bid. AIG had the necessary derivatives expertise, and with a third
member, the group would be stronger. Buffett, who was traveling,
was again unreachable, but he had made his strategy clear: buy the
portfolio,let the world see that it was now in strong hands, let prices
recover--and
then sell.
At Morgan, a group involving Mendoza; Peter Hancock, Morgan's
globalbond chief; and Clayton Rose, its headof equities, was think-
ing about going it alone, too. Curiously, Merrill, which had brought
Long-Term into being, was the least well informed of the big three
banks. Allison spent Monday trying to get up to speed.He dispatched

a team to Greenwich via helicopter in the afternoon to find out just
how desperate his client was. Hilibrand and Rosenfeld, who were
working through the Rosh Hashanah holiday, took the visitors
through the portfolio--was there anyone left who had not seen the
books? Meriwether remained remarkably calm, even graceful. \"We
misjudged the markets,\" he admitted.
But J.M. still felt that Long-Term'strades were sound--if it could
just get past the temporary crisis, the momentary implosion of liq-
uidity. J.M. so much wanted the fund to live. He was like a man
about to embrace his lover, if only he can land his plane in a storm.
But the margin calls, the traders shooting at them, the rumormon-
gers, the mercenaries at Goldman ...
The Merrill team was stunned by the huge dimensions of Long-
Term'strades, especially in equities and European swaps (which were
far less liquid than U.S. swaps). \"Do you realizethese are fairly sub-
stantial positions?\" Merrill's Richard Dunn inquired. \177The arbi-
trageurs seemed not to get it. The Merrill people were puzzled by the
mysterious presenceof Goldfield, the ubiquitous Goldman trader; he
was bent over his laptop and didn't look the Merrill people in the eye.
\225
Monday night in London--still afternoon in (;rccnwich--Andy Sicil-
iano, the UBS manager, decided he had to see the hedge fund first-
hand. Hehopped the Concorde and bumped into Victor Haghani on
the flight. Though both were jet-lagged by the time they arrived, nei-
ther man had any intention of sleeping. They shared a limousine to
Greenwich, where .I.M., Rosenfeld, and the laureates were holding
court in the conference room. Goldman was still in the building, like
an invading army that had establishedabeachhead. In the conference
room, a bunker mentality prevailed. The partners couldn't stop talk-
ing about how the Goldman traders were calling New York on their
cell phones--though of course they couldn't know what the traders
were saying. But the notion that a conspiracyhad done them in had
become an obsessionfor the partners. When they finished with Gold-
man, they heaped their fury on Bear ,Stearns, disingenuously implying
that Bear had sprung its letter out of the blue. Conver\177iently forget-
ring how disdainful they had bee\177 before, the partners abjectly won-
dered why their friends had abandoned them2
Rosenfeld went over the portfolio for what seemed the hundredth

time, sizing up the prospects trade by trade. Siciliano, the only out-
sider, realized with a start that no oneobjected to his presence. Long-
Term had no secretsnow. In fact, Siciliano was strangely welcome.
Hewas a bridge to the outside world the firm had shunned but now
so desperately needed. The partners implored Siciliano to help, to
spread the word of their positions' inherent logic--anything for cap-
ital.Theywere still selling. But a faint odor of self-delusioncolored
their confabulations. The theme of revengebubbled beneath the sur-
face like the curd ofsour milk: if only Long-Term could throw fresh
capital into the breach, prices would snap back and those nasty op-
portunists who had traded against them would be begging for mercy.
By Monday, market gossips were attributing every slight dip in
prices to selling from Greenwich. But the general press had been stun-
ningly silent. Since the day after Meriwether's September z letter, the
press hadn't breathed aword on the runaway hedge fund. Wall Street
pundits were preoccupied with the expectedrelease of a videotape of
President Clinton's testimony in the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal,
which was said to be depressingmarkets. Fisher was of the opinion
that sex had nothing to do with what was depressing Wall Street. In
his opinion, Long-Term was weighing on markets like a corpse.
After talking with the banks, Fisher concluded that Wall Street
would be willing to participate in a rescue, but given the bankers'
mutual distrust and competitive predispositions, none would take the
risk of initiating one. That would leave it to the Fed. Corzine, still
hedging his bets, had the same thought. Should Goldman's exclusive
bid fall through, he wanted to avoid a competitive free-for-all.He
would much prefer to join hands undcr thc Fed's protective banner.
And Herb Allison was pushing Fisher to bring some banks together
on neutral ground.- Sensing that time was running out, Fisher invited
the big three banks to breakfast at the Fed.
Fisher maintained that neither he nor McDonough was worried
about the loss to Long-Term, nor even about the potential loss to
other firms. If the estimate of $\177billion to $5 billion over seventeen
banks were correct, losses of up to $\177oo million per firm were cer-
tainly tolerable. Even if they \177vere trot tolerable, these private Wall
Street banks had put their own shareholders' money at risk; they had
no call for help from the Federal Reserve.
Fisher's concern was the broader notion of \"systemic risk\": if
long-Term failed, and if its creditors forced a hasty and disorderly

liquidation, he feared that it would harm the entire financial system,
not just some of its big participants. Greenspan later used the phrase
\"a seizing up of markets,\" conjuring up the image of markets in such
disarray that they might cease to function--meaning that traders
would cease to trade. * McDonough evoked a parallel fear--that
losses in so many markets and to so many players would spark a vi-
cious circleof liquidations, extreme fluctuations in interest rates, and
then still further losses: \"Markets would.., possiblycease to func-
tion for a period ofoneor more days and maybe longer. ''\177
Since the Great I)epression, the United States has not experienced
anything like a real meltdown, though at times markets have seemed
to be spinning toward one. But the fear of a financial Armageddon
has inspired an imaginative literature that at the extreme has its par-
allel in natural-disaster plots, mass-computer-failurseagas, and the
like. In the abstract, no one can say whether systemic risk presentsa
real threat--the very phrase is vagueand ill defined--but regulators
naturally err toward caution. As Fisher readied to meet his guests,
Asia was already in the throes of a recession if not a depression; Rus-
siawasmost certainly falling into one; and South America was on the
brink. In the United States, the vast widening in credit spreads sug-
gested that lenders were refusing to lcnd--a classic sign of a contrac
tion. The previous day, September -I, Treasury yields had t(mcheda
low of 5.05 percent. According to an economist quoted in The Wall
Street Journal, \"Treasurys are purely a measure of fear now\"--fear
of holding any bond that was not a TreasuryY' Stocks had phmged
everywhere from Switzerland to Brazil to Singapore. Stepping back
from Wall Street, Fisher would havenoticed that America's economy
was still quite vibrant (unlike in the fall of \1779z9, when, by the time
of the Great Crash on Wall Street, it was already m recession). In-
deed,most Americans \177verc unaware that the financial crisis--which
Secretary Rubin said was the worst in half a century--even existed. \177
But it certainly existed in the mind of the Fed.
\225
Fisher's guests--Komansky and Allison from Merrill, Corzine and
Thain from Goldman, and Mendoza from J. P. Morgan--arrived at
7:3 \260that morning. If an executive's mood may be surmised from
price of his stock, Fisher's visitors must have been dour indeed.

Morgan's was off by more than 4\260percent. Goldman had not yet
gone public--which meant that Corzine's mood was probably the
worst of anyone's. In such a market, Goldman couldhavenohope of
selling stock.
Fisher said he had spent Sunday at I.ong-Term and was worried
about systemicrisk. The bankers were sympathetic. Merrill Lynch
was in something close to shock--not over Long-Term but over its
own spiraling losses in bonds. Merrill, which had purposely shied
away from arbitrage-type operations, had never dreamt that it could
beso vulnerable. Morgan, though in better shape,had been having a
terrible quarter. Goldman was on its way to a stunning (except in
comparison with Long-Term) trading lossfor August and September
of $\177.5 billion. Thus, when Fisher suggested that the system was in
danger, his guests, without necessarily pondering the fine points of
global capitalism, were, at least for their own reasons, more than
ready to believe him.
Each bank floated a different possible solution. Corzine revealed
that Goldman knew of a prospective bidder--a \"Mr. Big\"--who was
waiting in the wings. Mendoza of Morgan proposed an intricate
scheme xvhereby the banks with debt exposure to Long-Term could
\"lift\" (that is, acquire) its bond trades andthose with equity exposure
could divvy up its equity trades. Komansky, who owned a slug of
Long-Term himself, thought this was far too conw)luted and time-
consuming. He and Allison favored a simple consortium that would
make an investment.
But no solution could work if I.ong-Term's equity continued to
melt away. The banks had to stop their traders from shooting at the
fund, one of the bankersadmitted. Komansky said gruffly, \"Well, just
tell the yuppies to sit down and shut up.\" The comment may have
been directed to Corzine. Komansky said later that while he didn't
specifically recall the remark, he had heard that Goldman's traders
had downloaded \"all of I.ong-Term's positions\" into their own com-
puters, which Goldmanofcoursedenied. In any case, the speculation
about Goldman's trading had surfaced among the top executives. \"I
don't know anybody who knew it as a fact,\" Komansky said. \"But
the issue was there.\" \177-'
The bankers adiourned around 9:3o, agreeing to send two groups
to Long-Termto investigate the Morgan approach. One would ex-
plore lifting Long-Term's bond positions; the other, its equities. A

third group, led by Allison, would retreat to Merrill Lynch to study
the consortium idea. Also, they agreed to invite UBS, Long-Term's
biggest investor, to join them.
Meriwether greeted the bankers with aplomb, but Hilibrand
looked haggard and nervous; the losses had taken a toll on the mas-
ter trader, who wasalsoso personally leveraged. By now, meetings
betweenLong-Term and inquiring bankers had a staged, too-familiar
air.The partners were weary of reluctant suitors; what's more, mar-
kets were moving so fast that the bankers had no way of knowing
what the portfolio was worth. Conservatively valuing the portfolio at
a discount, the bankers arrived at bids for the various pieces that
added to little more than zero. Haghani seemedwounded by their
minimal valuations. \"Thank you for coming,\" he told a Merrill
banker with an air of rebuke, \"but we don't think you're right. You
ought to be investing with us.\" He was like a drowning man trying
to dictate terms to a rescuer on shore; in his heart of hearts, he was
unsinkable.
But Long-Term had sustained another lossTuesday of $\1775\177mil-
lion, taking its equity down to $773 million. JimmyCayne, chief ex-
ecutive of Bear Stearns, advised Fisher that Long-Term had enough
cashto get through Tuesday--but Wednesday could be a problem. \177
What could it possibly do in twenty-four hours? The Morgan option
was dead. Corzine doubted that \"Mr. Big\" would surface, either.
That left it to Allison.
Allison, a fifty-five-year-old investment banker, was a rarity among
top executives at Merrill, most of whom had been plucked from the
firm's legion of stockbrokers. The prototypical Merrill man was Ko-
mansky, a personable, heavyset former broker who had never gotten
a college diploma but had starred in sales. Allison, a philosophy
major at Yale with an M.B.A. from Stanford, was far more bookish.
Wispy, balding, and bespectacled,he was more a detail man than a
rainmaker and--despite his ambition--a consummate number two.
Undeniably smart, he had a talent for deconstructing a deal and fit-
ting the parts into working order. Tuesday afternoon, holed up in a
conference room overlooking the Statue of Liberty, Allison and a
smallcadre of bankers hammered away at aplan. By 4 \177'.M., when the
four banks and Fisher hooked up in a conference call, Allison hz\177d
worked up a succinct outline, on three quarters of a page, for a \177,,,\177
sortium.

==================================================

For Allison's plan to have any chance, it would need the support
of most of the banks on Wall Street. Moreover, he explained to Fisher,
the only way to get the banks together was for the Fed to call them
and offer to hold a meeting. '\177Fisher agreed. While insisting that the
Fed was not backing any particular approach, the regulator swung
into action behind the Merrill plan. Around 6 P.M., Fisher and some
aides called the dozen banks that--along with Merrill, Morgan,
Goldman, and UBS--were l.ong-Term's biggest counterparties and
announced an emergency meeting at the Fed at eight that evening.
McDonough, who had beenspeaking to international regulators in
London about the dangers of derivatives, was in touch by phone. By
nightfall in t,ondon, McDonough was jetting back to New York.
Bankers from the Big Four banks met with Fisher at seven. Alli-
son's plan called for the sixteen banks to invest $z5o million each.
Thain had insisted on the $4 billion total--anything less, and the
portfolio would come under attack. But the bankers disagreed on
everything else. Should the package be equity or--as the more gun-
shy bankers proposed--a temporary loan? Should the l,ong-Term
partners be allowed to stay, or should they he fired? If they did stay,
who would control the fund? Corzine strongly argued that the Long-
Term partners should forfeit control. At 8:20, the four lead banks
were still debating. Meanwhile, the chief executives of the other big
banks had begun to arrive and were cooling their heels outside the
boardroom.
Fisher calleda halt, opened the massive wooden doors, and invited
the others in. It was an awesome gathering, the cream of Wall Street.
Fisher spied Deryck Maughan, co-chief executive of Salomon Smith
Barney; Thomas Labrecque, president of Chase; Jimmy Cayne, the
CEO of Bear Stearns; Allen Wheat, chief executiveof CreditSuisse
First Boston; Philip Purcell, chairman of Morgan Stanley Dean Wit-
ter; and senior executives from Lehman Brothers and Bardays of
Britain. From the Big Four, Fisher saw Komansky, Allison, Corzine,
Thain, Warner, Mendoza, Rose, and David Solo. Twelve banks had
sent twenty-five bankers--all men, all middle-aged. Even these thick-
necked bankers, though familiar to one another, were unaccustomed
to seeing so many of their brethren on such short noticeand in such
a place, squeezed into soft, leather-backed chairs under the quiet gaze
of the gold-framed oil portraits that rimmed the boardroom. Mor-
gans's Sandy Warner broke the ice, jovially declaring, \"Boys, we're
going to a picnicand the tickets cost $250 million.\"



==================================================
                     PAGE 208                     
==================================================

Fisher, though a bureaucrat who earned a pittance of what his
guests did, commanded their attention because he alone could repre-
sent the \"public interest\" that now seemedso imperiled. Fisher spoke
for just a few minutes. He said the Fed was interested in seeing
whether the private sector could fred a solution that would avoid a
chaotic liquidation--one that would spare the system. Otherwise
headopted a neutral stance, intentionally staying aloof from the par-
ticulars. Allison said, \"It was like he had rented out a hall.\" Of
course, Fisher had done more than that. The Fed does not invite the
heads of Wall Street to its boardroom every day, and the executives
knew it.
Gazing about the room, Thomas Russo's first thought was awe--
a fleeting satisfaction at being part ofsuchagroup. As the debate got
under way, Russ(), the chief legal officer for Lehman, becamecon-
scious of an irony. \"When you get to a high level, how much do you
really understand about the details under you?\" he wondered. They
had all been trained to exercisedue diligence, but none had been
trained for an emergency like this.
Allison summarized his plan, and eachof the lead banks spoke in
favor. Komansky said, \"It's not my first choice of what to do with the
money, but I think it's the right thing.\" Komansky didn't bother to
add that he was scared that if t,ong-Term collapsed, Merrill's aston-
ishing trading losses would spiral out ofcontrol. The other bankers
were worried, too. But Lehman objected that it shouldn't be asked
for the same contribution as the bigger banks--why shouldn't each
bank invest according to its exposure? Thain retorted that that was
toocomplicated--there wasn't time. Each bank now beganto jockey
for its particular interest. Chase's Labrecque fired a shot at Bear for
precipitating the crisis. Bear still held the trigger, he knew. Cayne,
whose firm had earned $3\260million a year clearing for Long-Term,
and who was personally an investor in the fund, was notably silent.
Then the bankers vented their ire at Long-Term.They had taken
all they wanted to from the gang in Greenwich. For four years, th(-
partners had held themselvesaloof, picking off the best trades from
eachof the banks and not even trying to hide their smug st.pcri\177,,\177v.
Now the partners had the look of false prophets. The ba\177kcrs h'h
taken--they had been socredulous. Several said the partners sh,\177ul,I
be fired. Why give them the money? Allison and (iorziu(' \177cpc.\177w,ll\177

dealing). Meriwether sounded mortified to hear of the anger directed
at him. \"Look, I'll help howeverI can,\" he murmured.
Goldman's Thain, who had the most intimate knowledge of Long-
Term, described the portfolio risks. The group agreed that any invest-
ment should be in the form of equity, but no one beyond the four lead
firms was ready to commit. Most of the banks thought they would
lose less than $250 million if Long-Term failed; why throw good
money after bad? Allison said that the fallout could be truly scary,
even worse than after Russia.Long-Term had $ioo billion of assets
and $ \17t7rillion in notional derivative exposure,hereminded the group.
Moreover, its equity positionswerespooky S. ome investors would
not be in stocks were it not for the insurance policy provided by op-
tions, and Long-Termwaseasily the biggest supplier. Without Long-
Term, it was possible that investors would back away from stocks.
None of the bankers wanted to see the stock market tumble further.
Pflug felt a pervasive fear in the room. Then he had the depressing
thought that it was his birthday and he was spending it locked in a
conference room.
Around ii e.M., Fisher suggested they break until ten the next
morning. Allison and a Merrill colleague, TomDavis, returned to the
office to redraft the terms. Now and then, to resolvea fine point, they
called Meriwether, who was keeping vigil in Greenwich. Around
i A.M., Allison updated Corzine and Mendoza; Allison wanted no
surprises on Wednesday. At 3 A.M., when the business day in Paris
began, Allison faxed the new terms to Long-Term's French counter-
parties. Then he went home. The next day, he would need each of the
banks to commit. He wondered if it could be done. \177No one had ever
raised$4 billion in a day before.
Merrill had realized it would also need some lawyers in a hurry.
Philip Harris, a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flora,
Merrill'soutside law firm, had worked on Long-Term during its ini-
tial fund-raising, but Harris, who specialized in investment funds,
wanted a workout specialist, too. At 2:30 A.M., Harris called a Skad-
den partner named J. Gregory Milmoe, waking him at his home in
Scarsdale. Milmoe, a fifty-year-old soft-spoken attorney with white
hair and gold-rimmed glasses, specialized in bankruptcy. A former
piano player, Milmoe had gotten a job in Skadden's mail room and
later goneto lawschool. \"Something has come up,\" Harris said. \"We
need you.\"

Milmoe promised he'd be in first thing in the morning.
\"No,\" Harris explained. \"We need you to come in now.\"
Milmoeshowered,dressed a, nd hopped into his Volvo. Hecruised
into Manhattan at the city's quietest hour. By 3:3 \26,0he reached the
gleaming black skyscraper where Skadden had its headquarters and
went to work.
\225
McDonough, who had just arrived from 1,ondon, got to the Fed early
Wednesday. Pushcarts were jostling for streetspace with stretch lim-
ousines, which moved at a pondcrouspace through the narrow al-
leyways. The Federal Reserve buihling h\177omcd above, its high outcr
wall rising to a vacant balcony, as if the architcct had wantcd to con
vey both the ceremony of apalace and the implacability of a fortress.
McDonough called his peers at European central banks, notifying
them of the crisis. Fisher, his colleague, took a call from JimmyCayne
at Bear Stearns. Cayne, whose firm had little exposure, said Bear
would not contribute to any rescue. Fisher pleaded with Cayne to
keepan open mind. Caync said darkly, \"Don't go alphabetically if
you want this to work.\"
At lO a.M., the bankers returned. Wednesday's gathering was
larger, about forty-five in all. Thc group was a who's who of Wall
Street power brokers: Sandy Wcill, Komansky, (\177orzine, Chase's
Labrecque, Morgan's Warner, Credit Suisse First Boston's Wheat, and
Richard Fuld, chairman of Lehman Brothers. Rounding out the spec-
tacular assembly were executives from five Swiss, British, and French
banks as well as Richard Grasso, chairman of the New York Stock
Exchange, who had been summoncd due to Long-Tcrm's monster
trade in equity volatility. Edson Mitchcll ofDeutsche Bank was c(m-
nected by phone. As they filed into the boardroom, the bankers no-
ticed the portrait of George Washington above an antique clock on
the mantel, alongside those of McDonough's predecessors. The cu>
rains were drawn. The elegant, black-mlnmed mahogany table was
too small to accolnmodate such a crowd; a larger cover had been
hastily shrug over it.'\"
The boardroom itself was an add-on, the Fed having acquired it

times had agreed to sell.Thejokewas that the Fed had
the stock market crash to get hold of the space. The i\177k\177'

a sting, since the Fed's failure to curb stock speculation on margin
debt early in \1779z9 has ever since been viewedasa singular missed
opportunity--one that might have averted the crash and, perhaps,
the ensuing Great Depression. It was this sort of debacle--albeit on a
lesserscale--that McDonough was seeking to prevent with Long-
Term Capital.
However, McDonoughwas not in the boardroom. The l%d presi-
dent was closeted in an anteroom with the executivesof the four lead
banks, who had becomeasort of roving Security Council to the other
banks' General Assembly. It was a warm morning, and the other
CEOs, not accustomed to being kept waiting, were becoming impa-
tient.
At To:zs, McDonough, a burly, sixty-four-year-old Chicagoan
with thinning silver hair and thick arching eyebrows, suddenly ap-
pearedand said he was suspending the meeting until \177I'.\1771.He added
cryptically, \"Not all avenues have been exhausted,\" but refused to
elaborate. The CEOs were dumbfounded and absolutely at a loss. As
they learned later, about ten minutes into the meeting of the Big Four,
Corzine and Thain had pulled McDonough aside, pleading a sudden
new development: Buffett was ready to bid. \"I thought we were in
this together!\" Solo snapped angrily. But McDonough could not pass
up this seeming godsend; he much preferred a solution that did not
involve the Fed..lust to make sure it was real, he called Buffett, who
was now at a Montana ranch. Buffett confirmed that an offer wason
the way. In the main room, the CEOs rose with a look of disgust.
Theywere furious at Goldman for dealing behind their backs. Even
Komansky felt that Corzine had played it too close to the vest.
While Kraus, Goldman's investment banker, prepared a written
offer, Buffett placed a callto Meriwether. \"John,\" he said in his un-
mistakable twang, \"you're going to get a bid for the portfolio with
my name on it. 1 just want you to know that it's me.\" Meriwether
was noncommittal.
Therewasa hiatus while G<)ldman dotted the i's and crossed the
t's. Finally, at \17\177:74o, Meriwether pulled a one-page fax from the ma-
chine. It said that Berkshire Hathaway, AI(;, and GoldmanSachs
would be willing to buy the fund for $zso millions. If accepted, they
would immediately invest $3.7s billion more to stabilize the opera-
tion, with $3 billion of the total coming from Berkshire.
Buffett was proposing to pay $\1775o million for a fund that had

==================================================

AT THE FED \225203
been worth $4-7 billion at the start of the year. By day's end, Long-
Term, which was suffering yet another down day in markets, would
be worth only $5 55 million. But evennextto this startlingly reduced
net \177vorth, Buffett's offer was decidedly cheap.The partners--worth
hundreds of millions apiece only weeks earlier--would be wiped out.
What's more, they would be fired.Also, just to make sure that Meri-
wether would not shop his offer around, Buffett issued a deadline of
t\177:3o \177,..\1771n.,ot quite an hour away. Meriwether handed the fax to
Rickards. \"What do wedo with it?\" J.M. asked.
To Meriwether, the proposal must have been an especially bitter
pill. J.M. was furious at Goldman and AIG for trading against the
fund--indeed, for helping to knock it down3 before trying to buy it on
the cheap. Moreover, the proposal would reenact the central trauma
of.l.M.'s career: losing his company, and his job, to Warren Buffett.
Nonetheless, the partners studied it with care. UBS's Siciliano, who
was with the partners again that day, was impressed by their mood
ofearnestness Th. eir first concern, Siciliano believed, was to fashion
aclean solution that would avoid a generalized catastrophe. Buffett's
bid, at least, could provideone.
Unfortunately, Rickards saw problems with the bid. It was mistak-
enly worded asan offerto buy the assets of LTCM--the management
company--which Buffett did not want.' John Mead, Goldman's
counsel at Sullivan & Cromwell, explained to Rickards that Buffett
was really after the fund's portfolio. The portfolio's assets--the stocks,
bonds, and so forth--could of course besold at any time. Not so its
derivative contracts, because the partieson the other side would have
to approve. Moreover, one of Buffett's conditions was that the port-
folio's financing remain in place. As Rickards read it, Buffett would
have to buy the portfolio company--that is,Long-TermCapital Port-
folio, the Cayman Islands partnership. But LTCP was merely the hub
in the original, complicated feederstructure. The hub was owned by
eight separate spokes and by its general partner and, according to
Rickards, was absolutely unsalable without a change in the partner-
ship agreement, which would need the consent of the investors in
each of the spokes. In short, Rickards said, the bid was anonstarter.
However,he thought it would work in a different form--if the
Berkshiregroup simply invested in the fund as it was currently strut
tured. And Buffett, as the biggest investor, would still be free to fir\177'
the partners.

==================================================

204 \225WHEN GENIUS FAILED
But Mead did not have authority to change the bid, and Buffett
was bizarrely unreachable. Indeed, one wonders how badly he
wanted Long-Term. In the past, Buffett's ability to do complex deals
on a single sheet of paper had been one of his charms, and this
proposal--all of five paragraphs--certainly bore his trademark. But
perhaps his bid for l.ong-Termwastoo simple or too arbitrary, for it
could not accommodate the fund's more subtle particulars. More-
over, Kraus, the investment banker, who might have set Buffett
straight, had himself been inexplicably unfamiliar with l.ong-Term's
structure and had sorely mishandled the bid.
Mead, Goldman's outside lawyer, was left with little choice. At
\177z:zo, Mead told Rickards the bid was withdrawn, and Rickards
walked back to J.M.'s office and said, \"The Buffett bid is off the
table.\" Meriwether immediately called McDonough--truly his last
hope. \"OK,\" McDonough said, \"1'11 call the banks, but Idon't know
if they're coming back or not.\"
J.M. was later said to have deliberately scotched the Buffett bid,
figuring that he could do better with McDonough. This version,
though, credits .I.M. with a rather full understanding of a confused
and quickly moving drama. It is true that Meriwether did not attempt
to resolve the legal problems, and such complications are often
worked out later on, after an agreement in principle has beensigned.
But Buffett was not exactly being flexibleeither. At noon Wednesday,
J.M. could not assume that Buffett would agree to anything outside
the terms of his letter. Perhaps the harshness of its terms or some faint
element of personal mistrust deterredJ.M. from pursuing Buffett fur-
ther, but what .I.M. did know was that for the consortium effort to
have any chance, it had to return to the Fed--and quickly.
The bankers came back at one, in a sullen mood. Goldman's
minuet had reminded them of how little they trusted one another.
They didn't want to be there; they had no stake in Long-Term. Pur-
cell, chairman of Morgan Stanley, saw little risk to his bank if the
fund collapsed. Sandy Weill had just shut down his own arbitrage
unit--why save someone else's? Wcill hadn't even returned (he
was represented by Deryck Maughan and Jamie Dimon). Credit
Suisse First Boston was skeptical, too. Labrecque of Chasesaid he
would go in only if the bank syndicate's loan wererepaid. Allison and
Komansky were still in favor of a deal, but now they doubted it was
possible.

AT THE FED \225205
The bankers debated the likelihood of systemic collapse but got
nowhere. It was a parlor topic, not something the bankers wanted to
spend $z5o million on. Lehman Brothers simply couldn't afford it.
Lehman's own stability was the subiect ofwhispers in the Street, and
its funding costs had been soaring. Dick Fuld, l,ehman's chairman,
bluntly asked Corzine if Goldman's buyer had backed away on ac-
count of price--and if so, why should the consortium offer more?
Corzine said there had been legal issues.TheCEOs listened sourly\177
who knew what to believe?McDonough was mostly silent.
It was Allison's meeting now. The numbers man decidedto take a
poll. Bankers Trust said it was m.... Barclays was in.
All eyes darted to thc hulking (iaync, slouching next to Spcctor\177 his
colleague. The Bear CEOsaid, \"We called this morning to tell people
we wouldn't be in.\" There was a deathly silence.Then, in unison, the
CEOs demanded an explanation. This only made Cayne more res-
olute. Bear had enough exposure as a clearing agent, Cayne said.He
wouldn't say more. The others thought it ludicrous. Bear was hold-
ing $5oo million--it was the least exposed. \"They had a different
view ofthe world,\" one participant said acidly. \"They'recompletely
self-interested.\" Suddenly these paragons of individual enterprise
seethed with communitarian fervor.Purcellof Morgan Stanley turned
beet red. He fumed, \"It's not acceplal\177le that a \177najor Wall Street firm
isn't participating!\"'\" It was as if Bear were breaking a silent code; it
would pay a price in the future, Allison w)wed.
McDonough asked the Bear team to come into McDonough's of-
fice. \"You have to say something,\" McDonough noted. \"Komansky
is really upset.\" A moment later Komanskycame in, and he was crim-
son. Turning to Cayne, the Merrill chiefexploded: \"What the iCucte
are you doing?\" Cayne wondered, \"When did we become partners?\"
Komansky put a sort of Lyndon Johnson arm around him, and Spec-
tor tried to get in the middlc so Caync wouldn't have to deal with all
of Komansky's zSo pounds himself.
Something grated on Caync--the faint suggestion that he was
being viewed with dishonor. He said to Komansky, \"If you go back
in that room and say you've known Bear Stearns for years and that
we're an honorable firm, we will say that, as clearing agent, wedon't
have any special knowledge that makes us uncomfortable. We just
choose not to participate.\" And they went back and said their pieces.
Then, the focus shifted to Long-Term. Corzine said the partners

were expendable. \"We don't need these guys; they created this mess,\"
Corzine said. No one exactly sympathized with Meriwether, but
Allen Wheat of Credit Suisse First Boston said it would bea mistake
to fire him. If the Street invested all this money in the fund, they
would need someone to run it. And the guys in Greenwich obviously
knew it better than anyone.
Corzine, though, insisted Chat the consortium at least had to get
full control, including the right to fire J.M. and the other partners. It
would need contracts locking the partners in and strict supervision
over trading limits. Corzine went from one extreme to the other--
now wanting J.M. as his partner, now wanting him in shackles. But
he understood the flaws in Long-Term better than anyone else. The
firm had no controls, no one above the level of trader. Insisting that
Goldman would never invest without accountability, Corzine called
Meriwether to make sure he would swallow the terms; otherwise,
Goldman was out.
The others could sense that Corzine was under a special strain.
Thain, his lieutenant, was getting calls on his cell phone right in the
Fedroom.No one could hear what Thain was saying, but they could
see anguish written on his face. Goldman's losses were big; its IPO
was on the rocks, its partners were unhappy. Corzine had the look of
a man caught between two armies.
Aside from Corzine, others of the bankers continually left the
room. The Europeans called home; the Americans checked their of-
fices. Perhaps, some of the bankers called their traders. Detailsof the
meeting leaked.
At Long-Term there was radiosilence I. ts markets were tumbling,
especially its equity volatility trade. The latest quote was41 percent!
It almost didn't matter now. The firm had come to a halt. Trading
had ceased, the phones were finally quiet. There was no one to call;
the people the partners had been talking to all these weeks were in
the Fed room.
The partners waited together in the glass-walled conference room.
Every so often, Allison or Corzinewould callJ.M. with a question,
and the partners would infer a bit of progress. Outside,a group of
the nonpartners stood by a television monitor, hoping for a glimpse
of the story that had been unfolding for weeks on the other side of
the glass. Around 3 P.M.,CNBC revealed what was going on at the
Fed, in surprising detail. Haghani came out, and Reisman, the repo

man, said, \"They're going to bail you out.\" Haghani thanked him
and walked off.
In the Fed room, the issuecame down to money. Allison had fig-
ured on sixteen banks at $z5o million apiece. But the French banks
wouldn't go above $rz5 million each. Lehman was stuck on $\177oo
million. Bear was a zero. Allison had counted Salomon Smith Barney
and Citicorp as two banks, but Citi, reckoning that it was about to
merge with Salomon, hadn't shown. Pflug said Citi should be there,
but Deryck Maughan told him to mind his own business.
By 4 I'.M., the chance was slipping away. They weren't even close
to $4billion. Allison, seeing no other option, hiked the ante to $300
million. This was embarrassing for Corzinc, who had to call his
Goldman partners for consent. Peter Karches of Morgan Stanley
sneered, \"What do you mean? You're the boss!\" The bankerssus-
pected Corzine of looking for an out, but Corzine fully accepted that
Wall Street's leaders should do their bit. His partners, who had a
lessersense of history, did not. They were loath to invest when Gold-
man itself was seeking capital, and they were distracted by the fac-
tional rivalries tearing at Goldman's fabric.To Allison, Corzine cut a
tortured figure--angry at LTCM for its irresponsibility, which had
put him into this difficult spot, and under intense pressure from his
partners but still trying to do the right thing. He and Thain were eye-
ing each other warily. At one point, Thain got off the phone and
whispered into his ear. Corzine plaintively turned to the group and
said, \"My partners really don't want to do this.\"
Despite his shaky support, Corzine went ahead. Now, with eleven
banks at $300 million, plus the French and Lehman, $3.65 billion
had been raised. Counting Long-Term's still remaining sliver of eq-
uity, it would have $4 billion of capital in total. Itow much of that
should be apportioned to l,ong-Term's original investors? Some said
zero, but Allison said the l\177ong-\177l\177.'rmpartakers would have to be given
an incentive. After all, they would bc m\177maging the banks' money.
The other issuewas how l(,\177g to invest for. The bankers wanted
their money back quickly, but if thc co\177sortium were perceived as
transitory, other traders would start shooting at it. Tobecredible th, e
consortium needed staying power. The bankers agreed on a three-
part agenda: reduce the fund's risk level, return capital to the new in-
vestors, and--last--try to realize a profit. To a man, the bankers
would be happy just to get out whole.

==================================================

208 \225WHEN GENIUS FAILED
At 5:\1775 P.M., Allison called Meriwether with the terms. Long-Term
would be getting $3.65 billion from a new \"spoke\" representing
fourteen banks. In exchange, the banks would receive 9o percent of
the equity of the fund. Long-Term'sexisting investors would retain a
\177opercent interest, worth about $4oo million. But the partners' share
of the latter would be totally subsumed by the debts against them-
selvesand LTCM. In short, their investment in Long-Term--once
worth $\177.9 billion--was totally gone, most of it lost in a mere five
weeks. The details of the new arrangement had yet to be ironed out,
though it was clear that, at least for the next three years (the consor-
tium's expected life), the partners' fees would be cut and their man-
agement and operating freedomwould be severely curtailed.
Komansky thought the rival banks had done noble work, though
of course they had saved their own hides and not just Meriwether's.
What the bankers had donewaschoosea certain risk of $300 million
over the mere possibility of a losswhose magnitude was unknowable.
It signified that the bankers had--finally--lost their appetite forgam-
bling.
Shortly after seven, they handed a press release to a mob of re-
porters. The release would affect events in an unexpected way, for it
communicated to the world a levelof finality that this complex deal
did not yet possess.
The press naturally focused on the role of the Federal Reserve Sys-
tem in orchestrating the bailout. -''\17A7ccording to the next day's New
York Times, the Fed had stretchedthe doctrine of \"too big to fail\" to
apply to a high-risk, speculative hedge fund. The Times story, which
buried the fact that no public money was involved, immediately put
the Fed on the defensive.The implication that the Fed was eventac-
itly assuming responsibility for private, unregulated funds was highly
disturbing. As a former Treasuryofficial notedelsewhere, \"What if
George Soros has aproblem?\":' The Wall Street Journal editorialized
that the rescue continued a decade-long pattern of shielding private
investors from the effects of their mistakes--each instance of which
emboldened investors to make still further mistakes. \177'
By the day after the rescue, there was already aclamor for a gov-
ernment investigation, both into Long-Term and into hedge funds in
general. \177'\A17s7 if to underscore the damage that hedge funds could
cause,UBS humbly announced that it was writing off its entire in-
vestment in Long-Term. The \"strategic relationship\" that Mathis

Cabiallavetta had hoped would revitalize UBS had ended up costing
the bank $700 million.
Commentators took wicked delight in the fall of the high and
mighty Long-Term, with its superrich traders, its esoteric mathemat-
ics, and its acclaimed laureates. The Financial Times of l\177ondon ob-
served, \"If [David] Mullins enjoyed fixing crises so much, he must be
a very happy man.'''4 The general, and understandable, reaction was
one of horror that the Fed was coming to the rescue of the hero of
Liar'sPoker.
For Meriwether, it was a horror of a different sort. Everything he
had done since the scandal at Salomon had been,at least in his mind,
aimed at restoring his reputation and carccr. Now it bad all come
crashing down. The most inward of men, Mcriwcthcr had becomea
public figure identified with the arrogance, greed, a\177d speculative
folly of Wall Street taken to staggering excess. He and his devotedar-
bitrageurs were the authors of ahistoric collapse,one that had threat-
ened the entire system.Cameracrewsdescendeodn Greenwich, and
television helicopters buzzed the firm's formerly tranquil offices.
Meriwether was at leastspared the suggestion of personal dishonor,
but otherwise late September was for him the worst kind of \177light-
mare. He retained his uncanny calm, though one wondered if it
masked a certain detachment from his tragedy, tlis only public utter-
ance was a one-sentence remark, released through his press agent, i\177a
which he blandly expressed appreciation for the consortium's capital.
In fact, the consortiumdealwas anything but assured, as the banks
first had to resolve a host of sticky issues. One set related to J.M. and
his partners a\177ld how tightly the banks couldcontrol them. Another
revolved around the fund's shaky finances: the consortium condi-
tioned the deal on getting waivers from every (\177ncof l\177(mg-Term's nu-
merous lenders.Thebanks wcrc petrified theft t'vc\177 after the infusion
of new capital, a single default would trigger a chaita reaction and
topple the
fund.
Also, each of the banks had to examine--andcome to under-
stand--the fund well enough to persuade its own board to go ahead
with the deal. When this was done, they would need a contract.
And it all had to happen by M(\177nday, September z8, the scheduled
closingdate--only five days away. Normally, the process takes
months, but Long-Term was still hanging by a thread. \"It was amad
rush,\" said Tom Bell, the outside counsel from Simpson Thacher &

Bartlett, \"to see whether we would close the dealor run out of money
first.\"
Skadden, Arps, Merrill'slaw firm, was naturally hired to represent
the consortium. Merrill offered to make Sullivan & Cromwell, Gold-
man's law firm, co-counsel, but the cageyGoldmandidn't want its at-
torneys working for anyone else.Nonetheless, Goldman insisted that
Sullivan's John Mead be present for the negotiations. This set up an
interesting dynamic. While Milmoe, the pleasant-mannered Skadden
partner, had to mediatefor the entire consortium, Mead negotiated
strictly for Goldman. A graying, forty-six-year-old litigator, Mead
had a soft oval face and double chin that masked a brutally tough
style. Right from the start he took a hard line, pushing Milmoe to
make sure that the contract restricted the Long-Term partners as
much as possible and otherwise protected the consortium's interests.
This was fortunate for the banks, because the partners were hoping
to win back through negotiations what they had lost in the market-
place. Incredibly, Meriwether and his cohorts werealready plotting a
new hedge fund--the partners' only chance of resurrection--as if
Long-Term could be put behind them like a bad trade.
Meanwhile, a tempest was brewing on the fund's trading floor.
Staffers,who had beenwiped out too, were fast becoming embit-
tered. Now that the fund had collapsed\177 they were demanding expla-
nations\177 the partners \17c7ontinued unwillingness to discuss the furore
seemed like so much vanity. Matt Zames, a young trader who was
about to get married and had lost his investment\177 burst into one of
the partner's offices. \"No one's giving me answers!\" he ranted. An-
other employee was furious when he realized from a newspaper ac-
count how much the partners had been holding back. Cornering
David Modest, the employee fumed, \"Don't you tell us anything?\"
\225
Skadden started the negotiations Friday, three days before the dead-
line. Seventy lawyers from the various banks piled into Merrill's
boardroom. The lawyers discovered that the agreement they had
cometonegotiate actually didn't exist; too many issues divided them.
As the lawyers talked, the markets tumbled again, knocking Long-
Term's capital down to $400 million--9x percent below its level of
January L
Mead'snotes of the meeting show that the banks were highly con-

cerned that the partners' (and LTCM's)debts would capsize the
bailout: \"Long-Term needs cash of approximately $i\1772 million to
enable certain Principals to repay personal loans and to enable the
Management Company to repay, among other things, a $38 million
loan to Partnership.\" Also, Mead noted, the banks remainedex-
tremely nervous about investing. J. P. Morgan wanted a guarantee
that the banks could redeem their investment after three years. Chase
insisted that the $500 million revolver be repaid the day after the
closing. Bankers Trust and Deutsche Bank demanded seats on the
\"Oversight Committee\" that would run the fund. Morgan Stanley
and Goldman Sachs wanted joint indemnification if any one of the
banks were sued, and soon. This was a tall order by Monday.
What Mead's notes didn't say was that Mead was raising more is-
sues than all the other lawyers combined. The Goldman lawyer de-
manded that J.M. and his partners be stripped of day-to-day control;
that they lose their indemnity from investor lawsuits; that they be
stuck with full liability. Moreover, he insisted that the rescuers be
shielded from liability even for acts that the banks might commit in
the future. Sacking the ancien r\177gime was not enough; Mead wanted
to trundle out the guillotine.
By Friday evening, the cooler Milmoe, who had barely slept over
the pasttwo nights, had managed to piece together somebasicterms.
The consortium, to be dubbed \"Oversight Partner I,\" would invest its
money for three years. The partners' fees would be cut, a\177d half of
the management company would be transferred to the consortium
for a $\177fee.
Meriwether and his partners wo\177fld still run the fund day to day,
but they would report to the Oversight Committee, made up of
bankers who would work full-time in Greenwich and sever their ties
to their home banks. Ultimate authority would rest with a board of
directors from the banks.
The parmers got copies of the contract early Saturday. They im-
mediately exploded. It was indentured servitude, they hollered--it
denied them bonuses, incentives, liability protection, and freedom to
start anew. Accustomed to the extraordinary lives of the superrich,
the partners could not conceive of working for a salary, and one
merely $250,000 at that. They had lived in a bubble so long they had
forgotten the recent event--their own impending bankruptcy--fll.\177
had brought them to this pass. On Wednesday, J.M. h\177d

preciative\"; by Saturday, the gang was refusing to sign. There was
nothing in it for them.
This show of petulance carried a serious threat. The consortium
could not invest without the partners' signatures. And the consortium
\177vasnow publicly committed to doing the deal. By contrast, the part-
ners had little left to lose. They could always, they intimated, let the
fund blow up, seek cover in personal bankruptcy, and go get seven-
figure jobs on Walt Street. Rickardsmanagedtocool the partners off,
promising that the final version of the contract would be better. Then
a group of them left for Skadden, Arps.
Theprestigious Midtown law firm had set out two big conference
rooms and a series of private suites on the thirty-third floor to
accommodate an expected onslaught of lawyers and bankers. By
Saturday morning, \1774o lawyers were scurrying back and forth in
near pandemonium, trying to get a handle on the hedge fund's
numbingly complex assets, its debts, its structure, its management
company.
TheSkadden attorneys took questions from the bank lawyers in
the first conference room, a cavernous space with twenty-foot-high
ceilings that was quickly dubbed \"the lawyers' room.\" Milmoe, who
ran the meeting, said, \"Throw your issues at me,\" and the lawyers let
him have it.
Milmoe was in a terrible bind. Merrill--the consortium's de facto
leader--felt it had to close,a poor position from which to negotiate.
Trying to craft a contract that would beacceptable to fourteen banks
and each of the partners all within seventy-two hours, Mih\177oe natu-
rally had to fashion compromises. As the day wore on, the bank
laxvyers began to feel that Mih\177aoe was conceding too muchto Green-
with. At one point, striving for a consensus, the congenial attorney
said, \"I'd like to representLTCM's demands.\"
Mead snapped, \"How can the), have demands? They're going
bankrupt on Monday!\" Though the irritating Mead made Milmoe's
work more difficult, he worked to the consortium's advantage by
strengthe\177ing Milmoe's l\177egotiatmg hand.
Meriwcther, Haghani, Rosenfeld, l\177eahy, Shustak, and Rickards
showed up at Skadden at noon. The partners, who had to walk past
a gauntlet of incensed bankers in the hallway, were respectful and
coutrite, t\177urmuring expressions of gratitude, in a telling reversal, the
formerl,v nonchalant arbitrageurs had donned spiffy suits while the

bankers and lawyers were wearing chinos. The humbled partners
were escorted to the second conferenceroom--the due diligence
room--where the bankers peppered them with questions. It was
mostly fact-finding: the banks wouldn't commit until they under-
stood the fund better. The once-so-secretive partners were unusually
helpful, as if eager to dig up treasure they had long ago buried. They
left in late afternoon.
By now time was really running short, and most of the big issues
had yet to be resolved.Meadwas demanding that the Long-Term
partners personally guarantee their representations, and he wanted
the new money {the banks' money) shielded from lawsuits. Also,
Mead did not like the look of the parmcrs' intcrcompany loan; he
wanted them to repay it.
Thepartners had issues, too. They insisted that the little bit of old
money that remained should be available to satisfy lawsuits. They
didn't want the bankers monitoring them on the premises in Green-
wich. And the partners were balking at the bankers' demand that
each partner commit to staying for three years--upon pain of for-
felting his equity.
Also, the bankers would have to do something about LTCM, the
management company, which remained insolvent. Goldman, still
eager to stick it to the partners, suggested that LTCM simply be
folded. But LTCM also owed money to Chase--lots of money--so
Goldman's clever idea would leave Chase high and dry as well. Pflug
was furious at Goldman. \"We're out,\" Pflug said suddenly. Tom
Davis, the Merrill banker, hurriedly called Allison and told him the
dealwas falling apart. \177T5hings would soon get worse.
Sensing that there were too many issuesand not enough time,
Merrill made contingency plans. The bank signed default notices on
its repo contracts with Long-Term and rushed them to the Cayman
Islands,ready for quick delivery to Long-Term's local agent. Later in
the weekend, Merrill managers around the world werebriefed on the
procedures for liquidation. Their assumption was that if Long-Term
went under, other hedge funds would fail, too. What would happen
then Merrill could only guess, but it knew that in a panic, access to
funding disappears, and no brokerage can long survive without fund-
ing. Powerful as it was, Merrill was frightened.
Late Saturday, Joseph Flom, Skadden's name partner, called
moe to see how things were going. Flom was distressed by whal

heard. \"Thisis the first time that one casecould fuck up our relations
with three quarters of our clients,\" Flom noted. \"So don't screw it
The lawyers, including twenty-five assignedto the case by Skad-
den, gradually drifted to nearby hotels, leaving behind the half-eaten
sandwiches, paper cups, and stale coffee that ever adorn these legal
Woodstocks. Milmoe kept drafting. He penciled in revisions as a
dwindling band of lawyers stood at his shoulder, mumbling suggested
changes, and the printer hummed like a sleepless cat. Sometime after
4 A.XI., his mind still ringing with Flom's admonition not to let the
deal fall through, Milmoe tumbled onto the gray fabric couch in his
office and slept.
\225
Sunday morning, Allison hustled overto Skadden.He set up shop in
the smallroom between the two big conference rooms--this became
\"the bankers' room.\" By midmorning, bankers stood shoulder to
shoulder around the cluttered square tablewhere Allison was hoping
to save the rescue yet again.
The partners cameback,too. Meriwether and some of the others
were sitting together in one of the conferencerooms. But Hilibrand
was off to the side with his personal lawyer. Hilibrand, who was
hopelessly in debt, was wondering if he should quit the rescue, file for
bankruptcy, and put his debts behind him. Of course, that would take
the fund down, to(). AprSs moi...
Hilibrand's antics reminded the bankers of how little they wanted
to bethere. They were loath to help the partners personally. Only fear
kept them in the deal. Allison thought it would be worse for the
markets--much worse--if Long-Term failed now, after a deal had
beenannounced. Moreover, Merrill's reputation was on the line. And
Long-Term's lawyers knew how badly Allison wanted the deal; they
played the game of chicken masterfully. \"The consortium said, 'You
have no alternative but us,' \" recounted Bell, the Long-Term lawyer.
\"And we said, 'You have no alternative but us.' \" Though it is seldom
realized,acreditorisalso beholden to his debtor.
\225
For much of Sunday, the bankers--led by William Harrison, a vice
chairman of Chase, who had driven down from Connecticut with

Pflug--tried to line up necessarywaivers. The stickiest problems re-
lated to Nomura, RepublicBank, and the foreign exchange office of
Italy, each of which had loans to I,ong-Term. The bankers insisted
they wouldn't goahead until each of the three agreed to waive their
rights to immediate repayment.
Then there was Credit l,yonnais, which was calling its $50 million
loan to LTCM. Merrill's Richard Dunn called a senior executive of
the bank in Paris, where it was already nighttime Sunday, and made
an extraordinary plea for cooperation. Still no dice. The Western
world could hang, but the French wanted their money. Once again
Chase had to swallow its pride for the good of saving the manage-
ment company. LTCMdid have $1o4 million in deferred feescoming
its way, and Chase agreed that the money could be usedto pay off all
of LTCM's other debts, including Credit Ly(mnais and the intercom-
pa W debt. Chase would have to carry a $io8 million loan to the
worthless LTCM into the future.
This patently unselfish act might have saved the day, but Goldman
was not quite through. Early Sunday evening, Goldman dropped a
bomb. Robert Katz, Goldman's in-house counsel, announced that
Goldman would quit the consortium unless Chase agreed to waive its
right to repayment of the $5oo million bank syndicate. Goldman
couldn'tsee putting fresh money into the portfolio so that Chase
could take it out. The point \177vas to rescue l,ong-Term, not to rescue
Chase. This issue had been festering all weekend with many of the
bankers--who, typically, were happy to let Goldman play the heavy.
Once again, Pflug was dumbfounded--and tired of always being
the noble one. Even the other bankers, though sympathetic to (;old-
man's purpose, were stunned that it would risk the entire deal over
such a point.Russo, the Lehman lawyer, turned to Katz and said,
\"You're bluffing.\" Katz merely smiled. TheChase team made it clear
that they would walk. At that point, Katz reflected later, \"There was
no deal.\" It was 7 P.M.
Corzine, who was returning from a weekend at his majestic beach-
front home in the Hamptons, called the meeting room from his cell
phone. When Corzinereiterated that Goldman would not invest un
less Chase left its money in, Pflug, who had steadily been losingpa
tience,exploded. \"Jon,\" he said, \"there is no polite way to s;\177v
this--Goldman can go fuck themselves!\"Corzine, who was stu\177k m

ting heat from his bickering partners, who were backing away from
the consortium again.
After talking to Corzine, Katz said resignedly, \"We can't get an an-
swer tonight.\" So Goldman was out, too. KatzsaidGoldman'sexec-
utive committee would meet Monday morning at 6:30 and decide
then. Now it was the turn of Steve Black, the Salomon Smith Barney
executive, to erupt. All Goldman really wanted, he fumed,was twelve
hours' time to trade in Japan before it made up its mind. \"No way!\"
Ironically, the consortium's most intractable problems lay not with
Long-Term but among themselves. Frank Newman, chairman of
Bankers Trust, had abandoned the meeting, furious that Goldman,
Merrill, and Chase were excluding him from their various sidebar
chats. And the ugly issue of front-running, which had never gone
away, reared its head at the worst moment. Sandy Weill called Alli-
son; the Travelers chairman wasseethingover reports that Goldman's
traders were at it again. Allison pulled Katz asideand then spoke pri-
vately to Corzine on the telephone. Both of the Goldman executives
denied the reports. Allison told Katz, \"If one of us leaves, it all falls
apart. Do you really want the deal to fall apart over this?\"
Allison did not think Corzine was bluffing; Corzine's partners
were just obstinate enough to walk. But with two banks holding out,
Allison intuitively sensed the basis ofadeal: Goldman would reenter
the ring if only Chase would agree to its condition, Allison suggested.
One always had to indulge the bad boysat Goldman.Harrison and
Pflug saw no way out, and Chase consented; the fund could hang on
to the $500 million. Corzinepolled a few of his partners and
decided--perhaps too quickly--that he had their support. Around
9 P.M., Goldman rejoined the consortium.
The bankers still needed waivers from Chase's twenty-three syndi-
cate partners, in addition to Nomura, Republic, and the Italians.
Otherwise they wouldn't proceed. Also, the French bank Paribas, an
investor in the consortium, hadn't given a final assent. Allison went
around the room, polling the bankers to see who had contacts at
which banks. Then they began to call whatever time zonepeople
were awake in. Allison left a little before midnight.
In Greenwich, Rickards was frenetically negotiating by phone with
Skadden. At one point, Haghani darted out of the conference room
and blurted out, as if under a delusion, \"Remember one thing--we
gotta buy this baby back!\" Buy it back with what? Rickards may well

have wondered. Sometime after midnight, the attorney got the con-
sortium to agree to bonuses for the partners. At three, he left for
home. Despite all the loose ends, the lawyers expected to close the
dealat \177oA.M. Monday.
But Fleet, Republic,and Bank Nova Scotia had refused to sign the
waivers. William Rhodes, vice chairman of Citibank, who was
friendly with some of the holdouts, and Harrisonspent Monday
morning polling the banks. Harrison was vehement: they had to close
on Monday.
At Skadden, the bankers had staked out one conference room and
the partners were camped in the other, where a guard stood vigil at
the door. Allison shuttled between the two, periodically going off
with Meriwether to check on the status of his partners. Haghani
bumped into Black of Salomon Smith Barney in the hallway, and
said, \"I can't believe this has happened.\" Haghani felt their trades
would soar--and now it would all belong to the banks, not to the
partners.Black felt sorry for him. \177\"
Around eleven, J.M. sent an emissarytoconveyto Allison that the
partners wanted to apologize for the trouble they had caused and
wanted to help the consortium. But they were still divided. :\177A ma-
jority wanted to sign; they were drained and wanted the trauma over.
Hilibrand was holding out.
And the fund was losing money again. Thebankerskept watching
Bear, wondering if Long-Term would make it through Monday. Amid
this nerve-racking vigil, Goldman Sachs bowed to the inevitable and
canceled its planned public offering. This was doubly ominous for
Corzine, who had pledgedto invest $3oo million in Long-Term and
yet had failed to raise capital for his own firm.
Then Frank Newman, the chairman of Bankers Trust, who had
been pouting over his exclusion from the inner circle of bankers,
bolted. Incredibly, the insecure banker declared that he was quitting
the consortium. It was 3P.M.on Monday.
Allison now got on the horn with Newman. He was running out
of concessions but offeredonemore: a seat for Bankers Trust on the
Oversight Committee. Newman swallowed hard and rejoined the
deal.
At 5 P.M., the consortium agreed that the partners could call
\"old money\" to satisfy potential lawsuits. At 5:3 o, the consorlium
agreed that any partners who were fired wouldn't lose their t'qui\177

would those who quit. Meriwether, not quite satisfied, said, \"Our
guys still won't sign until it says we can goout and do a new fund.\"
That was their goal now--to get free of Long-Term.
Allison, who knew the banks would never invest $3.65 billion if
the partners were plotting to desert, pulled J.M. asideand explained
that he couldn't put it into writing. The partners would have to
committothreeyears each; markets would have little faith in the new
consortium unless it was seen as truly \"long term.\" But in time, Alli-
son ventured, the partners might be free to leave.J.M. heard this as
a promise; he had gotten all he could.
The waiverswere in, and the Federal Reserve had beenalerted to
keep its electronic payments wire open past its usual 6:30 closing
time. The Fed was expecting wires from fourteen banks totaling
$3.65 billion.
The partners were readyto sign. They stood in a knot at the far
end of the room, a cathedral-sized space that seemed to dwarf
the small band of diminished arbitrageurs. Hilibrand was reading
the contract, which was hopelessly illegible to all but the lawyers.
The margins were jammed with penciled revisions and crossed-out
sentences and arrows up and down, as though the contract were a vi-
sual representation of the confusion of the last three days. Rickards
and a couple of other attorneys were trying to tell Hilibrand what it
meant, but he didn't want to listen, he wanted to read it himself, and
he could barely see it through the tears that were streaming down his
face. He didn't want to sign, he wailed; there was nothing in it for
him, better to file for bankruptcy than lye someone else's indentured
servant with no hope of ever earning his way out. Meriwether took
Hilibrand aside and talked to him about the group, and how the oth-
ers were in it and needed him to be in it, and still, Hilibrand, who had
never needed anyone and who had once rebelled at paying for his
share of the company cafeteria but now couldn't pay his debts, re-
fused. Then Allison talked to him and said they were trying to restore
the public's faith in the system and not to destroy anybod B a\177d J.M.

Epilogue
The result was a downward spiral which fed upon itself driving market po-
sitions to unanticipated extremes well beyond the levels incorporated in
risk management and stressloss discipline.
--LTCM Confidential Memorandum, January \197799
Long-Term's debacle was a tragedy for its partners. Motivated by
insatiable greed, they had forcibly cashed out their outside investors
only months before, leaving themselves to withstand, virtually
alone, the brunt of the collapse. The wizards of Wall Street person-
ally lost $I.9billion. Larry Hilibrand, the most cocksure oftraders,
who had previously been worth close to half a billion dollars,
awoke to discover that he was broke. Forced to live off the assetsof
his wife, Deborah, he had to plead with Credit Lyonnais to spare
him the ignominy of personal bankruptcy while he tried to work off
a crushing $z4 million debt. Most ofthe other partnerslost9oper-
cent or more of their wealth--that is, everything they had invested
in the fund. Thanks to the smooth takeover encouraged by the Fed-
eral Reserve and managed by Herb Allison, most of the partners re-
mained far richer than ordinary Americans; high finance rewards
success, but in the twilight years of the twentieth century, it
strangely protected failure as well. The partners (including Hill-
brand) kept their elegant homes, even though their days among the
superrich were over. Never conspicuous spenders, they suffered
more for the way their epochal loss branded them as socially irre-

sponsible speculators in the public eye and for the way it ruined
their reputations among Wall Street colleagues. But no moral scan-
dal ensued. The money was lost, but honestly lost.
Eric Rosenfeld, Long-Term's manager, auctioned off caseloads of
the wine collection he had onceso lovingly assembled--some of it to
Merrill Lynch's Conrad Voldstad, who, as a member of the Oversight
Committee, had thus inherited Rosenfeld's portfolio as well. Worse
yet, Rosenfeld had to endure the knowledge that relatives of his wife,
who were by no meansrich,had sufferedlosses at his behest. But he
seemedtotakethesesetbacks in stride. When Bill Mclntosh, a former
colleague at Salomon Brothers, calledto see if there was anything he
coulddo, Rosenfeld responded wryly, \"Just send money.\"
Others of the partners became morose or desperate for vindica-
tion. Haghani, the master trader, was haunted by the fund's brief,
brutal devastation, so much of it caused by his repeated insistence on
betting the house. \"This is a personal tragedy,\" a friend of the mer-
curial Haghani noted. \"It's with him every day, and it's not going
away.\"
The fund's collapse got wide coverage around the country, virtu-
ally none of it sympathetic to the partners. Timedubbed them \"The
Brightest and the Brokest\" and noted that \"outrage was mingled with
shock.\" Headline writers had a field day with the failed geniuses.
\"We're So Rich, We Can Be Dumb,\" jeered the San Francisco Chron-
icle.Merton's hometown paper, The Boston Globe, chimed in with
\"Fast (and Suspect) Fix for a'Long-Term' Problem.\" The press natu-
rally seized on the bald unfairness of the Fed's helping to bail out
Wall Street moguls. In Philadelphia, the Inquirer pointedly de-
manded, \"When a Hedge Fund Fails, All Investors Suffer--Is That
Fair?\" while The Miami Herald's \"The Bolder They Are, the Softer
They Fall\" ripped the arbitrageurs as pampered rich kids.'
Merton was more distraught over the stain that Long-Term'sfail-
urecast on modern finance and on his own prodigious academic oeu-
vre.Though tacitly conceding that the models had failed, he insisted
that the solution was to design ever-moreelaborate and sophisticated
models. \17T7he notion that relying on any formulaic model posed in-
escapable riskseluded
him.
Merton's fellow laureate, Myron Scholes,was remarried, to a San
Francisco lawyer, at the elegant Pierre Hotel in New York, a week
after the bailout. Scholes could not escape signs of the catastrophe
even at his wedding. Meriwether and Rosenfeld kept darting off to

make telephone calls, and Merton Miller gave the groom a gentle
roasting, observing that Scholes had now found out for himself just
how dangerous it was to try to beat the market. \17A7t least the dashing
Scholes maintained his wit. Refusing to duck, the Nobel laureate
dryly informed the revelers that rather than his wife, Jan, taking his
name, hewould take hers.
As for J.M., he never spoke publicly about his feelings and didn't
speak much about the \"extreme event,\" as the fund referred to its col-
lapse. Eager to flee the limelight and horrified by the reporters who
banged at his door, 4the retiring trader reacted to his personal tragedy
like very few others in this overly public era: with utter silence. Surely,
as he had saidto Allison, he regretted it all. Perhapshebrooded over
how, after a lifetime of carefully playing the odds and avoiding the
limelight, he had become a notorious symbol of speculative excess.
But it would have been more like J.M. to banish the disaster from
mind. Long-Termhad beenabad trade; there would be others.
\225
The Federal Reserve reduced interest ratesonTuesday, September 29,
the very day after the bailout. However, the Fed's action did not bring
any relief to Long-Term or its new owners. In the wakeof the rescue,
U.S. swap spreads widened to 96\177/2 points and Britain's soared to
\17270. The spread on Royal Dutch/Shell--8 percent when Long-Term
had entered the trade--ballooned to 22 percent. The two classes of
Volkswagen shares--Long-Term had invested at a 40 percent differ-
ential--widened to more than 60 percent. And on it went.
Recapitalized with a fresh $3.65 billion, Long-Term continued to
plummet,likea parachutist who yanks the rip cord but keeps falling
anyway. In its first two weeks, the consortium lost $750 million. It
was happening again--for the consortium, the scariest of all possible
epilogues.
By mid-October, all of Wall Street seemedto have caught Long-
Term's disease. One by one, Merrill Lynch, Bankers Trust, UBS,
Credit Suisse First Boston, Goldman Sachs, and Salomon Smith
Barney--the linchpins of the new consortium--divulged largelosses
that in sum matched those of Greenwich. The banks' stocks plum-
meted, signaling a pervasive loss of confidence in the very institutions
that had come to Long-Term'srescue I. n the wake of the bailout, in-
vestors becameobsessed with Wall Street's careless sponsorship of
hedge funds. One after another, the banks dutifully reduced their ex-

posure to this noxious class--a category that so'recentlyhad been the
envy of all Wall Streetand now had becomea pariah.
In fact, the exposures, while big, were not as threatening as
alarmists maintained; there was no \"second Long-Term\" waiting in
the wings. But Long-Term (and other hedge funds) did have a corro-
siveeffect on Wall Street all the same.The banks had not been able
to resist the lure of the funds' fabulous--if fleeting--profits. Flush
with capital, they had rushed to set up their own, similar, trading
desks and had mimicked the hedge funds' diverse strategies. In the af-
termath of Long-Term'scollapse, the banks, too, had losses in bond
arbitrage, in Russia, and in equity derivatives. Familiarity had bred
the desire to imitate; that was the true price of the banks' \"expo-
sure.\"
Merrill Lynch's stock price plummeted by two thirds in a mere
threemonths--notas severe, and certainly not as enduring, as the 92
percent loss from top to bottom in Long-Term's equity, but astonish-
ing nonetheless. Komansky and Allison had taken such pride in
shielding Merrill from proprietary trading, but Merrill's bond traders
lost closeto a billion dollars all the same. Suddenly anxious that Mer-
rill's own credit rating would come under pressure,Merrill, led by Al-
lison, aggressively cut costs and fired 3,500people, largely in the
bond department. By mid-October, not only was Long-Termimplod-
ing again, but its new owners, the leading banks on Wall Street,were
in deepening trouble.
And now Alan Greenspan decided he had seenenough.OnOcto-
ber \1775, the Fed chief cut rates for a secondtime--a signal that he
would cut and keep cutting until liquidity to the systemwasrestored.
Wall Street rallied, and bond spreads narrowed. For the first time in
months, bond arbitrageurs made a sustained profit. In Greenwich,
the portfolio turned around. After six months that had been by turns
painful, then surprising, then agonizing, and then utterly devastating,
Long-TermCapital, which since April had lost the fabulous total of
$5 billion, finally stopped losing. The storm had passed.*
The fallout from the bust fell broadly but--as is usually the case--
unevenly on various of Long-Term's investors, employees, counter-
*In 2000, in an echo of the hedge fund's debacle, Soros and Tiger Manage-

parties, and Wall Street friends. Herb Allison, who had done more
than anyone to save the fund, was soon resented within Merrill Lynch
for his role in Merrill's zealouscost cutting. When the crisis passed
and memories of the panic faded, Allison was blamedfor overreact-
ing. Informed that he was not in line to succeed Komansky, Allison
resigned and went to work for Senator John McCain's presidential
campaign. Daniel Napoli, Merrill's risk manager, took the fall for
Merrill's losses. Replaced,he went on long-term leave.
Goldman's Jon Corzine continued his hot-and-cold romance with
Long-Term Capital for just a bit longer. Goldman let it be known
that--at the right price--Warren Buffett would still be an eagersuitor
for Long-Term. Corzine also called Prince Alwaleed to gauge the
Saudi's interest in joining yet another buyout bid. But by the end of
October, the fund had stabilized and the consortium had no need of
Goldman's
peripatetic bankers.
Goldman resurrected its IPO and went public in May \177999- But
Corzine, who had staked his career on the earlier IPO attempt and
had then staked it again on Meriwether, fell before the battle was
won. In January, in a rare boardroom coup, his partners sacked him.
Corzine made one final pass with Meriwether, the man he had
wanted as his partner for so long. In the spring, the two teamed up
to raise money to acquire Long-Term from its Wall Street owners,
with the idea that Corzine and Meriwether would run it together. But
the effort fizzled. Then Corzine, who had reaped $230 million in
Goldman's IPO, quit Wall Street and began a vigorous campaign for
the Democratic senatorial nomination in New Jersey. A bundle of
contradictions, Corzine was a decent man at the helm of a cutthroat
firm, a banker with a sense of his place in the larger world in a soci-
ety that honored only profits, and acompetitorwho fell on his sword
for Meriwether, a rival who disappointed him but enchanted him all
the same.
UBSwas left in tatters, devastated by losses not only from its in-
vestment in Long-Term but also from Rainy Goldstein's equity deriv-
atives unit. Mathis Cabiallavetta, the former prince of Swiss banking
and the architect of UBS'sdubious strategy, resigned. Marcel Ospel,
the chief executive formerly with the more prudent Swiss Bank,
quickly cleaned house. An unlucky victim was Andrew Siciliano, the
partners' friend and the manager at UBSwho had first expressed
doubts about the dubious Long-Termwarrant. For failing to take his
concerns to the very top, Siciliano was fired.

Bankers Trust suffered catastrophic losses in Russia, where it had
beenan aggressive buyer of ruble securities, as well as in Brazil and
other emerging markets. Apparently making a mockery of the self-
important pretensions of its chairman, Frank Newman, the bank was
forcedto sell out to a German rival, DeutscheBank.Though judged
a failure, Newman, who had nearly scotched the Long-Term rescue,
secured a golden parachute for himself estimated at $,oo million, in
the circumstances, an enormous undeserved bounty. \177
Sandy Weill came out on top, as he always seemed to. Citicorp and
Travelers/Salomonmergedonschedule. Lehman Brothers, which had
been plagued by rumors, quickly recovered. Chase Manhattan--
without whose repeated help Long-Term would have surely failed--
had its loans repaid and came out whole. Indeed, thanks to the
rescue, Long-Term met every margin call. All of its debts to creditors
were repaid in full.
\225
Most of Long-Term's outside investorscame out ahead--saved, iron-
ically, by the forced repatriation of their capital at the end of i997.
Some thirty-eight investors who had been lucky enough to invest at
the inception and to have been mostly cashed out in 1997 finished
with an average return of 18 percent a year--not quite as high as the
major stock averagesover the same span but very good all the same.
About an equal number ofinvestorswhohad fully cashed out before
the catastrophic losses of ,998 did even better.
Investorswho had been granted the special dispensation of being
allowed to keep more of their capital invested ultimately lost money.
Ironically, Bear's Jimmy Cayne, who nearly brought the fund down,
was one such \"favored\" loser. Komansky, chairman of Merrill, Who
invested at the top, was a loser,too. About a dozen big banks made
only single-digit annual returns, and a dozen others--including, no-
tably, UBS, Credit Suisse First Boston, and Dresdner--lost money.
The mixed results of the outside investors in no way diminished
the magnitude of Long-Term'sfailure. Even with the headwind of its
first four highly successful years, Long-Term's final, cumulative loss
was staggering. Through April ,998, the value ofadollar invested in
Long-Term quadrupled to $4.1I. By the time of the bailout, only five
months later, precisely 33cents of that total remained. After deduct-
ing the partners' fees, the results wereevensorrier: each invested dol-

lar, having grown to $:\177.85, shrank to a meager a3cents. In net terms,
the greatest fund ever--surely the one with the highest IQs--had lost
77 percent of its capital while the ordinary stock market investor had
been more than doubling his money.
\225
The fund's employees, likethoseatmost Wall Street firms, had gotten
mostof their pay in the form ofyear-end bonus money. Most of those
bonuseshad been invested in the fund and went down the drain. \"We
all lost our money,\" said a staffer who worked as an analyst. \"We
ended up working for nothing,\" said another, a bond trader.
In October, employees staged a minirevolt, demanding that future
bonus money be placed in a trust where it could not be squandered.
The staff also craved a measure of recognition, some admission that
their bosses had been wrong to keep them in the dark. But the part-
ners' habit of secrecy was deeply ingrained. At one meeting of part-
ners and staff, an employee demanded, \"Explain to us why we should
be sitting here and not looking for jobs.\"Replieda partner, \"That's
a valid question. We'll get back to you.\" The talented, dedicated
workersneverdid win their bosses' trust.
A month after the rescue, Long-Term laid off thirty-three employ-
ees, almost a fifth of the staff.\" After that, there was a steady stream
of defections. The fund offereda small severance package, but even
this was a carrot for which J.M. & Co. exacted a price. Departing
staff members were cajoled into signing termination agreements in
which they repeated a pledge never to say a word about the fund--
as if the partners feared the revelation of some secret shame.
\225
Once the fund stabilized, the partucrs found themselves in an un-
happy limbo. Though they still presided over a huge fund, their hands
were tied by their new Wall Street mastcrs, who monitored the fund's
every position like anxious schooln\177arms. Investing in new trades was
out of the question; the consortium's only interest was to get its
money back. The partners, who had fantasized that they might be
able to run the fund much as before, were bitterly disappointed. At
the consortium's directive, they steadily downsized, trimming posi-
tions and reducing exposures. Haghani took his sweet time in un-
loading trades; the Oversight Committee, which suspected Haghani

of foot-dragging, had to dispatch some of its members to London to
makesure the unyielding arbitrageur fell into line.
The partners' steely eleventh-hour negotiations had guaranteed
them a generous bonus--on average, $5oo,ooo--in return for stay-
ing the year. Otherwise, they were treated like the hired hands they
were, forced to swallow a bitter helping of their own gruel. Dis-
agreements between them and the bankswere resolved in favor of the
consortium, which now held all the power.The consortium, wanting
no more embarrassment from the free-swinging arbitrageurs, moni-
tored the fund's image, too. In a humiliating reversalofroles, they or-
dered the partners to clearpublic statements with their new bosses,
implying that now it was the partners that couldn't be trusted.
More distressing still, especially to a firm that had prided itself on
its clever avoidance oftaxes, the Internal Revenue Service launched a
global audit of LTCM and its various affiliates.The audit, which fo-
cuses on the years \177996 and \177997,and which remained unresolved
eighteen months after the fund's collapse, exposed the partners to the
possibility, one day down the road, of being billed for massive back
taxesowed.
After the crisis, the group's extraordinary unity broke down. Sev-
eral of the partners came to believe that for the good of the firm, Hill-
brand and Haghani should go, not only for their part in losing the
money but for their controlling dispositions, too. Neither was suited
to teamwork. Meriwether heard complaints about the two from
Hawkins, McEntee, Modest, and Mullins. But he was singularly un-
prepared to deal with them. J.M. held a few meetings and tried to
placate the mutineers, but he was too deliberate, and too loyal to his
longtime cohorts, to confront his two top traders. Hawkins finally
searched out the boss and declared, in effect, that it was either Hill-
brand or him. J.M., always spare with words, said, \"Good luck to
you.\" Then he left the room.
In the year following the bailout, unhappy partners gradually (and
with the consortium'spermission) left the firm. Most were abletotap
past connections and resume a normal working life.No stigma was
attached; second acts on Wall Street are as common as they are in
politics. Perhaps one cycle,be it an election cycle or an economic
cycle,is the extent of the public's memory.
Scholes, who was bitter about the entire experience, returned with
Jan to the Bay Area, where he took up writing and occasional lectur-

ing at Stanford. He and Chi-fu Huang, the former head of Long-
Term's Tokyo office, were hired to manage money for the Basses, the
Texastycoons. Merton continued to teach at Harvard. A year after the
rescue, with the benefit of his hard-won firsthand knowledge, Merton
was hired asa consultant in risk management by J. P. Morgan.
Modest, the intellectual modeler, became a managing director in
equities at Morgan Stanley. Mullins, the central banker, decided on
yet a third career change and became an adviserto several start-up
companies that provided financial services over the Internet.
Hawkins and McEntee drew up plans for an investment fund. With
the exception of the outspoken Scholes, who was never shy about of-
fering his thoughts--including on Long-Term,on which he had kept
detailed notes--the departed partners contentedly disappeared from
public view.
Meriwether never doubted that he and his core group from Sa-
lomon would try to raise moneyand do it again. Almost as soon as
the ink on the bailout agreementwas dry, J.M. and his loyalists began
to chafeunder the consortium's restrictions. They continually pestered
their overseers to let them raisenew money, and J.M. began to mutter
that Allison--who insisted that the group should wait a bit--wasn't
living up to his promise, as if the group's rescuer was in debt to them.
The partners went on the road in late \197798 and early \177999 to visit
their investors--ostensibly to explain the disaster but really to seed
the ground for future fund-raising. Allison was stunned to learn that
J.M. was circulating a brief on the disaster to investors in Europe--a
preludeto marketing his next venture--and the consortium ordered
him to stop.
\"Do these guys possibly think they can redeemthemselves?\"one
of the consortium bankers wondered. Clearly, they did. In their one
public interview before they were gagged, the partners put forth a re-
deeming and idealized view of themselves as a band of brilliant
ultrarationalists who, most unluckily, had been done in by an unrea-
soning and venal world.-
The partners appeared to accept responsibility; they said they did
and apologized on various occasions; but they never made clear just
what it was they wereapologizing for. J.M. & Co. generally denied
that either the leverage or the size of their portfolio had been a sig-
nificant contributing factor; they denied, even, that their basic strat-
egy had beenflawed. \17R7ather, in meeting after meeting,the partm'rs

blamed the irrationality and venality of other traders. They portrayed
Long-Termas the victim of outside events, specifically,of a liquidity
shortage in August followed by hostile front-running in September.
Onthe first anniversary of the historic meetingat the Fed, Myron
Scholes cogently argued in a talk at New York's Windows on the
World restaurant that spreads on lower-rated bonds had widenedto
greater levels than could have been explained by mere default risk.
Therefore, Scholesconcluded, the spreads must have been \"liquid-
ity spreads,\" representing the premium that investors were willing
to pay for more liquid paper. There is a circular nature to such ar-
guments: when prices fall, one may always blame the absence of
buyers and hence of \"liquidity.\" As Scholes himself pointed out,
there were very real, underlying events that had scared the buyers
away; to wit, investorshadbeen counting on the IMF to bail out de-
veloping regions, but the IMF had been incapable of protecting
everyone at once:
The example I like to give is that of a father with several sons.
Each son thinks that the father will support him in his time of
need. But, if one of his brothers needssupport, the father then
has fewer resources to support his activities and also those of his
other brothers. The value of the support option is diminished in
value. This, in part, is the cause of the flight to liquidity in Au-
gust. Figuratively, another son, Russia, could not be sufficiently
supported, and as a result, all of the other sons, the underdevel-
opedcountries,lookedless
credit worthy. \177
Scholes lamented that academics and practitioners hadn't modeled
this \"stress-loss liquidity component\" and its implications for prices.
But obviously, illiquidity was merely the expression of the problem,
not its cause. What was missing from theseself-serving sound bites
was any suggestion that Long-Term had been at fault for exposing it-
self to such perils. A man driving a car at thirty miles an hour may
blame the road if he skids on a patch ofice; a man driving at a hun-
dred miles an hour may not.
Scholesaverted the question of why \"academics and practitioners\"
had ignored the long-established and basically self-evident liquidity
risks. Even after their historic loss, the Long-Term partners admitted
no essentialmistake.Theyhad beendone in, they argued, by an un-
foreseeable event--a perfect storm such as strikes once in a hundred

years. \"I believe that,\" Rosenfeld explained after the crash. \"I do
think it was something that never happened before.\" \"' Of course, it
had happened, not once in a hundred years but many times--in Mex-
ico, on Wall Street, in stocks, in bonds, in silver, in Thailand, in Rus-
sia, in Brazil. People caught in such financial cataclysms typically feel
singularly unlucky, but financial history is replete with examples of
\"fat tails\"--unusual and extremeprice swings that, based on a read-
ing of previous prices, would haveseemed implausible.
Whatever they had learned from the trauma, the partners contin-
ued to insist, just as they had before the bailout, that spreads were
too wide, that now was the time to invest, that opportunities had
never looked better. The models said so! On this they were proven
wrong--or at least,a year after the bailout, they had yet to be proven
right. Though Wall Streetrecovered, Long-Term's brand of arbitrage
did not. Under its new owners, the fund enjoyed agood last quarter
in I998 and agood start to the new year; then it went into a tailspin.
In the summer of \177999, U.S. swap spreads once again ballooned, to
\17\71727 points--wider, even, than at the astronomical height of the pre-
vious year's panic. The once-in-a-century flood had struck twice in
two years.
On September28, 1999, exactly a year after the bailout, swap
spreads remained at 93 points and equity volatility was at 30 per-
cent--each far higher than when Long-Term had entered the respec-
tive trade. In the first year after the bailout, the fund earned \177o
percent--hardly a dramatic recovery. Then, in addition to this mod-
est profit, the fund redeemed the consortium's $3.65 billion in capi-
tal. For practical purposes, the fund had liquidated by early 2ooo.
So Long-Term's problem had not been just illiquidity. Perhaps the
fund's entire strategy had been wrong, and the world's (and Long-
Term's) perception of credit in I998 had been a little too rosy. The
evidence suggests that both factors were at work: Long-Term mis-
judged the markets, and the effect of that misjudgment was sorely
compounded in September, when--to protect themselves against
Long-Term's imminent collapse--other traders went on strike and
\"liquidity\" disappeared.

increased the odds ofa future disaster. \"To be sure, somemoral haz-
ard, however slight, may have been created by the Federal Reserve's
involvement, ''\177the Fed chief declared. However,hejudged that such
negatives were outweighed by the risk of \"serious distortions to mar-
ket prices had Long-Term been pushed suddenly into bankruptcy.\"
If one looks at the Long-Term episode in isolation, one would tend
to agree that the Fed was right to intervene, just as, if confronted with
a suddenly mentally unstable patient, most doctors would willingly
prescribe a tranquilizer. The risks of a breakdown are immediate;
those of addiction are long term. But the Long-Term Capital case
must be seen for what it is: not an isolatedinstance but the latest in
a series in which an agency of the government (or the IMF) has come
to the rescue of private speculators. In one decade, this unfortunate
roster has grown to include the savings and loans, big commercial
banks that had overlent to realestate, investors in Mexico, Thailand,
South Korea, and Russia(wherea bailout was attempted), and now
the various parties affiliated with Long-Term Capital. It is true that
the Fed's involvement was limited and that no government money
was used. But the banks would not have come together without the
enormous power and influence of the Fed behind them, and without
a joint effort, Long-Term surely would have collapsed. Presumably,
the banks and others would have suffered more severe losses--
though not, one thinks, as great as some suggested.LongoTerm'esx-
posure was huge, but, spread over all of Wall Street, it was hardly
of apocalyptic proportions. At some point the selling would have
stopped. At some point buyers would have returned and markets
would have stabilized. Other banks could have failed, though that
was an outside chance at best.
Permitting such losses to occur is what deters most other people
and institutions from taking imprudent risks. Now especially, after a
decade of prosperity and buoyant financial markets, a reminder that
foolishnesscarries a price would be no bad thing. Will investors in
the next problem-child-to-be, having been lulled by the soft landing
engineered for Long-Term, be counting on the Fed, too? On balance,
the Fed's decision to get involved--though understandable given the
panicky conditions of September \177998--regrettably squandered a
choice opportunity to send the markets a needed dose ofdiscipline.
McDonough always defended his actions, though he seemed dis-
pleased and perhapsembarrassed by the fund's survival. A year after

Greenspan's more serious and longer-running error has been to
consistently shrug off the need for regulation and better disclosure
with regard to derivative products. Deludedas to the banks' ability
to policethemselves before the crisis, Greenspan called for a lessbur-
densome regulatory regime barely six months after it. '\17H7is Neolithic
opposition to enhanced disclosure--which,because it allows in-
vestors to be their own watchdogs, is ever the best friend of free cap-
ital markets--served to remind one of the early Greenspan who (in
thrall to Ayn Rand) once wrote, \"The basisof regulation is armed
force. '''4 In fact, it is in countries that lack transparency (suchas Rus-
sia) that markets need to bedefended by soldiers.
If the Long-Term episodeproved anything, it is that the systemof
disclosure that has worked so well with regard to traditional securi-
ties has not been able to do the job with respect to derivative con-
tracts. To put it plainly, investors have a pretty good idea about
balance-sheet risks; they are completely befuddled with regard to de-
rivative risks. Some of the reporting standards are being changed
(over the opposition of both Greenspan and the banks), but gaping
holes remain. As the use of derivatives grows, this deficiency will re-
turn to haunt us.
Moreover, aside from improving reporting on derivatives, there is
a strong argument to be made for restricting actual exposure. Regu-
lators limit the amount that Chase Manhattan and Citibank can lend,
so that their loans do not exceedacertain ratio of capital. The regu-
lators do this for good reason: banks haverepeatedly shown that they
will exceed the limits of prudence if they can. Why, then, does
Greenspanendorse a system in which banks canrack up any amount
of exposure that they choose--as long as that exposure is in the form

TheFed's two-headed policy--head in the sand beforeacrisis, in-
tervention after the fact--is more misguided when viewed as one
single policy. The government's emphasis should always be on pre-
vention, not on active intervention. It is altogether proper that the
government set rules in advance for regulated bodies such as banks;
crisis intervention on behalf of unregulated hedge funds is another
matter.

232 \225EPILOGUE
The White House formed a blue-ribbon panel, the President's
Working Group on Financial Markets, a multiagency group (includ-
ing the Fed) to study the Long-Term debacle. Its report concluded,
\"The central public policy issue raised by the LTCM episode is how
to constrain excessiveleverage more effectively.\" Moreover, it recog-
nized the growing role of derivatives, noting, \"Balance-sheet leverage
by itself is not an adequate measure of risk. '''\177However, the report
was weaker when it came to proposing solutions. It did call for en-
hanceddisclosure by hedge funds, better risk and credit management
policies by banks, and tougher regulatory standards. But the cau-
tiously worded report, which was issued in April i999, did not have
the fire to provoke action from Congress, which in any case was
rapidly losing interest in Long-Term. \"Last September and October,
it was a hot issue,\" David Runkel, a spokesman for the House Bank-
ing Committee, noted the summer after the crisis. \"But not now.\"'6
The furor overhedge funds also died down--and appropriately so.
The Long-Term crisis happened to involve a hedge fund, but the fa-
thers of the crisis were the big Wall Street banks, which let their stan-
dards grow lax as their pocketbooks grew flush. At the time of the
bailout, the banks were depicted as victims that had been kept in the
dark by Long-Term's patented secrecy. Such a view was enhanced by
various bankers' assertions of innocence. (Komansky, for one, called
a friend upon leaving the Federal Reserve and declared, \"When I saw
their position, my fucking knees were shaking.\") With time, such
claims rang increasingly hollow. Each bank had known its own ex-
posure to Long-Termtrade by trade; it did not take geniusfor them
to infer that the fund was doing similar business elsewhere,
Patrick Parkinson, aFedofficialassigned to the President's Work-
ing Group, told aSenate committee a couple of months after the res-
cue:
LTCM appears to have received very generous credit terms,
....
even though it took an exceptional degreeofrisk Counter-
parties obtained information from LTCM that indicated that it
had securitiesand derivatives positions that were very large rel-
ative to its capital. However, few, if any, seem to have really un-
derstood LTCM's risk profile.\"
So the question becomes, why did the bankers lend? In a public
symposiumearly in r999, Walter Weiner, the former chairman of Re-

public, maintained that the banks had had no choice--or at least,no
choice other than the rare, courageous one of rejecting business: \"To
enter the club, you had to play by LTCM's rules. The terms were non-
negotiable--take it or leave it.\" \177The banks took it. They, too, were
greedy, and they were awed by Long-Term's performance and dazzled
by the partners' reputations, degrees, and celebrity. \"We may have
been mesmerized by these supermen,\" Weiner acknowledged. Unique
in Wall Street history, the fund had blazed across the financial skies
like a luminous rocket, a half-man, half-machine that seemingly re-
ducedan uncertain world to rigorous, cold-blooded odds. Like visi-
tors from a remote future, the professors seemed to have superseded
the random luck and ill fate that had ever lurked in the shadows of
markets.

Long-Term's saga of riches to rags was replete with lessons for in-
vestors. Its astonishing profits looked less impressive in the light of
the losses that followed. As with an insurer who collects heady pre-
miums but gives them back when a big storm hits, Long-Term's prof-
its were not, in a sense, all \"earned\"; in part, they were borrowed
against the day when the cyclewould turn. No investment--Inrernet
wunderkinds included--can be judged on the basis of half a cycle
alone.
Indeed, Long-Term saw that the cycle was turning but inexplicably
refused to prune its exposures. As spreads narrowed, inevitably rais-
ing the risks in the business, Long-Term increased its leverage, as if
borrowing could turn an unattractive business into abetterone rather
than just a riskier one. Long-Term wouldn't have made this mistake
but for a major managerial weakness: the absence of any independent
checkon the traders. In the end, every partner had sat through the
risk-management meetings, and everyone, ultimately, had acquiesced
in the trades. In that sense, every partner was to blame.
Long-Term put supreme trust in diversification--one of the shib-
boleths of modern investing, but an overrated one. As Keynes noted,
one bet soundly considered is preferable to many poorly understood.
The Long-Term episode proved that eggs in separate baskets can
break simultaneously. Moreover, Long-Term fooled itself into think-
ing it had diversified in substance when, in fact, it had done so only
in form. Basically,the fund made the same bet on lower-rated bonds

==================================================

in every imaginable permutation. It is hardly a surprise that when the
cycle turned and credit tightened--as, throughout recorded time, it
periodically has--Long-Term's trades fell in lockstep.
It is interesting to compare Long-Term's losses from various cate-
gories of trades from January \177,t998, to the bailout: \177
Russia and other emerging markets: $43 \260million
Directional trades in developed countries (such as shorting
Japanese bonds): $37\177 million
Equity pairs (such as Volkswagen and Shell): $z86 million
Yield-curvearbitrage:
$z\1775 million
Standard & Poor's 500stocks: $zo3 million
High-yield (junk bond) arbitrage: $\177oo million
Merger arbitrage: Roughly even
These seven categories accounted for $\177.6 billion in losses--a cat-
astrophic result.However, Long-Term could have survived them.
Now consider the losses in its two biggest trades:
Swaps:
$\177.6 billion
Equity volatility: $i. 3 billion
It was these two trades that broke the firm. Long-Term got far too
big in these markets--a cautionary error. It got so big that it distorted
the very markets on whose efficiency the firm relied. This wouldn't
have mattered but for the fact that Long-Termalso leveraged its cap-
ital 3 \260to \177--again, in addition to the huge leverage implicit in its de-
rivatives book. One can he big (and therefore illiquid); one can
(within prudent limits) be leveraged. But the investor who is highly
leveraged and illiquid is playing Russian roulette, for he must be right
about the market not merelyat the end, but every single day. (One
wrong day, and he isout ofbusiness.) Long-Term was so self-certain
asto believe that the markets would never--not evenfora wild swing
some August and September--stray so far from its predictions.
Reared on Merton's and Scholes's teachings of efficient markets,
the professors actually believed that prices would go and go directly
where the models said they should. The professors' conceit was to
think that models could forecast the limits of behavior. In fact, the
models could tell them what was reasonable or what waspredictable
based on the past. The professors overlooked the fact that people,
traders included,are not always reasonable. This isthe true lesson of
Long-Term's demise. No matter what the models say, traders are not

machines guided by silicon chips; they are impressionable and imita-
tive; they run in flocks and retreat in hordes.
Even when traders get things \"right,\" markets can hardly be ex-
pected to oscillate with the precision ofsinewaves.Prices and spreads
vary with the uncertain progress of companies, governments, and
evencivilizations. They are no more certain than the societies whose
economic activity they reflect. Dice are predictabledown to the dec-
imal point; Russia is not; how traders will respond to Russia is less
predictablestill. Unlike dice, markets are subject not merelyto risk,
an arithmetic concept, but alsoto the broader uncertainty that shad-
ows the future generally. Unfortunately, uncertainty, as opposed to
risk, is an indefinite condition, one that does not conform to numer-
ical
straitiackets.
The professors blurred this crucial distinction; they sent their
mathematical Frankenstein gamely into the world as if it could tame
the elementof chance in life itself. No self-doubttempered them; no
sense of perspective checked them as they wagered such staggering
sums.
The supreme irony is that the professorswere trying to deconstruct
and ultimately to minimizerisk, not--theybelieved--to speculate on
overcoming it. In this, the fund was not unique. Long-Termwas in
fact the quintessential fund of the late twentieth century--an ex-
periment in harnessing the markets to the twin new disciplines of
financial economics and computer programming. The belief that to-
morrow's risks can be inferred from yesterday's prices and volatilities
prevails at virtually every investment bank and trading desk. This
was Long-Term's basicmistake, and its stunning losses betrayed the
flaw at the very heart--the very brain--of modern finance.
None other than Merrill Lynch observed in its annual report for
\177998, \"Merrill Lynch uses mathematical risk models to help estimate
its exposure to market risk.\" In a phrase that suggested some slight
dawning awareness of the dangers in such models, the bank added
that they \"may provide a greater sense of security than warranted;
therefore, relianceonthesemodels should be limited. ''\177''I'f Wall Street
isto learn iust one lesson from the Long-Termdebacle, it should be
that. The next time a Merton proposes an elegant model to manage
risks and foretell odds, the next timea computer with a perfect mem-
ory of the past issaidto quantify risks in the future, investors should
run--and quickly--the
other way.
On Wall Street, though, few lessons remain learned. In N\177,vcml,t'r

I999, JWM Partners--the principals were Meriwether, Haghani,
Hilibrand, Leahy, Rosenfeld, and Arjun Krishnamachar--circulated
an offering document for \"Relative Value Opportunity Fund II.\" Ac-
cording to the circular, leverage in their new fund would beheldto a

would make use of a \"risk control system\" that had been designed
\"to help ensure to the extent practicable that the Portfolio Company
can withstand extreme events of the type experienced in \177998. ''
Whether any mathematical systemdesigned with a previous crisis in
mind can ensure against future debacles is doubtful, but for Meri-
wether, the successful launch of JWM was yet another astonishing
comeback, the sort for which Wall Street is justly famous. In Decem-
ber, fifteen months after he lost $4.5 billion in an epic bust that
seemedabout to take down all of Wall Street and more with him,
Meriwether raised$250 million, much of it from former investors in
the ill-fated Long-Term Capital, and hewasoffand running again.
