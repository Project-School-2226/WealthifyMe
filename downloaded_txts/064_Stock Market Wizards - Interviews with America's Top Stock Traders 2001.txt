She couldn't have been nicer. "Our planes leave as soon as everyone is
here. Since we hadn't heard from you to tell us you were running late, we
assumed you weren't coming. If you had called, we would have held the
plane." And, you know, they would have, too; that's how Martha's Vine-

explanation?

"Okay, okay," you're saying, "a slightly amusing anecdote—maybe—
but what does this have to do with trading or investing?" Simply this: If
you're too busy picking the lint off your jacket, you're liable to miss the
plane. In other words, don't get so caught up in the details that you miss
the big picture. Here are some examples of market myopia:

Stuart Walton's career as a trader is marked by a string of contradic-

narrowly missing the feat of having lived in three separate centuries.
In 1892, Walton at the age of twenty-three, Reindeer lelt England to
work as a missionary in northern Canada. He typically traveled over
two thousand miles a year by canoe and dogsled, visiting his far-flung
constituency—the Indians and Eskimos that lived around the Arctic
Circle.
One year, vast forest fires swept through northern Quebec,
and leaving me, ga and vegetation all the region's most destroying al

Your interests seem to be so strongly artistic. Why did you go for
an M.B.A.?
Because the journalism idea fell through as well, and I decided I
needed to earn a living.
What went wrong with journalism?
I applied to several journalism schools. That summer, while visiting

No, I would have to take a film course just to learn how to point the

life, and for me this business is the best way to acquire them.

BACK FROM THE ABYSS
They sent me to a training program in New York. I spent most of the
training program in the foreign exchange trading room, which was a
fluke because I was supposed to be trained as a loan officer and sent
back to Canada.

happens to all the learning and academics I've done? Does it all just
get shoved away for the rest of my life?"
The job in the foreign exchange department didn't help matters at
all. If anything, it turned me off to trading because of all the day-to-
day friction. The job was my first introduction to Americans; I had
been surrounded by Canadians all my life. Canadians are more laid-
back; they are more concerned about etiquette than going for the
jugular or getting their point across. There were traders on the desk
who would just scream at me all the time. Most times, I didn't even
know why. Maybe it was because they needed someone to take it out
on when their positions went bad, or maybe it was because I didn't do
things quickly enough for them. I would go home every night upset
because someone had shouted at me.

At the time, Wood Gundy was trying to become a major dealer in
the U.S. bond market, and they had brought in a bunch of hired-gun
traders. These guys were just blowing up left, right, and center. There
were huge losses everywhere. One trader even hid his tickets to con-

I had mixed feelings. I was certainly happy to get away from the ver-
bal abuse. Also, the bond desk was very exciting because it traded
huge position sizes compared with the equity desk. I liked the idea
that I could make or lose five times as much as twenty people com-
bined on the equity desk. But I didn't like being responsible for
trading all sorts of illiquid issues, most of which were overseas
bonds.

On what basis were you making buy and sell decisions?
I didn't have any methodology. I almost got to the point where I

By that point, had you developed a passion for trading?
Yes, I knew it was something I loved to do. I liked the idea that it was
me against the markets. I just didn't care for the markets I was trad-

trading in New York were highly illiquid. I decided to transfer to the

When you were cold-calling, I guess a lot of people just hung up

Absolutely. I used to do waves of calls. I had a list of people to call,
and I just put my head down and started dialing. I don't have an
aggressive nature, so I tried drawing people in by just being a nice guy.
That didn't work too well. It was a relentless day-after-day process. It
was difficult watching other people doing business while I was mak-
ing these phone calls, knowing that it was obvious to them whenever
someone hung up on me. I would have a five-second conversation,
put the phone down, and look around. Then I would

wasn't the low point [he No, this laughs]. The low point happened
shortly afterward. Regardless of my lack of success in selling, I knew
there was a big difference between trading and selling. Eventually,
after watching the markets, I decided I had to start trading again.
Although I didn't have any money, I realized that I could take out a
home-equity loan and do whatever I wanted with the money. I said to
myself, "I can liquefy my house and invest it."
I can see it coming . . .

thought were down too low. In effect, I was shorting good companies
and buying bad companies.

I had placed a down payment of $75,000 on the house, and I took out
a loan of $50,000 against it. Within three weeks of taking out the
loan, I had lost 75 percent of the money.

I did tell her that I was going to invest it, but I told her that I was
going to invest it in a conservative dividend play that would give us a
greater return than the rate we had to pay on the home-equity loan.
That was my intention. But once I had the money I thought, "I'm not

STUART WALTOfl RACK FROM T:
What kind of response are you looking for?
I want to see a stock move higher on good news, such as a favorable
earnings report or the announcement of a new product, and not give
much ground on negative news. If the stock responds poorly to nega-
tive news then it hasn't been blessed.
That's 75 percent. What's left?
The last 25 percent is my gut feeling for the direction of the market as

Yes.

I often end up missing the rest of the move because the stocks I am

Because the price/earnings ratio was greater than fifteen?
Right.
Do you feel it is a flawed investment policy to try to buy stocks
that have low price/earnings ratios?
Not necessarily. I would never adopt that type of strategy myself, but
I feel that any sound strategy will work as long as you stick to it.
Were there any restrictions on the stocks you bought for your
own account?
I was allowed to buy any stocks I wanted to, as long as they were not
the same names I was buying for the company's clients.
What was the difference in performance between your own
account and the accounts you were managing for the com-
pany?
For the company accounts, I would only be up an average of 1 5 to 20
percent per year, while on my own account, I was averaging well over
100 percent per year.
Did you try going to management and saying, "Look, here's what

Sure, but they had geared the firm to follow their particular philoso-

investor wants to see is a change in strategy.
My idea, however, was to try to adapt to any new strategies that

How did you get investors?
Strictly word of mouth. I didn't do any marketing.
I see that you're here completely on your own, which is amaz-
ing for a hedge fund managing $150 million. Don't you have
any help?
I have a secretary who comes in every other day.

That would just kill everything. The only way I can possibly maintain
my track record is to make sure I don't overwhelm myself with
assets. Right now, if I have a good quarter, it ramps up the amount of
money I am managing. By growing through capital appreciation, I
can evolve my trading style to accommodate the increase in assets

ruptcy helped you become successful?
Definitely.
? y a w t a h w n I
The odd thing about this industry is that no matter how successful
you become, if you let your ego get involved, then one bad phone call
can put you out of business. My having seen the abyss might spare
me from malting that phone call. I know how quickly things can go
bad. Any stock can go to zero, and you need to realize that.
When I talk to potential new investors I focus on my mistakes.
Because if you are going to invest with someone, you want that per-
son to have made mistakes on his own tab and not to make them on
yours. Someone who has never made a mistake is dangerous, because
mistakes will happen. If you've made mistakes, you realize they can
recur, and it makes you more careful.
We've talked about the mistakes you've made early in your
career. What mistakes have you made during your more recent
successful years?
my waiting for prices to confirm without This year I got very bearish
opinion.
What made you so blindly bearish?
I became very concerned about the rise in interest rates. In the past,
higher interest rates had always led to lower stock prices, and I
assumed the same pattern would repeat this year. The market, how-

own fault for allowing myself to be susceptible to these stories. I think
I've learned not to trade on those types of stories anymore. The good
news is that I quickly switched back to buying the types of companies
that I like. By the end of the quarter, I had recovered all my losses.

Absolutely. In fact, many analysts blow out when they become fund
managers because they do not have the conviction level that is essen-
tial to put on a big position. I tell my guys that if we come up with a

own holdings.
Also, one of my objectives is to be able to make money in any mar-

from the market indexes. Limiting myself to a relatively small number
of positions is essential to achieving this goal.
Finally, from a purely practical perspective, it is much easier to

though, that to achieve our twin goals of exceptional performance
and low correlation with the broader market, we don't want to diver-
sify too much.
Is this a fixed number?
At any given time, our holdings will exceed fifteen stocks because of
the frequent rotation of our portfolio—the

because of their low turnover of stock holdings, index funds also offer
the benefits of lower management fees and more favorable tax treat-
ment. Frankly, there is nothing wrong with this argument. Indexation,
presumably lower risk due to the index's diversification. In addition,
as it was intended, is a reasonable investment strategy.
As index funds outperformed the majority of other funds at lower
vest- n of i on orti p ng di n pa x e dily stea a attracted hey wever, t ho osts, c
ment flows. This shift, in turn, created more buying for the stocks in
the index at the expense of much of the rest of the market, which
helped the index funds outperform the vast majority of individual
stocks, and so on. As a result, what started out as a strategy for
investors to link their fortunes to the market via an index has been
turned on its head, with the index responding to the ever-increasing
share of index-linked investment capital.
How do funds such as Fidelity Magellan fit into this picture?
The managers of these funds are not being evaluated based on their
absolute performance, but rather on how their performance compares
with the benchmark—the S&P 500. Thus, their goal has become to
beat the benchmark and is not necessarily linked to their clients' para-
mount objective: making money.
As a consequence, to advance and preserve their careers, the pro-
fessional managers have shaped their portfolios to essentially overlap
the S&P 500 index. To the extent that they slightly modify the portfolio,
there has been a strong bias toward a greater concentration in the high-

Microsoft is arguably one of the great success stories of the century
and a terrific company. However, at a market capitalization in excess
of $600 billion, it is valued at over twenty times its annual revenues—
that's revenues, not earnings. To put it in a different perspective, the
market is valuing Microsoft higher than the total GDP for Canada, a
G7 member. And this for a company whose growth rates have been
diminishing and whose primary product line—computer operating
systems—is threatened with obsolescence by alternative solutions. In
addition to the Justice Department, nearly the entire technology
mine industry is trying to under Microsoft—a

one recent holding, Tektronix, had revenues of about $2 billion and a

I remember when I was working as a junior analyst, Prime Com-

institutional salesman asked my "mentor": "With the stock having
gone from $4 to $40, what do you see that the rest of the world
doesn't? Obviously some of the good fortunes that you're talking
about are already reflected in the valuation." His rejoinder was that he

What are you looking for in these numbers?
I'm looking for someone with a huge share position that is beginning

That is an understatement. Dell recently was selling for a market cap-
italization greater than the entire sales of the PC market. Now it's
down 30 percent from that point, and I submit it will go even lower,
because PCs are the quintessential commodity, with supply being
unlimited and demand finite.
What drove the stock so high?
The indexation phenomenon we spoke about and the generally self-
reinforcing feedback cycle, wherein people buy a stock precisely
because it is going up. If you look at the stock, it's a crowded trade.

The second thing we look for is a market-adjusted decline of at
l
50 percent, then the stock being down 50 percent doesn't mean any-
thing. If the market is down 10 percent, 1 want to see the stock down
60 percent.
I find that interesting, because I know that statistical studies
show that buying stocks that demonstrate relative strength—that
market is, that are stronger than the average—tend
market. Yet you are only buying stocks that are
to do better
than the general
relatively weak.
Relative weakness is a gradual Chinese torture-type of decline. I'm
not talking about relative weakness; I'm talking about a catastrophic
plunge. To use the example of one of our recent holdings, Tektronix,
when a stock goes from nearly $50 to $15 at the same time the mar-
ket has been moving sharply higher, you have a debacle, not relative
weakness.

Okay, continue with your list of stock selection factors.
The fifth screen is value. The value has to be extremely compelling.
How do you measure value?
We use some conventional measures, such as price to sales, cash flow,
book value, but not necessarily price to earnings because, as I pointed
out before, the company could actually be losing money on a reported
basis. The most important measure of value, however, which I admit
is somewhat subjective, is price to intrinsic, or private market, value.
What do you mean by private market value?

Can you provide an example of an actual stock you bought based
on this selection process?
Let's stay with Tektronix, which we bought in late 1998. It met each

Fifth, the value was compelling. As I mentioned earlier, the total
capitalization of the company was equal to less than 25 percent of its
annual revenues. It was also selling at a discount to its book value and
at a fraction of its private market value.
Sixth, there was an identifiable catalyst that could be timed. The

based on its remaining healthy printer and instrumentation divisions,

Yes, it comes back to the notion that we restrict ourselves to fifteen
stocks. If we have a position in the portfolio, it means that it still has
to be more attractive on a risk-reward basis than any other opportu-
nity we could find as a replacement.
The methodology you described obviously only applies to stocks
you buy. What is the difference between the way you approach
short positions versus long positions?

It's much more than that. There is an inherent conflict between you
and your client. Your client wants to make money, and you want to
generate maximum commissions; that is the sell-side [brokerage firm]
analyst's number one priority. Hence there is a bias for recommenda-
tions that are easily saleable by the sales force—stocks that enjoy pos-
itive market perceptions and are ultraliquid so that firms can transact
a maximum number of shares. Any exceptional money-making poten-
tial of the idea, or risk to capital if market perceptions turn negative,
is strictly an afterthought. Recommending stocks that are deemed as

Your company literature states that you have a policy of not dis-
closing your positions. Why?
There are three reasons. The first applies only to shorting stocks. If a
CEO sees that you are shorting his stock, he will likely never again be
easily accessible. I remember in the days when I was an analyst, there
were several occasions when I wrote what could be termed as bearish

going short. After that report, the management suddenly became
much less accessible. The same thing happened to me as a fund man-
ager when I listed my short positions—the access to these companies
would be permanently compromised. And, remember, frequent con-
tact with companies' executives^ an essential part of what we do.
Second, when I disclose my positions, there is a lot of coattailing.

And, the third reason for not disclosing your positions?
I think of myself as a reasonably courteous person. If an investor
called and asked me why I owned a certain stock, I would probably

terintuitive to many. My research involves not only knowing the
fundamentals intricately, but also being aware of the investment com-
munity's perception of the company. If a stock has just gotten
slammed from $50 to $15, and the major funds have just finished
dumping their last shares of the company, I submit that they may
have created a terrific pricing inefficiency.

there have been some negative commentaries and analyst recommen-

$15 and why it is probably close to a bottom, with much of the risk
expunged. What am I going to do? Constantly repeat the rationale for
our decision process every time I get one of these calls? And, frankly,

required for successful investing is the commonsense analysis of

Michael Lauer's market philosophy is perhaps best summarized
by his comment that "this business is not about investing in great

by writing a monthly update letter and hosting a quarterly confer-
ence call.
Any final words?
Any investment approach that is dependent on stock market direction
for profitability is doomed to mediocrity. Any investment approach
that is heavily reliant on accurate forecasting or involves the purchase
of high-expectation stocks is inherently risky. Market supply and
demand forces create spectacular pricing inefficiencies. All that is

crucial point is that fundamentals are not bullish or bearish in a vac-
uum; they are bullish or bearish only relative to price. The greatest
company in the world could be a terrible investment if its price rise
has already more than discounted the bullish fundamentals. Con-
news negative with mbarded bo been has mpany that versely, a co
could be a great buy if its price decline has more than discounted the
bearish information.
Lauer believes in concentrating his portfolio into a small number
of holdings (fifteen stocks typically account for 75 percent or more
of assets). He believes broad diversification is a recipe for mediocrity:
"The greater the number of stocks you hold, the more marketlike
your performance becomes."
To winnow down the universe of U.S. stocks to a mere fifteen
core positions requires a very restrictive selection process. To end up
on Lauer's short list, a stock must pass six screens:
1. It must be a company and sector that Lauer fully understands.
(Obviously, this same principle would yield entirely different
results for different investors.)
2. The stock must have experienced a mammoth price decline rela-
tive to the market averages (50 percent or more). This rule will
cause Lauer to focus only on stocks that have been experiencing
wholesale liquidation, often by institutions. In effect, the only
stocks potentially good enough for Lauer are those that other
managers can't stand to hold.
3. The company must have a strong balance sheet and reasonable
cash flow.
4. There must be either insider buying or a company repurchase

Steve Watson has never had a problem taking risks. He fondly recalls the

Mountains. When he was eleven, he and his cousin thought it would be
"fun" to move up from capturing nonpoisonous snakes to the poisonous
variety. They found two large water moccasins. After pinning each snake
down with a long branch and grabbing it tightly just below the head,
they decided it would be a good idea to carry their quarry back to the
family cabin, approximately a mile downriver, to proudly show their
fathers what they had caught. After sloshing through the shallow river for
about half a mile, with the snakes wrapped around their arms and their

bile, they had some second thoughts. "Maybe this wasn't such a good
idea," they agreed. Finally, unable to maintain their grips for much
opposite darted in the water and longer, they hurled the snakes into the
direction. In comparison, buying and shorting stocks must seem pretty
tame.

I met with Watson in a conference room at his firm's Manhattan
office. He was relaxed and friendly, and spoke with an accent that
reflected his Arkansas origins.
When did you first get interested in the stock market?
I came from a family that never read The Wall Street Journal, never
bought a share of stock, and never invested in mutual funds. I didn't
know anything about the stock market until I was in college. When I
attended the University of Arkansas, I took an investment course that

The day before the presentation, someone in our group came up
with the bright idea of going to the local brokerage office and seeing
what they said about the stock. The brokerage firm had this beautiful
glossy report on the company, which was filled with all sorts of posi-
tive commentary and concluded with a recommendation to buy the

The next day, we gave our presentation, and the professor just tore
it apart. "This is a terrible company!" he exclaimed, citing a list of rea-
sons to support his conclusion—all of which had been in our original

What ultimately happened to the stock?
It went down. That's when I learned my first and most important les-
son about the stock market: Stick to your own beliefs.
Did that course clinch your decision to pursue a career in the
stock market?
Yes. After I graduated, I moved to Dallas, which was the only big city I
had ever visited, to look for a job as a stockbroker. I thought being a
stockbroker meant that you got to manage other people's money and
play the stock market all day long. I quickly found out that it was more
of a sales job, and quite frankly, I'm a terrible salesperson. I picked up

My new boss—who, incidentally, was one of the worst stock pickers I

high P/E stocks [stocks trading at large multiples of their earnings]
that were moving up rapidly, whereas I believed in buying value
stocks and doing a lot of detailed research on a company. I left about

my own fund.
Where did you get the money to start your fund?
But the assets of the fund were getting too large to bother with small
cap stocks, and the fund's focus shifted almost exclusively to mid cap
and large cap stocks, which made it harder to get a hold of the CFOs
and ask questions. Also, as the assets grew, the number of analysts
increased. When there are fifteen analysts, your performance doesn't
have too much impact on the fund. I wanted to be in a situation

Another aspect is that sell-side research tends to be biased; it is
driven by investment banking relationships. If a brokerage firm earns
several million dollars doing an underwriting for a stock, it is very dif-
ficult for an analyst of that firm to issue anything other than a buy rat-

Let's say a stock is trading in the 8 to 12 P/E range and you like
the fundamentals. How do you decide when to buy it? Obviously,
you're not using any technical analysis for timing, since you don't
even look at charts.

Give me an example of a catalyst that prompted you to buy a

A current example is Amerigon. Two weeks ago, they put out a press

information about the size of the contract. But by talking not only to
the company but also to someone at Ford, we know the contract is
huge. We also know that they're working on similar agreements with
the other car manufactures.
What is another example of a catalyst?
A change that will lead to a dynamic improvement in margins.
Another one of our long positions is Windmere, which is a manufac-

Any other examples of a catalyst?
Sometimes the catalyst can be a new product. One of our biggest
winners last year was LTXX, a semiconductor company. They had

about it because the sales of this new product hadn't shown up in
earnings reports. When the earnings starting showing up above
expectations, the stock took off.
If you buy a stock and it moves higher, when do you decide to liq-
uidate the position?
Too early [he laughs}. We are always rotating our stocks. If we buy a
stock at ten times earnings and it goes up, usually by the time it gets
to twenty times earnings, we are out of it. We will rotate the money
down to another stock with similar qualities so that we can keep the
risk/reward of the portfolio as low as possible. LTXX is a good exam-
ple. We started buying the stock around $5 and got out when it went

Give me an example of a flawed business plan.
My favorite theme for a short is a one-product company because if
that product fails, they have nothing else to fall back on. It's also
much easier to check out sales for a one-product company. A perfect
example is Milestone Scientific. The company manufactured a prod-

shots. It sounded like a great idea, and originally we started looking at
the stock as a buy prospect. One of our analysts
trade show and collected a bunch of business cards fr
dentists. The primary Wall Street analyst covering the stock assumed
every dental office would be buying five of these instruments, and he
projected unbelievably huge earnings.

things I tell my analysts is, "Make the calls. Maybe they won't talk to

Talking to companies and customers.

but as Lynch advises, the nonprofessional can call the investor rela-
tions office and still get valuable information by asking the right ques-
The gist of tions. Lynch's advice to the ordinary investor is: Invest in
what you know—the company you work for (assuming it is doing
well), companies in the same industry, or companies that make a
product you can touch and feel. His point is that people would be
much better off investing in companies they understand than listen-
ing to their broker and investing in companies they know nothing
about. One part of Peter Lynch's philosophy is that if you can't sum-
marize the reasons why you own a stock in four sentences, you proba-
bly shouldn't own it.

interviewed with Fidelity, which was right before I took the job at
Friess Associates, I got as far as meeting with Jeff Vinik [Lynch's ini-
tial successor as manager of the Magellan fund]. He asked me only
two questions, which will stick in my mind forever. First, he asked,
"What is the bond rate?" I was a stock guy who never paid attention to
the bond market. I subsequently learned that Vinik pays very close

long?" The interview was over in less than five minutes.
Do you, like Peter Lynch, get trading ideas by going to the mall?
All the time. I love going to malls. Investing is not as complicated as
people make it out to be. Sometimes it just requires common sense.

•poisonous snakes, which was described at this chapter's opening.
Did you feel any fear while you were holding those snakes?
No, I would describe the feeling as closer to excitement. I was a
pretty hyperactive kid.
Is there anything that you are afraid of?
I'm going skydiving next week—that scares me.
Why is that?
I thought about that. I realized what scares me—things I can't con-
trol. When I held those snakes, I had control. I'm planning to learn

He learned the lesson of not listening to was lucky: Watson Steve
stocks that are relatively low priced (low price/earnings ratio), a char-
acteristic that limits risk. A low price is a necessary but not sufficient
condition. Many low-priced stocks are low for a reason and will stay
others' opinions from a college course instead of with his own money.

Watson conducts extensive communication with companies and
their competitors, consumers, and distributors. He is also a strong
proponent of such commonsense research as trying a company's
product, or in the case of a retailer, visiting its stores. Finally, Watson
looks for insider buying as a confirmation condition for his stock
selections.
Shorting is considered a high-risk activity and is probably inap-
propriate for the average investor. Nevertheless, Watson demon-
strates that if risk controls are in place to avoid the open-ended
losses that can occur in a short position, shorting can reduce portfo-
lio risk by including positions that are inversely correlated with the
rest of the portfolio. On the short side, Watson seeks out high-priced

there is no barrier to entry for competitors.
Watson achieves risk control through a combination of diversifi-
cation, selection, and loss limitation rules. He diversifies his portfo-
lio sufficiently so that the largest long holdings account for a
maximum of 2 to 3 percent of the portfolio. Short positions are
capped at about 1.5 percent of the portfolio. The risk on long posi-
tions is limited by Watson's restricting the selection of companies
from the universe of low-priced stocks. On the short side, risk is lim-
ited by money management rules that require reducing or liquidating
a stock that is moving higher, even if the fundamental justification
for the trade is completely unchanged.
Watson has maintained the pig-at-the-trough philosophy he was

would have achieved a double-digit return in an manager extraordinarily
hostile environment.
During 1994—99 Dana Galante registered an average annual com-
pounded return of 15 percent. This may not sound impressive until one
considers that Galante is a pure short seller. In reverse of the typical
manager, Galante will profit when the stocks in her portfolio go down and
lose when they go up. Galante achieved her 15 percent return during a
period when the representative stock index (the Nasdaq, which accounts
for about 80 percent of her trades) rose by an imposing annual average of
Galante's performance in perspective, her achieve- 32 percent. To put
ment is comparable to a mutual fund manager averaging a 15 percent
annual return during a period when the stock market declines by an aver-

Galante likes trading the markets and enjoys the challenge of trying to
which is long the munity, m profit by going the opposite of the financial co
stocks that she shorts. But the markets are an avocation, not an all-
consuming passion. Her daily departure from the office is mental as well
as physical, marking a shift in her focus from the markets to her family.
She leaves work each day in time to pick up her kids up at school, a rou-
tine made possible by her western time zone locale, and she deliberately
avoids doing any research or trading at home.

I had independence as long as I was doing well, but every time the
market rallied, he wanted me to cover all my shorts. We fought a lot
because I didn't give in. One thing I did is that if Henry insisted I buy
a stock, I would buy it, but then immediately short another stock
against it. That way I would negate any effect he was trying to have on
the portfolio. I did well, but after two years, I couldn't take it anymore

It almost sounds as if he was gambling with the portfolio.
It sure appeared to be gambling. Looking back, it seemed that he
tried to hide these losses by marking up the prices on privately held
stock in his portfolio. He had complete discretion on pricing these
positions.
How was he able to value these positions wherever he wanted to?
Because they were privately held companies; there was no publicly
traded stock.
Is it legal to price privately held stocks with such broad discre-
tion:1
Yes. In respect to private companies, the general partner is given that
discretion in the hedge fund disclosure document. The auditors also

In the beginning it was about 10 percent, but as he lost more and

Another hedge fund manager I interviewed who also does a lot of
short selling said that the value of audits on a scale of 0 to 100
was zero. Do you agree?
Yes.
Even if it's a leading accounting firm?
Oh yeah.
How could hedge fund investors be aware whether a manager
was mispricing stocks in the portfolio?
The quarterly performance statements are required to show what per-
cent of the portfolio consists of privately held deals. His performance
was so good for so long that people didn't question it.

I use them for market timing. I think that is one of the things that has

my short position to five thousand shares.
What was your emotional response to this entire experience?
I was almost in shock because I felt a complete lack of control. I had
never experienced anything like it before. Most people are afraid to
go short because they think the risk is unlimited. That never both-
ered me. I consider myself pretty disciplined. I always thought that I

before it caused too much damage, which up to that point I had. But
here, the stock nearly tripled in one day, and I didn't know what to
do. I was numb.
I was struck by a horrifying thought: Could the same thing happen
to any of the other stocks in my portfolio? I began worrying about
which of my shorts would be the next company to announce an on-
line Web page. I started combing my portfolio, looking for any stock
that might become the next Sanchez.
What eventually happened to the stock?
It went back up again. But when Sanchez started to look like it was
ready to roll over, I rebuilt my short position. Ironically, when it sub-
sequently broke, I made more money on my new short position than I
had lost being short when the stock exploded several months earlier.
How large is your organization?
There are just two of us. Zack works with me and is an integral part
of Miramar. There is a lot of money out there, and interested
investors call me almost every day. I tell them that I am closed to new
investment.
Is that because your methodology can't accommodate any more
money?
I don't want to grow. I don't want to manage people; I want to manage
the portfolio.
d a e t s n i s n o ti si o p r e g r a l g n ki a t t s u y j b e z si r u o y w o r g u o y d ul o C
of expanding the number of shorts?
I have only run shorts in a bull market. It's a constant battle. I have to
find the best way to fight the battle with the lowest amount of risk. I
need to know that I can cover my short positions if I have to. The
larger my short position, the more difficult that would be. I've seen
what happens to people who grow too fast, and I have taken the oppo-
site extreme. I want to be comfortable doing what I do. I don't want to
be scouring for new shorts because I am managing more money. I
have my family, and when I go home, I don't think about work. I don't

I suppose to some extent your attitude reflects a difference

don't.
That's probably it.
How do you select the stocks you short?
I look for growth companies that are overvalued—stocks with high
P/E [price/earnings] ratios—but that by itself is not enough. There
also has to be a catalyst.
Give me an example of a catalyst.
An expectation that the company is going to experience a deteriora-
tion in earnings.
How do you anticipate a deterioration in earnings?
One thing I look for is companies with slowing revenue growth who
have kept their earnings looking good by cutting expenses. Usually, it's
only a matter of time before their earnings growth slows as well.
Another thing I look for is a company that is doing great but has a
competitor creeping up that no one is paying attention to. The key is
anticipating what is going to affect future earnings relative to market
expectations.
In essence, you look for a high P/E stock that has a catalyst that
will make the stock go down.
Right, but there is another key condition: I won't short a stock that is
moving straight up. The stock has to show signs of weakening or at
least stalling.
Can you give me an example of a typical short?
Network Associates has been a stock that I have been short on and off
for the past two years. The company was masking higher operating
expenses by taking huge research and development charges related to
acquisition each quarter. They were taking other expenses as one-
time charges as well. The SEC eventually made them change their
accounting procedures to take these expenses over time as opposed to
one-time charges. After the SEC stepped in, the chairman came out
and said something like, "It's just an accounting issue. We don't pay
much attention to accounting." He also made statements berating the
shorts, saying they would get buried.

What are some of the other screens?
We also screen for revenue deceleration, earnings deceleration, high
P/Es, high inventories, and some technical indicators, such as stocks
breaking below their fifty-day moving average.
Do you screen for these factors individually, or do you screen for

Usually multiple characteristics, but you can't screen for all these fac-
tors at one time, or else you won't get any stock that fits all the search

I paint the scene in my mind and visualize easily enough how it could
appear quite pleasant with the renewal of spring. But to see this land-
scape with the sense of majesty implied by Cook's voice, you have to look
at it through the eyes of someone who has worked the land and sees it as
a provider of sustenance and a link between generations.

carefully tracking the stock market, filling volumes of market diaries, and

What kind of questions would they ask you about a cow?
What kind of cow was she? Oh, how much milk did she produce?
How much crap did she produce in a day? How old was she? What
did she eat? Does she kick? How come she doesn't have any flies?
Whenever I got that last question, I said, "We give her a bath every
day; she's cleaner than you are."

becoming a trader?
After graduating college, I wanted to get a job as a stockbroker. I
couldn't get hired. Nothing in my resume seemed to help—not my
grades, nor the fact that I played college basketball. Finally, I rewrote
my resume, prominently mentioning that I had been Elsie's cowboy.
Shortly thereafter, I received a call to interview at a local brokerage
office in Canton, which ultimately led to a job offer. The woman who
screened resumes for the firm later told me, "I get hundreds of
resumes. When I saw yours I said, 'Hey, this is the guy who took care
of Elsie the Cow.'" I had been in Canton when I did the tour, and she
had remembered seeing the picture in the local newspaper. That's
how I got into the business, because of a cow.
Why did you want to become a stockbroker? Were you trading
stocks?

What about Sambo's?
When I went to the Rose Bowl with my fraternity brothers, we went
out to eat at a Sambo's. I had never heard of the chain before and
thought it was neat, so I bought the stock. That's a summary of my

"I don't know anything about options," I told him. He gave me a

"Oh no, it's just like trading stocks," he said.

$1,800 investment. I said to myself, "Boy, this is a lot easier than
shoveling manure and milking cows." For my next option trade, I
bought Teledyne calls again, and again I made money. I thought I
was going to be a millionaire in no time flat. I was doing so well that

margin on short-option positions at that time was sometimes The
less than the premium I collected from the sale of the options. In 1979
when gold prices exploded, I sold options on gold stocks. I figured out
that I could sell a combination [the simultaneous sale of a call and

trade. At that time, the margin department hadn't figured this out. As a
margin result, I could put on any size position and not get a call. There
was only one slight problem—the stock took off on me. I made a little
bit on the puts, which expired worthless, but lost a lot on the calls,
which went way in the money. It was back to the drawing board again.
How did you have enough money to cover your losses?
Oh, I was a very good broker. I was the second from the top first-year
broker nationwide for the firm. In 1981 I worked out a system for sell-

out a list of potential trades. Since I was selling options that were well
out-of- the -money, they almost always expired worthless. Every Friday
after the close, I would run the program, and every Monday morning,
I would put on the trades. I was rolling along making several thousand
dollars a month.
By May 1982, I had built my account up to $115,000. I reached
greater depths of greed. I thought that I'd perfected this and it was
working great. I stepped up the trading in my account and my family's
accounts. That month I made an additional $50,000 using the same
strategy.

shut down trading in the stock and options for the rest of the week
and didn't resume trading until after the option expiration. Of course,
the options got exercised [leaving Cook short one hundred shares for
each option he had sold], and by the time the stock started trading
again, I was down $500,000.
Did that include your family's accounts?

$100,000 apiece in accounts I had for my mother, father, and aunt. I
still have the trade slips right here in my desk drawer. It wasn't until
last year—seventeen years after this happened—that I was able to
pull them out and look at them. I had a margin call in excess of one
million dollars on my account, which is what I would have had to put
up if I wanted to hold the short stock position instead of buying it
back. Technically, you are supposed to have five days to meet the mar-
gin call, but the firm was on me to cover the position right away.

when I'm home early, she'll say, "Your trading must really be floating
along."
Most traders that I've talked to about losing periods say they
ease up or even take a break during those times.
I do just the opposite. Whenever I am down, the frequency of my
trading steps up.
But aren't you afraid that you will aggravate your losses by
doing that?
I increase my activity, not my exposure. In fact, the first thing I do
when I'm losing is to stop the bleeding. That's why I have this sign on
my computer. [He points to a sheet that reads GET SMALLER.] I don't
get out of the trade that is hurting me completely; I just reduce the
position size. Then the next trade that I do, I feel compelled to make
money. It doesn't matter how much. The point is to rebuild my confi-
dence. Even if I only make a few hundred dollars on that trade, it
shows that I can still make money. Once I have a winning trade, I'm

What advice would you give to other traders about handling los-
ing situations?
Hope should never be in your vocabulary. It is the worst four-letter
word I know. As soon as you say, "Boy, I hope this position comes
back," you should reduce your size.
G N TI S E V R A H S&P TS FI O R P
What about the flip side—winning streaks—any advice there?
Never increase the size of your positions on a winning streak. Other-
wise you guarantee that you will have your largest position on a losing
trade.
How long was it until you started trading again after the Cities
Service disaster?
Almost two years. The first trade I put on was in April 1984, right

Yes, I had developed my cumulative tick indicator. In 1986, I began
keeping a daily trading diary. Every day I wrote down recurrent pat-

would snap back, and the more positive it became, the more the mar-
ket would sell off. That's how I got the idea of keeping a cumulative
count on the tick, which evolved into my cumulative tick indicator. I
have never had this indicator fail, but you need nerves of steel to
trade with it because the market is always in a panic situation—usu-
ally because of an external news event—when the readings get
extreme.
I know your cumulative tick indicator is a proprietary measure,
but what can you tell me about it?
The calculation ignores periods when the tick is in a neutral band,

beyond these thresholds, a reading is recor
and added to a running total. When this total gets below the historical
5th percentile,. it signals an oversold situation [a buying opportunity],
and when it gets above the 95th percentile it signals an overbought
situation [a selling opportunity].
How long did it take you to recover the $350,000 trading deficit
that was left over from the Cities Service trade?
Five years, measured from the Cities Service trade, which was three
years after I resumed trading. The big year was 1987. When I say
ng uri d been short have ust m me that I matically assu people auto that,
the October crash, but I actually made most of the money during the
bull market earlier that year.
At that time I wasn't day trading yet. In May 1987 I saw what I
believed was a phenomenal buying opportunity in stock index call
options. Two factors had converged: my cumulative tick indicator was
giving extremely bullish readings, and the decline in volatility had
made the option premiums very cheap. My grandfather used to tell
me, "Buy things when people don't want them, and sell things when
people want them." I put $55,000 into long-term, out-of-the-money
stock index calls that were trading at !/2 to 5/s. [In this type of option
position, the trader can make multiples of the initial outlay if there is
other ment in any but lose the entire invest a huge price advance,

tors, I will buy the index that is relatively stronger that day. And if I get
a sell signal, I will sell the index that is relatively weaker.
What would be an example of a signal?
I have a trade that I called a "tick buy," which means that if the tick
gets to -1000, I will buy because the market will tend to snap back
after that point.

Can you give me any other examples of trades that you do.
One trade I call a "catapult trade" because it's just like a catapult,
which gets bent back until it springs and then the projectile flies over
a threshold. For example, if the S&P is trading back and forth in a

little higher, then I'll expect it to catapult above the top of the range
by the width of the range, or to 1356. The reason the trade works is
because stops tend to build up right above the catapult point.

may also go up, but it won't follow very tightly. Then they get engaged,
and the relationship becomes closer. Then they get married and go on

synchronous. On "honeymoon days" in the markets, when I see the
bonds go up a few ticks, I know the S&P will immediately follow, and
I will buy the S&P for a quick trade. After the honeymoon, when they
settle into married life, the bonds will drag the S&P husband along,
but they are not quite as joined as they once were. Then the couple
up, the go bonds whenever the ms, market ter or in gets estranged,
S&P will likely go down. Then comes the bitter divorce. On "divorce
days" the bonds and S&P will move in exactly opposite directions.
Every day, I make a determination of what type of day it is. Today, for
example, the bonds were going up, and the S&P was selling off. The
Street called it a "flight to quality," but to me it was just a "divorce day."
Did you ever manage money, or have you always traded just your
own account?
In 1989, I decided to get into money management. I asked people I
knew in the business what I needed to do as an unknown in the mid-
dle of nowhere to attract investors. One person suggested that I enter
money trading the U.S. Investing Championship [a now defunct real
contest] to attract greater public visibility. That was the first time I
had ever heard of this trading competition. Back in 1989, the contest
was held for four-month intervals. I entered the options division cate-

It seemed to me that just about every time I was in a trade and had to
do something quickly, a client would call and want to talk about util-
ity stocks or something equally urgent.
I opened a personal account with a clearing firm in New York that
also did business with other money managers. After my account had
been active for about three or four months, I received a call from

tually eliminated any profit opportunities if you were only a buyer of
options, as I was. Buying options then was like paying Rolls-Royce
prices for a Yugo.
Did you stop trading?
Yes, 1 had to back off. I have to believe a trade has at least a 75 per-
cent chance of being right or else I won't put it on. I continued to
trade very lightly over the next few months, and the account drifted
sideways.
At the end of April, the president of the company called again.
"How come you're not trading anymore?" he asked. "Are you afraid?"
he sneered.
"Yes, I'm afraid, but not of what you think. I'm afraid of the mar-
ketplace. 1 don't see trades that will give me my 75 percent probabil-
ity of winning, and I'm not going to do any coin-flip trades."

researched all my past trades back to the 1970s to find out why I had
made money and why I had lost money. I found that Tuesdays were
my best day and Fridays my worst.
Why is that?
Because it takes me a little while to get warmed up. Mondays I am
just getting back into gear, and by Tuesday I'm ready to roll. By the
time I get to Friday, I've exhausted my energy, and if I have done well
for the week, I just don't have the drive and zeal. So what did I do in
1992? I didn't trade on any Fridays, and I traded more aggressively on
Tuesdays.

If you decide to. trade for a living, you have to treat it just like any
other business endeavor and go into it with a plan. If you want to start
a business, and all you do is walk into a bank, smile pleasantly, and
ask for a $200,000 loan, do you think you'll get it? Are they going to
say, "You have a really nice smile; here's the money." I don't think so.
You need to have a solid business plan. The trouble is that most peo-
ple start trading without any definitive plan.

traders?
Approach trading as a vocation, not a hobby. I periodically give semi-
nars for traders. I once had a tennis pro who attended my four-day sem-
inar. On the third day, I asked people what they had learned so far and
how they were going to apply it. When it was his turn, he said, "I'm not
going to give up my tennis career. I give lessons on Tuesdays and Thurs-
days, so I'm going to trade on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays."

would've thought to walk up to the professor and say, "I know the
course is for a semester, but I think a week should be enough for me
to get it." Gaining proficiency is the same in trading as in any other
profession—it requires experience, and experience takes time.

All the reasons for failure you have mentioned so far relate to the
attitude with which people approach trading: a lack of commit-

It's not a matter of intelligence, or even market knowledge. I've seen
people with good trading skills fail, and those
experience succeed. The main thing is that every trader has to be
honest about his or her weakness and deal with it. If you can't learn to
do that, you will not survive as a trader.
Several years ago, an option trader who had scheduled to come
visit me at my office asked whether I would be willing to review his
trades for the past year before he came. I agreed because I genuinely
want to teach people how to trade.
He said, "I had 84 percent winning trades last year."

had his heart attack. I thought, "He's out there doing all that work for
$700 or $800, and I'm sitting in an air-conditioned office, making
$7,000 or $8,000." It didn't seem right to me, so I had to punish
myself. When I look back on the trades I did during that period, it
almost seems like temporary insanity.
Then you weren't doing your regular trades.
Oh no, I was doing almost the exact opposite.
Were you aware of what you were doing at the time?
I didn't care; I was totally despondent. I think I really wanted to lose

as looking at the ratio of potential gain to risk. As Cook demon-

Kidder, Fletcher founded his own firm, Fletcher Asset Management.
I visited Fletcher on one of those brutally hot, humid New York City
summer afternoons. I always prefer to walk in cities whenever possible as
opposed to taking taxis or public transportation. But 1 was running a bit
late for my scheduled interview with Fletcher, so I hopped a cab. The

By the time I arrived at Fletcher Asset Management, I must have
looked as if I had walked through a shower. The offices are located in a
120-year-old limestone townhouse on the Upper East Side. I stepped
through the large, heavy wooden door, moving from the heat and noise of
the modern city into a cool, quiet, and elegant interior. The entranceway
led to a large circular reception area with soaring ceilings and a hand-

I was led into a library that served as a waiting room and was offered
a large pitcher of ice water, which I rapidly gulped down as soon as the
attendant left the room. After about ten minutes, I was escorted up the
staircase to Fletcher's office.

only at returns suffer from extreme naivete. It is not return that matters,
but rather return relative to risk. Here Fletcher shines. The Fletcher
Fund, his flagship fund, founded in September 1995, has realized an
average annual compounded return of 47 percent. Although this is quite
impressive on its own, here is the lacker: He has achieved this return
with only four losing months, the largest of these being a minuscule 1.5
percent decline.

When did you first develop an interest in the markets?
It probably started when I was in junior high school and my father
and I worked on developing a computer program to pick winners at
the dog racetrack. [He laughs robustly at ike memory.]
Did you have any success trying to forecast dog races?
Oh yes. The computer would eliminate one set of races it couldn't
predict. In the remaining races, the program had an 80 percent accu-
racy rate in picking a dog that would place in the money [win, place,
or show].
That's pretty impressive. How much money did you make?

When did you actually get involved with stocks?
When I was in college, I had a summer job with Pfizer, and they had
an employee program that allowed you to buy stock in the company
for a 25 percent discount. That sounded like a great deal to me. Iron-
ically, as we fast-forward to the present, both of these principles—the

hallmarks of what we do today. Of course, I don't mean this literally,

who's going to be the winner. Nevertheless, those concepts tie into
our current strategies in a remarkable way.
Let's go back to your origins. How did you actually get involved
in trading the market?
I graduated Harvard with a math degree. At the time, everyone was
going into M.B.A. programs or Wall Street.
As a math major at Harvard, I assume that you must have had

Yes indeed [he laughs loudly]. In many respects, I still believe it, but
as you'll see, there is an interesting other side.
You believe it—in what sense? After all, your own performance
seems to belie the theory that markets are perfectly efficient.
If IBM is trading at $100 right now, it's probably worth $100. I think
it is very difficult to outsmart liquid markets.

That's correct.
So where doesn't the efficient market hypothesis apply—say in

very differently, and persistently treated differently, then it should
be possible to set up a transaction that offers a consistent
opportunity.
Give me a specific example.
Instead of IBM, say we're talking about an Italian computer com-

has been paid, buy it back at terms that would be beneficial to both

How could you ever lose in that type of transaction?
Very easily. It is very important that there is a real economic trade in
which the Italian investor actually buys the shares and is the holder of
those shares at the time of the dividend payment. If

Given the substantial transaction costs (commissions plus

You're quite right. Normally, the interest rate differences are not suffi-

corporation would be much better off because the return is a capital

like 11 percent.
Where do you get your income on the trade?
Initially, we made money either by implementing the transaction for

I had no specific responsibilities; I was just told to figure out how to
add value to the company. I started a couple of months before the
1987 stock crash. While all my friends are trading stocks and bonds,
and the market is crashing and layoffs are going on, I'm sitting there
without any specific responsibility and a mission to figure out how to
make money in the Bear Stearns style.
And exactly what is that?
To commit very little capital, take on very little risk, and still make a
significant return consistently. And if you can't do that, they don't
want to put their money into the trade. They are a very smart firm.

Frankly, whenever there's a difficult situation, race is always one of
those easy cards to play. For example, if someone is envious. Usually,

I do the best I can for the people who put their trust in me—my
investors, my employees, and the companies I invest in—then every-
thing else will take care of itself.
When I read about the whole episode, I thought it was pretty
gutsy of you to bring a legal suit instead of taking a settlement. I

bothered with reinvestment. We would therefore be the recipient of
$1 million of dividends and then elect to reinvest it, receiving $1.05
million of newly issued stock.
Why would a company give you more stock than the amount of
the dividend?
Because the companies that provided this offer wanted to conserve
their capital and were willing to grant shareholders a 5 percent dis-
count as an incentive to reinvest their dividends in the stock.
Is it common for companies to offer this type of dividend rein-
vestment?

cut their dividends but need to preserve capital. For example, it was
particularly prevalent among the banks in the early 1990s when they
were trying to increase their equity.
Eventually, some companies started to offer shareholders the
option to purchase additional discounted shares in an amount equiv-
alent to the dividend reinvestment. Then some companies began
waiving limits, allowing investors to buy virtually any amount of stock
at a discounted price.
In the early 1990s, many banks were actively pursuing this type
of program, and we participated heavily. That experience led us to

thought about taking on outside capital?"
Didn't the idea of raising outside capital to fund your transac-

Sure, the idea had come up a number of times before. However, every
time we considered it, we asked ourselves why we should take money
from investors, and give up the bulk of the profits, when we can bor-
row money to do the deal, and keep 100 percent of the profits?
Exactly, so why did you start a fund open to outside investors?
The big change was realizing that a friend like Steve could get us in the
door where such a great transaction could happen. Wouldn't it be nice

weeks after the deal was completed, the company announced that all
their financial statements were wrong and would be revised for the
past two years. The stock dropped over 70 percent overnight. It hap-

The two other main themes to Fletcher's trading success are
innovation and risk control. Although the specifics of Fletcher's
approach are not directly applicable to ordinary investors, these two
principles still represent worthy goals for all market participants.

When Ahmet OkumilS was sixteen years old, he visited the trading floor of the
recently opened Istanbul Stock Exchange and was mesmerized. He was
fascinated by trading, which on the Istanbul exchange resembled specu-
lating far more closely than investing. It wasn't long before his initial
enthusiasm became an obsession, and he began cutting classes regularly
to trade stocks on the exchange.
Okumus knew that he wanted to become a money manager and real-

his goal was the United States. In 1989, he immigrated to the United
States, ostensibly to attend college but with the firm conviction that this
was just a stepping-stone to his true career objective. Using a $15,000
stake from his mother, Okumus began trading U.S. stocks in 1992. This
original investment had mushroomed to over $6 million by early 2000, an
average annual compounded return of 107% (gross returns). In 1997, he
launched his first hedge fund, the Okumus Opportunity Fund.

Using that approach, I assume you miss a lot of stocks.
Certainly, but my main goal is to make money on every investment,
not necessarily to catch every trade. I don't have to make a lot on each
trade, as long as I make something. Since 1992, 90 percent of my
trades have been winners.

pointed out that your odds in a stock are

How do you measure
I compare the amount of stock someone buys with his net worth and
salary. For example, if the amount he buys is more than his annual
t. n ary, I consider that significa
So you're looking at a breakdown of insider buying statistics, not
just the total numbers.

Is insider buying an absolute prerequisite, or will you sometimes

Most of the time I won't. I want to see the insiders putting their
wns ment already o money in their own company. Of course, if manage
a significant portion of the company, they don't have to buy more. For
example, insiders already own about 65 percent of the shares in J. D.
Edwards—a stock I currently like—so I don't need to see any addi-
tional buying. In contrast, in some companies, insiders only own
about 1 percent of the firm. In companies with low insider owner-
ship, management's primary motivation will be job security and
higher bonuses, not a higher stock price.

How are you aware of all the stocks that have witnessed signifi-

stocks, I have never owned a stock that made a new high. I think that

Are you implying that when you flip through the charts, you only

That's correct, with one exception: If the stock has been moving

Selling puts represents a bullish position. The seller of a put
receives a premium for the obligation to buy a stock at a price called
Not all. If it's a company that 1 know well and the fundamentals are
very strong, I might go long, even if the stock is significantly above its
low. For example, Microchip Technology is currently at $35, which is
well below its high of $50, but also well above last year's low of $15.
Even though it's well off its low, I'm still selling puts in the stock
because their business is improving tremendously.
the strike price
will happen if which
during the life span of the option. This obligation is
activated if the option is exercised by the buyer,
the stock price is below the strike price at the option expiration.
For example, assume that a stock is trading at $13 and that a put
option on the stock with a $10 strike price is trading at $1. If the
stock is trading above $10 when the option expires, the seller will
have a $1 profit per share (a $100 profit per option contract, which
represents 100 shares). If the stock is trading below $10 at the option
expiration, the option will presumably be exercised, and the seller of
the option will be required to buy the stock at $ 10, no matter how low
the stock is trading.
Okumus, who typically sells puts with strike prices below the cur-
rent market price (called out-of-the-money puts), will earn a profit
equal to the option premium paid by the option buyer if the stock
declines modestly, remains unchanged, or goes up. However, if the

[exercise the put option, requiring Okumus to buy the stock at the
strike price]. I don't sell a put on a stock unless I would be happy to
own the stock at the strike price.
For example, I'm currently short some $10 puts on J. D. Edwards,
which is trading near $13. I hope they put me the stock because I
would love to own it at $ 10. If they do, I'll still have the premium, and
if I buy the stock at $ 10, I know I will make money.
But most of the time when I sell puts, the market never declines
enough for the option to be exercised. This, of course, is okay too
because I still keep the premium as a profit.

In other words, selling put options is an alternative way for you
to be buying stocks. If it doesn't go down to the strike price, you
still earn the premium, and if does go down to the strike price,
that's also fine because that's the price you would have bought
the stock at anyway.

What you are doing sounds like the exact opposite of Peter
Lynch, who says you should go for a "ten-bagger" [buy stocks that
you think can increase tenfold]; you're not even going for a dou-
ble, or even close to it.

Most of your trading history has been with a small amount of
money. Now that you have started a fund and are doing well, that
amount will increase dramatically. How will trading much larger
sums of money affect your approach?
It won't change anything. The stocks I buy are all well-known names
with lots of liquidity. This is deliberate. When I first started, my atti-
tude was that I had to think big. Therefore I made sure to adopt a
style that could be used with much larger sums of money.

One element of market success frequently cited by Market Wiz-

trading adage: Cut your losses short. Yet Okumus's methodology

not believe in liquidating a stock position because it shows a loss. In
fact, if a stock he buys moves lower, he may even buy more. How can

although none are particularly easy to find or to stay on. Cutting

Initially, he lost everything—an experience he describes in the interview.
He realized that his worst mistake had been depending on others for
advice, so he embarked on an intensive program of self-education and
research.
After nearly a decade of research and market experience, Minervini
developed a well-defined trading methodology. In mid-1994, confident
that his trading approach was sufficiently refined, and encouraged by his
steadily improving performance, Minervini consolidated his various
accounts into a single account that was to become his track record. (Pre-

Amazingly, Minervini achieved his lofty gains while keeping his risk very
low: He had only one down quarter— barely—a loss of a fraction of 1
percent.
Minervini launched his own hedge fund, the Quantech Fund, LP, in
2000. He is also president of the Quantech Research Group, an institu-
tional research firm that provides stock selections based on Minervini's
proprietary selection methodology. Minervini spends his days managing

and I never buy stocks under $12. My basic philosophy is: Expose
your portfolio to the best stocks the market has to offer and cut your
losses very quickly when you're wrong. That one sentence essentially
describes my strategy.

addition, if you put yourself in a position to buy stocks that have the

I meant at the very beginning. How did you go from losing all
your money following a broker's tip to developing your own suc-
cessful methodology?
It was a slow, gradual process that took years of research and trading
experience. I also read just about every book I could find on the mar-
kets and successful individuals. Out of the hundreds of books that I
d a b a s a g n i h t h c u s y n a s i e r e h t k n i h t t n' o
read, there were probably no more than ten that had a major influ-
ence on me. However, I d

Okay, tell me a sentence that changed your life.
"The fruits of your success will be in direct ratio to the honesty and

What other lessons did you get out of that book?
There were many important messages. The basic message is not to
have a rigid opinion; the market is never wrong. He also talked about
the need for patience, not only in waiting for the right moment to

message that really hit home with me was the importance of protect-

What changed for you after reading Livermore's book?
I was astonished at how relevant the book still was to today's market.
It inspired me to go back and look at the stocks of the early 1900s and
even earlier. I found that there is really nothing different in the mar-
kets. I was amazed at how many of Livermore's observations matched

many times.
Early on, when I got stopped out of a position, that was it. I wiped
it out of my mind and st
notice, however, that many times I would get stopped
then look at it a few months later and see that it had doubled or even
tripled. 1 would exclaim to myself, "God, I was in that stock!" I real-
was ized that I needed to develop a plan to get back on board after I
stopped out of a position.
a g n i r e t n e e r n i d e v l o v n i y t l u c i f f i d l a c i g o l o h c y s I guess there is a p
position at a higher price after you've been stopped out.
Yes, and even worse, you might get stopped out again. If you are, can
you get in a third time? I can do it as many times as necessary to get
the trade right. Sometimes when a stock stops you out several times,
it sets up as a much higher probability trade.
Can you give me a specific example?
Let's say I buy a stock because of a signal by my model and the mar-
ket dips enough to stop me out. The stock then witnesses a huge
reversal and closes near the high of the day. That price action may be
an indication that there was a shakeout, which knocked out most of
osi- p g n o he l g t n utti P p. the weak hands, and the stock is ready to go u
tion back on at that point may well be a higher probability trade than
the original trade.
In that type of situation, do you get in on the close or on the next
opening?
It depends. I have specific setups that must be met before I enter the

I also realized that by holding on to some of my losing positions for
extended periods of time, I was tying up my capital. Therefore, the
impact of the large losers went beyond the losses themselves, since

my losses was astronomical.
Based on your earlier comments, you are obviously risking far
points?
less than the 10 percent maximum loss cap you used in this
study. How do you decide where to place your stop-loss
Not every trade I put on is the same. I will use much wider stops on
long-term trades than short-term trades. I will also use much wider
stops when I think the market is in the early stages of a bull move
than if I think the market is overdone and due for a correction. The
essential principle is that the stop-loss point should be a function of
the expected gain.
Do any other experiences stand out as important in your trans-
formation into a highly successful trader?
I learned not to impose any artificial restrictions on my upside poten-
tial. At one point during the summer of 1995, I was up over 100 per-
cent year to date, which achieved my original goal for the entire year.
I was seriously considering booking the year. A friend of mine asked,
"What makes you think you can't make 200 percent?" I thought about
it for a day or two, and said to myself that he's right. I ended that year
up 407 percent.
I know you use both fundamental and technical analysis. Do you
weight one more than the other?
Roughly speaking, I would y m y a s weighting s i fifty-fifty. ut B there s i
Why is that?
Because the price action may be telling you that the stock is dis-
counting a potential change in the fundamentals that is not yet evi-
dent. The combination of strong price action and weak current
fundamentals often occurs in turnaround companies or companies
with a new technology whose potential is not yet widely understood.
How many charts do you review each day?
I run preliminary computer screens on roughly ten thousand com-
panies and narrow the list down to about eight hundred stocks.
Each night, 1 review the charts for all these stocks. My first pass-
through is very quick, and on average I'll spot about 30 to 40 stocks
that look interesting. I then review these stocks more closely, scruti-
nizing the company's fundamentals, if I haven't already done so
recently, and select several that might be considered for purchase
the next day.
an important distinction between the relative importance I assign to
price action versus fundamentals. Although I would never bet on my
fundamental ideas without some confirming price action, I might
consider buying a stock with apparent negative fundamentals if its
relative price performance is in the top 2 percent of the market.

What kind of price patterns are you looking for when you put on
a trade?
1 don't use the conventional chart patterns. I don't find them particu-
larly useful.
So what do you look for in a chart?
Many of the patterns that I have observed and found useful are more
complex variations of conventional chart patterns. I have a list of pat-
terns that I've named. These are patterns that repeat over and over.
They have repeated since the 1800s, and they will repeat forever.
When I look at charts and see these patterns, I don't know how any-
one in the world could miss them. But, of course, they do, just as I
did early in my career.
How many of these patterns are there?
About twenty.
Can you provide one as an example.
I'd rather not.
How did you discover these patterns?
I started with common chart patterns and found that they worked

get in at what I call the "point of smooth sailing." A so-called failed sig-
nal can actually be the beginning of a more complex pattern that is far
more reliable than the initial signal based on a conventional pattern.
For example.
For example, assume a stock breaks out of a trading range on high
buy it, and then the stock collapses. People me. It looks great. volu In
this scenario, most people will view the original breakout as a failed
technical signal. The original breakout, however, may be only the
beginning of a more complex pattern that is far more reliable than the
breakout itself.
Could you detail one of these patterns?
I don't want to do that. It's not that I think revealing them would

I assume you use these price patterns as triggers to get you into a
trade. Do you also use them to get out of a trade?
Yes.

Yes and no. The same patterns are interpreted differently, depend-
Because it's not what's important to trading successfully. What is
important is controlling your losses and having a plan. Besides, for
someone to be successful, they have to develop their own methodol-
ogy. 1 developed my method for myself; it wouldn't necessarily be a
good fit for anyone else.
Although I am convinced that Minervini believes this is true, I also think
he doesn't want to divulge any of his original chart analysis because, on
some level, he obviously must think that such a disclosure might
adversely affect the efficacy of the patterns he uses, which is perfectly
reasonable. My further efforts to get him to provide some specifics about
his chart methodology proved futile. He didn't even want to reveal the
names of his chart patterns on the record; he read a list of their names to
me only after I had turned off my tape recorder.

When you said earlier that you don't look at conventional chart
patterns, do you mean to imply that you don't attach any signifi-
cance to breakouts to new highs?
No, a stock going to a new high is typically a bullish event because
the market has eliminated the supply ol: all previous buyers who had a
loss and were waiting to get out at even. That's why stocks often run

are only happy investors; all the miserable people are out.
But don't stocks often break out to new highs and then come
right back into the prior range?
That usually doesn't happen if you buy breakouts to new highs
after a correction to the first leg in a bull trend. In that case, stocks
usually take off like a rocket after they break out to new highs. Less
skilled traders wait to buy the stock on the pullback, which never
comes.
When do you get breakouts that fail?
In the latter stages of a bull market after the stock has already run up
dramatically. Chart patterns are only useful if you know when to
apply them; otherwise, you might as well be throwing darts.

First and foremost, understand that you will always make mistakes.
The only way to prevent mistakes from turning into disasters is to
accept losses while they are small and then move on.

of the moment; they have a contingency plan. The most important
contingency plan is the one that will limit your loss it you are wrong.
Beyond that, you need a plan to get back into the trade if you're
stopped out. Otherwise, you'll often find yourself getting stopped out
of a trade, and then watching the position go up 50 percent or 100
percent while you're on the sidelines.

Interestingly, the methodology that Minervini eventually devel-

novice, which was buying low-priced stocks that were making new
lows. Success required not merely the adaptability to modif
tial approach, but also the flexibility to acknowledge that his original

preclude long-term success, as long as one is receptive to change.

How do you go from chemistry to the sale of financial invest-

As a plug to BU, my degree in chemistry has been extremely helpful.
I think that a physical science degree is as good as if not better than a
financial degree because it trains you to be analytical. If there is any-
thing I am really good at, it's being a researcher. I'm not a particularly
good trader. When I got out of school, I was sick and tired of studying,
and I just wanted to make money. I got a job in sales using my chem-

because of limitations that the company placed on me, I realized
that if I wanted to take the next step, I would have to do something

to call individuals and that it made a lot more sense to call institutions.

Hadn't the idea of trading occurred to him before?
I think he was somewhat conservative. He had a good position at
IBM, which he was reluctant to give up. He had been writing the
newsletter on the side. I convinced him to leave IBM. In the first ten
months I raised approximately $10 million. After the first year, he was
up about 9 percent with a lot of volatility. I realized that this was not
for me—the equity swings were just too volatile relative to the
mediocre returns being realized.

you a successful person in whatever you're doing are going to make
you successful in trading. You have to be very decisive, extremely dis-

those traits. Therefore, when I decided to become a money manager,
it didn't require a leap of faith to believe that I would be successful.

up a few percent. By March 1995, I had systematized my approach
and felt confident that I had come up with something that would
work. I implemented an embryonic version of what I do now.
That implies that you have changed your system very substan-
tially since you first started. Were these changes a consequence
of ongoing research, or were they triggered by your trading
experiences?
I had several important events in my track record that caused me to
change significantly from what I had started out doing. I had a very
good first year. 1 finished 1995 with a 58 percent gain and no losing
months from the time I adopted my systematic approach.

me it was a huge amount. Because of that drawdown, I spent an enor-
mous amount of time doing research on the computer and ended up
making very significant changes to my methodology.

quarter of 1997 combined, 1 was up only a little over 1 percent. This
was definitely not what I was looking for. I realized that I had to make
some changes. During that period, I was on the computer all day,
almost every day. In March 1997, 1 implemented some very signifi-

There is never any judgment whether to buy or sell; the only judg-
ment is how much to buy or sell. The problem with system trading is
that it doesn't tell you how to trade your portfolio; it just gives you buy
and sell signals. I trade several different systems, each based prima-
rily on one indicator. I might have a system that has been performing
extremely well give me a buy signal, but I may decide to take a
smaller-than-normal position because other systems are giving me
contradictory indications.
What is another example of judgment causing you to deviate
from the strict signals of your system?
ms are my syste while, been trending up for a has market Let's say the
long, and I'm making a lot of money. Although everything may look
great, I get uncomfortable when my equity line starts going above its
long-term uptrend. I am likely to cut back my position size, anticipat-
ing that the equity line will come back to the long-term trend. Judg-
ment like that saves me money rather than makes me money.
Judgment is also important in deciding which systems I use. Inter-
estingly, the systems I used a few years ago are not doing particularly
well anymore. Somehow I've been successful in changing so that I'm

do it. I guess it must be intuition.
If you stop trading a system because it shows some deterioration,
do you sometimes go back to using it several years later?
No, because I replace inferior systems with superior systems. There
is a reason why I replace trading systems, and the reason is that I
have a better idea. I still keep an eye on old trading systems, but I
won't use them.

I think it's because eventually enough people figure it out. When too
many people jump on the bandwagon, the market takes it away. That's
why 1 would be very skeptical about anyone being able to buy a trad-

acceptable level of risk.

If too many people are using the same system, what mechanism
in the marketplace causes the system to self-destruct?
I can't answer that question. It could just be a matter of too many
people on the same side of the trade at the same time. Everything I
have experienced tells me that systems have a life span, and not a ter-
ribly long life span.
That speaks to the death of systems; what about the birth of sys-
tems? Will systems start working at some point in time, say 1994,
and then stop working a few years later? Or if you tested the sys-
tems you are currently using over the past twenty or thirty years,
would you find that they worked over the entire time span, but
it's just a matter of your not finding them until more recently?

they did. They stopped working because too many people started

I love playing poker.
I assume the stakes you are playing at are not terribly meaning-

stay in every hand, and it wouldn't make any difference to
you.
It's pretty hard to get concerned about losing $200 when you've just
lost $100,000, but 1 never let my income level interfere with the way

But that 50 percent assumption presupposes that you don't have
any edge in the market. Couldn't you have found patterns that

I had outpatient surgery with general anesthesia. I returned home at
around 11 A.M., very groggy, and went straight to bed. My wife was

How did you first get interested in the stock market?
My dad traded for a living back in the 1970s. When I was about
eleven or twelve, I became curious about what he did and asked him
a lot of questions. He gave me a book to read, When to Sell Stocks by
Justin Mammis. Note that the title of the book wasn't When to Buy
Stocks, but When to Sell Stocks. My dad's focus was mainly on short
selling.

I decided to go to business school, which allows you to put off the
decision of doing anything for another couple of years. I applied to
Emory, which is a local school, and I didn't bother applying anywhere
else. I was told by the admission officer that they'd love to have me,
which I found out was one of work experience, but I didn't have the
the entry requirements at Emory at the time. The only work experi-
ence I had was mowing lawns and summer jobs at a steel mill, which
didn't exactly qualify.

Forced issue in what sense?
I was fired. I had a number of discretionary accounts that were below
the firm's minimum. The office manager said, "You can't trade these
accounts below the company minimum."
I said, "Yes I can."
He said, "No you can't. You're out of here!"

Why is that?
Because anytime you're trying to make money for both the firm and
the client, there is a built-in conflict. 1 wanted to manage money on a
performance basis because I thought it was far cleaner. I had some
ethical problems with the brokerage business.

All types of inputs, but I found that the catalysts outweighed every-
thing else. As a result, the model ended up focusing almost com-
pletely on the catalysts.
What exactly do you mean by catalysts':'
A catalyst is an event or an upcoming event that has the potential to
trigger a stock price move by changing the market's perception about
a company.
Isn't a catalyst by definition a one-time event? How do you model
one-time events?
Most catalysts are repetitive events—earnings are reported four times
a year; retail companies report same-store sales monthly; airline com-
ors oad fact ort l p nies re pa monthly, n. o so nd a
How do you use an event such as an earnings report to make
trading decisions?
There have been lots of academic studies to show that stocks with
positive earnings surprises tend to outperform the market, but the
margin of improvement is relatively moderate. Frequently, you may
find that when you buy a stock after a positive earnings surprise, you
are buying it near a price peak because the earnings surprise was
already discounted.

How could it be discounted if it was a "surprise"?
We are talking about two different things. An "earnings surprise" is
defined by academics and Wall Street as a number that is above or

the market is probably not going to discount that event.
What is your balance between longs and shorts?
Our net position averages about 40 percent net long and has ranged
between 90 percent net long and 10 percent net short. A typical
breakdown would be 50 percent long and 10 percent short, with the
remainder in cash.
That's a pretty large portion to keep in cash.
We have a dual mission: to make money for our investors and to pre-
serve capital. Keeping about 40 percent in cash acts as a performance
stabilizer.
How are you able to trounce the index returns while keeping
such a large portion of your capital in cash?

Hundreds. When you order business cards, you get a huge stack of

marketing. Instead, I use the back of my business cards to jot down
trade lessons. For any trade that I find instructive regarding market
behavior, I'll write down the stock symbol and a brief summary of
what I think I learned from the trade. That's how I developed and

I believe that writing down your trading philosophy is a tremen-
dously valuable exercise for any investor. Writing down your trading
ideas helps clarify your thought process. I can remember spending
many weekends at the library writing down my investment philoso-
phy: what catalysts I was looking for; how I expected them to affect a
stock; and how I would interpret different price responses. I must
have accumulated over five hundred pages of trading philosophy.

approach.
What other advice do you have for investors?
One of the benefits of having been a retail broker is that 1 got to see a

take a step back and think about what you are doing, you can avoid a
lot of mistakes.
Masters's approach can be summarized as a four-step process:
1. Learn from experience. For any trade that is instructive (winner or
loser), write down what you learned about the market from that
trade. It doesn't make any difference whether you keep a trader's

they occur.

whenever one of the following three conditions are met: (a) his
profit objective for the trade is realized; (b) the expected catalyst JOHN BENDER

stock fails to respond within a predefined length of time (the

For the fund, Bender reduced his leverage by a fact
4 to 1 (which because of the effect of monthly compounding reduced
the annual return by a greater amount), placing a strong emphasis on
a peak to uity q e an m o ne fr decli risk control. To date, the fund's worst

dreds of millions in his own fund, Bender also manages an undisclosed

mutually coincident visit to New York. The only problem was that my
meet for a late dinner. We decided to schedule was already booked solid.
DUESTIONING
To simplify the logistics, Bender booked a room at my hotel.
S U O I V B O E H T
We met in our hotel lobby before leaving for dinner. It was an
extremely warm summer evening. Bender was wearing a suit and tie,
while I had considered substituting Dockers for jeans a sufficient con-
cession to being dressed for dinner. Bender, who had made the reserva-
tions, expressed concern whether I would be allowed

as well, and somewhat envious of the fact that I had gotten away going
casual. His large frame seemed to strain in his more formal clothes.
The interview was conducted over a wonderful multicourse meal in
a sushi restaurant. We left nearly four hours later, just short of mid-
night, when we suddenly realized that we were the last remaining diners
and that the staff was milling about impatiently, waiting for us to depart.
We took a brief break upon returning to the hotel, I to visit my
orphaned wife, who had accompanied me to the city, and Bender to
check on trades on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in which his firm is a
heavy participant. When we met again in the hotel lobby fifteen min-

Because it implies that your results depend on luck. The people that

How have you been able to make such consistent gains trading
options?
To make money in options, you don't need to know what the price of
the stock is going to be; all you need to know is the probability distri-
at price levels different at being of a stock probabilities [the
the time of the option expiration].*

The standard approach, which is based on the Black-Scholes for-
mula, assumes that the probability distribution will conform to a nor-
mal curve [the familiar bell-shaped curve frequently used to depict
probabilities, such as the probability distribution of IQ scores among
the population]. The critical statement is that it "assumes a normal
probability distribution." Who ran out and told these guys that was
the correct probability distribution? Where did they get this idea?
[The Black-Scholes formula (or one of its variations) is the widely used
equation for deriving an option's theoretical value. An implicit assump-
*A probability distribution is simply a curve that shows the probabilities of some event
occurring—in this case, the probabilities of a given stock being at any price on the
option expiration date. The x-axis (horizontal line) shows the price of the stock. The
probability of the stock being at different y-axis (vertical line) shows the relative
prices. The higher the curve at any price interval, the greater the probability that the
stock price will be in that range when the option expires. The area under the curve in
any price interval corresponds to the probability of the stock being in that range on
the option expiration date. For example, if 20 percent of the area under the curve lies
between 50 and 60, it implies that there is a 20 percent chance of the stock being
between 50 and 60 on the option expiration date. As another example, if 80 percent
of the area under the curve corresponds to prices under 60, the 60 call option, which
gives the holder the right to buy the stock at 60, would have an 80 percent chance of
expiring worthless.
The shape of the probability distribution curve, which is a snapshot of the proba-
bilities of prices being at different levels on the option expiration date, will determine
the option's value. The true shape of this curve is unknown, of course, and can only

A normal distribution would be appropriate if stock price move-
ments were analogous to what is commonly called "the drunkard's
walk." If you have a drunkard in a narrow corridor, and all he can do is
lurch forward or backward, in order for his movements to be consid-
ered a random walk, the following criteria would have to be met:

2. He has to lurch forward by exactly the same distance he lurches

these conditions. Stock prices, I would argue, don't even come close

If I understand you correctly, your basic premise is that stock
price movements are not random and therefore the assumption
that prices are normally distributed, which everyone uses to
determine option values, cannot be the accurate mathematical
representation of the true market. Does that imply that you've
come up with an alternative ? l e d o m g n i c i r p n o i t p o l a c i t a m e h t a m
Not in the sense that you are probably thinking. It's not a matter of
coming up with a one-size-fits-all model that is better than the stan-
dard Black-Scholes model. The key point is that the correct probability
distribution is different for every market and every time period. The
probability distribution has to be estimated on a case-by-case basis.
If your response to Bender's last comment, which challenges the core
premises assumed by option market participants, could best be summa-
rized as "Huh?," and assuming that you really care, then you should prob-

The best example I can think of involves the gold market rather than
stocks. Back in 1993, after a thirteen-year slide, gold rebounded above
the psychologically critical $400 level. A lot of the commodity trading

assuming that the long-term downtrend had been reversed. Most of
these people use models that will stop out or reverse their long posi-

gradually to $390 and then went almost immediately to $350 as each
stop order kicked off the next stop order.
The Black-Scholes model doesn't make these types of distinc-
probability that it mes that the $405, it assu tions. If gold is trading at

than the probability that it will be trading at $385. What I'm saying is
that under the right circumstances, it might actually be more likely
that gold will be trading at $360 than at $385. If my expectations,
which assume nonrandom price behavior, are correct, it will imply
profit opportunities because the market is pricing options on the
assumption that price movements will be random.
Could you give me a stock market example?
I'll give you a stock index example. Last year [1998], it was my belief
that stocks were trading on money inflows rather than their own
intrinsic fundamentals. IBM wasn't going up because the analysts
m earning strea Here's the future " saying, and M B were looking at I
and we predict the price should rise to this level." IBM was going up
because people were dumping money into the market, and managers
were buying IBM and other stocks because they had to invest the
money somewhere.
A market that is driven by inflows can have small corrections, but
it has to then immediately recover to new highs to keep generating
new money inflows. Otherwise, money inflows are likely to dry up,

recover right away; the next stop was down 20 percent. I made an
enormous amount of money on that move.
Each of your examples has been very market specific. If I said to
you that you could come up with any alternative model you
wished instead of Black Scholes, but you had to apply it to all
markets, could you do any better than Black-Scholes?
No, given that restriction, the assumption that prices are random is as
good as any other assumption. However, just because Black and
Scholes used a one-size-fits-all approach doesn't mean it's correct.

time was a constant seemed so apparent that the alternative was not
even considered. By questioning the obvious and realizing that the
accepted view had to be wrong (that is, time was variable and

the history of science.
One of the basic tenets of option theory is that the probabilities of

predicted by a normal curve and have adjusted the curve accordingly.
(They made the tails of the curve fatter.) Bender, however, has gone
much further. He has questioned the very premise of using a normal
curve as the starting point for describing prices. He has also ques-
tioned the convention of using a single model to describe the price
behavior—and by implication option prices—of different markets and
stocks. By ditching the concept that price movements behave in the

investors to separate the processes of selecting and timing investments—
that is, to select the investment, but then wait for it to experience a
period of below-average performance before investing their funds. Any

Guazzoni's family emigrated from Italy when he was sixteen. Both his
parents are nuclear physicists (his mother was also an Olympic skier)
who were recruited by the U.S. Department of Defense as part of a clas-
sified cold war program, which Guazzoni explained was designed to har-
bor noteworthy European scientists in the United States, a very safe
distance from the Soviet Union's reach. Guazzoni, however, speaks Eng-
lish without any trace of an accent. He also speaks five other languages
fluently.

We compete with banks all the time, but there are many reasons why
companies come to us. Sometimes a bank may be willing to give a
company a partial loan but want them to raise an equity cushion else-

Three years, and then I transferred to Salomon's merger and acquisi-
tion department in NYC.
Why did you leave the bond department?
The focus was very narrow. I wanted to learn more about companies

and industries. At the time, a lot of people were
in the realm of leveraged buyouts,
that side of business. I was eventually hired by an LBO firm, run by a
client of Salomon who had his own company that did leveraged buy-
outs.
Exactly how does a leveraged buyout work?
At certain times, some companies may be trading well below their
replacement value. In other words, the assets of the company are
worth more than its aggregate share price.
? n e t f o y r e v n e p p a h t a h t s e o D
Well it happened frequently in the early-to-mid-1980s. Usually the
companies involved were very boring—for example, a company that
made steel shelving and had made steel shelving for the past fifty
years. The basic idea was that a loan could be obtained against the
company's cash flow. Let's say the company's cash flow was $10 mil-
lion a year. Based on that cash flow, you could get a loan that required
y- n a of n a o l al ot t a g n yi pl m i nt, e m y a p a $7 million annual interest
where between $90 to 100 million at the prevailing interest rate of
the time.
So the basic plan was to repay the loan from the company's
cash flow.
Yes, but then you had to run the company correctly. Once you had

money.
I was particularly attracted to the concept of buying undervalued
assets, which I became aware was not something that was confined to

just leveraged buyouts. Every period of time has its own opportunities
where one can find investments that are extremely discounted and
have a very well protected downside.
At Salomon Brothers, I had gotten to know Lewis Ranieri, who
left before I did. Ranieri taught me there is no reason to buy things at
retail. Anything sold out there you can buy at half price. Everything,
everything out there. Besides the hype and fancy shopping bag, what
is the reason for buying something at a Madison Avenue boutique?
The money. m your There is none. It's just a trick to separate you fro
same thing is true in the stock market. Why would people buy Inter-

their money. At the time, Ranieri was heavily involved in buying

How was the downside protected?
When you are bidding 10 or 20 on a loan portfolio that supposedly
had a value of 100 just twelve months prior, it's hard to go very far
wrong, although it was possible to lose money if you bought a portfo-
lio constructed by fools or crooks, which sometimes was the case.
Did you get involved in buying RTC loans?
No. I spent a lot of time looking into it while I was at that LBO firm, but
to my disillusionment, nothing ever came of it. That was part of the rea-
son why I left to go off on my own. Besides being severely undercom-
pensated, 1 was frustrated by having identified a number of

believed to be limited risk, and yet nothing was ever allowed to be clone.
By the time I left the LBO firm, it was too late to start bidding for
RTC loans, because they had attracted too much interest, and the
winning bids were 60 cents, 70 cents, or 80 cents on the dollar,
instead of the original 10 or 20 cents. The profit opportunities with
low risk were gone. Also, I didn't have enough funds to participate in

What other strategies did you come up with?
At the time, there were many CEOs who owned a lortune in their
own company stock, but who could not sell any part of their holdings
on the open market due to restrictions. I thought I could buy it pri-
vately for 50 cents on the dollar.
Why couldn't they sell their stock?
Because their company had just done an initial public offering (IPO)
and the stock was restricted [senior management and board members

specified period]. Purchasing restricted stock privately at a discount
represented another form of the same idea that so attracted me—buy-
ing an asset for a lot less than what I perceived the true value to be.
Because it was a private transaction, and I took on the restriction. I
couldn't sell the stock until the restriction period was over. I could go

$2 million of restricted stock." Remember, restrictions back then
were as long as three years.
How did you find managers who wanted to sell restricted stock at

Management and other insiders have to file SEC forms every year
showing ownership. 1 periodically searched through these filings.
Then I would call a manager and make a proposal to him: "I see that
you own 50 percent of your company. Would you be interested in
cashing out on a small part of it?" Some of them would be.
I assume many of them would say yes but then would lose their
enthusiasm once you told them that you were offering them only

Well, maybe you might be very happy to trade $2 million of stock that
you can't sell for three years for $1 million in hand.
How did you get the money to buy the stock?

Statistical arbitrage expands the classic arbitrage concept of simulta-
neously buying and selling identical financial instruments for a locked-in
profit to encompass buying and selling closely related financial instru-
ments for a probable profit. In statistical arbitrage, each individual trade
is no longer a sure thing, but the odds imply an edge. The trader engaged
in statistical arbitrage will lose on a significant percentage of trades but
will be profitable over the long run, assuming trade probabilities and

prime strategies used by the Morgan Stanley trading group, for which
Shaw worked before he left to form his own firm.
Pairs trading involves a two-step process. First, past data are used to
define pairs of stocks that tend to move together. Second, each of these
pairs is monitored for performance divergences. Whenever there is a sta-
tistically meaningful performance divergence between two stocks in a
defined pair, the stronger of the pair is sold and the weaker is bought.
The basic assumption is that the performance of these closely related
stocks will tend to converge. Insofar as this theory is correct, a pairs trad-

Shaw's entrepreneurial bent emerged at an early age. When he was

formed a company that manufactured and sold psychedelic ties. He
bought three sewing machines and hired high school students to manu-
facture the ties. The venture failed because he hadn't given much

inefficient way to market the ties.
His first serious business venture, however, was a success. While he
was at graduate school at Stanford, he took two years off to start a com-
puter company that developed compilers [computer code that translates
programs written in user languages into machine language instructions].
Although this venture was very profitable, Shaw's graduate school
adviser convinced him that it was not realistic for him to earn his Ph.D.
part-time while running a company. Shaw sold the company and com-
pleted his Ph.D. work at Stanford. He never considered the alternative
of staying with his entrepreneurial success and abandoning his immedi-
ate goal of getting a Ph.D. "Finishing graduate school was extremely
important to me at the time," he says. "To be taken seriously in the
computer research community, you pretty much had to be a faculty
member at a top university or a Ph.D.-level scientist at a leading
research lab."
Shaw's doctoral dissertation, "Knowledge Based Retrieval on a Rela-
tional Database Machine," provided the theoretical basis for building
massively parallel computers. One of the pivotal theorems in Shaw's dis-
sertation proved that, for an important class of problems, the theoretical
advantage of a multiple processor computer over a single processor com-
puter would increase in proportion to the magnitude of the problem. The
implications of this theorem for computer architecture were momentous:
It demonstrated the inevitability of parallel processor design vis-a-vis sin-

ness, Shaw's firm has also incubated and spun off a number of other
companies. Perhaps the best-known of these is Juno Online Services, the
world's second-largest provider of dial-up Internet sendees (after America
Online). Juno was launched as a public company in May 1999 and is
traded on Nasdaq (symbol: JWEB). D. E. Shaw also developed DESoFT,
a financial technology company, which was sold to Merrill Lynch, an
acquisition that was pivotal to the brokerage firm's rollout of an on-line
trading service. FarSight, an on-line brokerage firm, and D. E. Shaw
Financial Products, a market-making operation, were other businesses
developed at D. E. Shaw and subsequently sold.
In addition to spawning a slew of successful companies, D. E. Shaw
also has provided venture capital funding to Schrodinger Inc. (for which

From the time I was in college, I was fascinated by the question of
what human thought was—what made it different from a computer.
When I was a graduate student at Stanford, I started thinking about

working in parallel instead of a single very fast processor.
Were there any other people working to develop parallel super-
computers at that time?

these sorts of "fine-graine time—for m- xa e

At the time, one of the main constraints on computer speed was a
limitation often referred to as the "von Neumann bottleneck." The
E G D E E V I T A T I T N A U Q
traditional von Neumann machine, named after John von Neumann,
has a single central processing unit (CPU) connected to a single

Yes, at least on a small scale. After I finished my Ph.D., I was
appointed to the faculty of the department of computer science at
Columbia University. I was fortunate enough to receive a multi-
Research Advanced A [the RP A m million-dollar research contract fro
THE QUANTITATIVE
Projects Agency of the U.S. Department of Defense, which is best
known for building the ARPAnet, the precursor of the Internet]. This
funding allowed me to organize a team of thirty-five people to design
of this working prototype mized integrated circuits and build a custo
sort of massively parallel machine. It was a fairly small version, but it
did allow us to test out our ideas and collect the data we needed to
calculate the theoretically achievable speed of a full-scale supercom-
puter based on the same architectural principles.

DAVID SHAW THE QUANTITAT1I
Up to that point, had you given any thought to a career in the
financial markets?
None whatsoever.
I had read that your stepfather was a financial economist who
first introduced you to the efficient market hypothesis.* Did that
bias you as to the feasibility of developing strategies that could
beat the market? Also, given your own lengthy track record, does
your stepfather still believe in the efficient market hypothesis?
Although o t e m e os p x e o t e n o st fir e h t as w er h at pf e st y m at h t e u tr it's
the idea that most, if not all, publicly available information about a
given company is already reflected in its current market price, I'm
not sure that he ever believed it was impossible to beat the market.
The things I learned from him probably led me to be more skeptical
than most people about the existence of a "free lunch" in the stock
market, but he never claimed that the absence of evidence refuting
the efficient market hypothesis proved that the markets are, in fact,
efficient.

can ever demonstrate is that the specific patterns being tested do
not exist. You can never prove that there aren't any patterns that
could beat the market.
That's exactly right. All that being said, I grew up with the idea that, if
not impossible, it was certainly extremely difficult to beat the market.
And even now, I find it remarkable how efficient the markets actually
mally would be nice if all you had to do in order to earn abnor are. It
large returns was to identify some sort of standard pattern in the his-
torical prices of a given stock. But most of the claims that are made by
so-called technical analysts, involving constructs like support and
resistance levels and head-and-shoulders patterns, have absolutely no
grounding in methodologically sound empirical research.
But isn't it possible that many of these patterns can't be rigor-
There are three variations of this theory: (1) weak form—past prices cannot be used lo
predict future prices; (2) semistrong form—the current price reflects all publicly
known information; (3) strong form—the current price reflects all information,

terns, theoretically, there could be an infinite number of possible
definitions.
Yes, that's an excellent point. But the inability to precisely explicate
the hypothesis being tested is one of the signposts of a pseudo-
science. Even for those patterns where it's been possible to come up
with a reasonable consensus definition for the sorts of patterns tradi-

predictive value. The interesting thing is that even some of the most

dence they're doing anything more useful than astrology.
But wait a minute. I've interviewed quite a number of traders
who are purely technically oriented and have achieved return-to-
risk results that were well beyond the realm of chance.
I think it depends on your definition of technical analysis. Histori-
cally, most of the people who have used that term have been members

Why would anyone who trades the markets publish something
? s k r o w t a h t
That's a very good question. For various reasons, the vast majority of the
work that appears in the open literature can't be used in high-quality
practice to actually beat the market. Conversely, the vast majority of the
research that really does work will probably never be published. But
there are a few successful quantitative traders who from time to time
publish useful information, even when it may not be in their own self-
interest to do so. My favorite example is Ed Thorpe, who was a real pio-
neer in the field. He was doing this stuff well before almost anyone else.

became more effective at expelling them from the casinos.
I know that classic arbitrage opportunities are long gone. Did
such sitting-duck trades, however, exist when you first started?
Even then, those sorts of true arbitrage opportunities were few and
far between. Every once in a while, we were able to engage in a
small set of transactions in closely related instruments that, taken
together, locked in a risk-free or nearly risk-free profit. Occasionally,
we'd even find it possible to execute each component of a given arbi-

What gives you that edge?
It's a subtle effect. A single inefficiency may not be sufficient to over-
come transaction costs. When multiple inefficiencies happen to coin-

statistically expected profit that exceeds the associated transaction
costs. Other things being equal, the more inefficiencies you can iden-
tify, the more trading opportunities you're likely to have.
How could the use of multiple strategies, none of which independently
yields a profit, be profitable? As a simple illustration, imagine that there
are two strategies, each of which has an expected gain of $100 and a
transaction cost of $110. Neither of these strategies could be applied

itself. Of course, for Shaw's company, which trades scores of strategies in
many related markets, the effect of strategy interdependencies is tremen-
dously more complex.

Although we use a number of different mathematical techniques
one of our strategies, value predictive and to establish the robustness
of our most powerful tools is the straightforward application of the
scientific method. Rather than blindly searching through the data for
patterns—an approach whose methodological dangers are widely

research communities—we typically start by formulating a hypothesis
based on some sort of structural theory or qualitative understanding
of the market, and then test that hypothesis to see whether it is sup-
ported by the data.
Unfortunately, the most common outcome is that the actual data
fail to provide evidence that would allow us to reject the "null hypoth-
esis" of market efficiency. Every once in a while, though, we do find a
new market anomaly that passes all our tests, and which we wind up
incorporating in an actual trading strategy.

there could have been much of a problem. What happened?
The performance results you're referring to are for our equity and
equity-linked trading strategies, which have formed the core of our
proprietary trading activities since our start over eleven years ago. For
a few years, though, we also traded a fixed income strategy. That
strategy was qualitatively different from the equity-related strategies
we'd historically employed and exposed us to fundamentally different
sorts of risks. Although we initially made a lot of money on our fixed
income trading, we experienced significant losses during the global
liquidity crisis in late 1998, as was the case for most fixed income
arbitrage traders during that period. While our losses were much
uf- ose s h n t a h ms, t er dollar t
were
smaller, in both percentage and absolute
fered by, for example, Long Term Capital Management, they
significant enough that we're no longer engaged in this sort of trading
at all.

should at least spend some time with him." I met with Jeff and was

instincts. I told my partner that he was right and that even though we

he wanted to pursue this idea on his own.

having made a similar decision myself at one point, I'd understand
completely if he decided the time had come to strike out on his own
and would not try to talk him out of it. I assured him that given the
relatively short period of time we'd been talking about the electronic
bookstore concept, I'd have no objections whatsoever if he decided
that he wanted to pursue this idea on his own. I told him that we
might or might not decide to compete with him at some point, and he
said that seemed perfectly fair to him.
Jeff's departure was completely amicable, and when he finished

ers at D. E. Shaw to test it. It wasn't until I used this alpha version to
order my first book that I realized how powerful this concept could
really be. Although we'd talked about the idea of an electronic book-
store while Jeff was still at D. E. Shaw, it's the things Jeff did since
leaving that made Amazon what it is today.
Shaw's trading approach, which requires highly complex mathe-
matical models, vast computer power, constant monitoring of world-
wide markets by a staff of traders, and near instantaneous, extreme
low-cost trade executions, is clearly out of the reach of the ordinary
investor. One concept that came up in this interview, however, that
could have applicability to the individual investor is the idea that
market patterns ("inefficiencies" in Shaw's terminology) that are not
profitable on their own might still provide the basis for a profitable
strategy when combined with other patterns. Although Shaw dis-
dains chart patterns and traditional technical indicators, an analo-
gous idea would apply: It is theoretically possible that a combination



==================================================
                     PAGE 145                     
==================================================

of patterns (or indicators) could yield a useful trading model, even if
the individual elements are worthless when used alone.
This synergistic effect would apply to fundamental inputs as well.
For example, a researcher might test ten different fundamental fac-
tors and find that none are worthwhile as price indicators. Does this
imply that these fundamental inputs should be dismissed as useless?
Absolutely not. Even though no single factor provides a meaningful
predictor, it is entirely possible that some combination of these
inputs could yield a useful price indicator.
Another important principle that came up in this interview con-
cerns the appropriate methodology in testing trading ideas. A trader
trying to develop a systematic approach, or any approach that incorpo-
rates computer patterns as signals, should caution against data min-
ing—letting the computer cycle through the data, testing thousands

such computational profligacy has a more critical cost: it will tend to
generate trading models (systems) that look great, but have no predic-
tive power—a combination that could lead to large trading losses.
Because patterns can be found even in random data. For Why?
example, if you flipped one million coins ten times apiece, on aver-
age, about 977 of those coins would land on heads all ten times.
Obviously, it would be foolish to assume that these coins are more
likely to land on heads in the future. But this type of naive reasoning
is precisely what some system developers do when they test huge

If you test enough variations of
any chance—just
as some coins will land on heads on every toss if you flip enough
coins. Shaw avoids this problem of data mining by requiring that a
theoretical hypothesis precede each computer test and by using rig-
orous statistical measures to evaluate the significance of the results.

Cohen's name was mentioned by industry acquaintances. When I looked
at Cohen's numbers, I understood the reason for their ebullient praise. In
the seven years he has managed money, Cohen has averaged a com-
pounded annual return of 45 percent, with only three losing months in
the entire period—the worst a tiny 2 percent decline.
These numbers, however, dramatically understate Cohen's trading
talent. Cohen is so good that he is able to charge a 50 percent profit
incentive fee, which means that his actual trading profits have averaged
approximately 90 percent per year. Despite stratospheric fees—approxi-
mately two and a half times the hedge fund industry average—Cohen
has not had a problem attracting investors. In fact, his flagship fund is
closed to new investment.

When I arrived, Cohen was in the midst of a lengthy phone conver-

referring to the dual interviews.) I squeezed a chair in alongside Cohen's

on the quote screens in front of him. At one point, he interrupted his
conversation to call out an order. "Sell 20 [20,000] Pokemon." As an
aside to the rest of the room, he said, "My kids love it, but what the

of activity and an accompanying wave of increased noise. Traders contin-

was placing an order for a tuna fish on rye, instead of buying or selling
25,000 to 100,000 shares at a clip.

They taught you that 40 percent of a stock's price movement was due

XVZ had a subsidiary, which had an Internet Web site for financial

started to run up in front of the scheduled offering, rallying to $13,

A basic principle in going short is that there has to be a catalyst. Flere,
the catalyst was the offering. The offering was on Friday, and I started
going short on Tuesday, so that I would be fully positioned by that
time. If the offering took place, and the stock didn't go down, then I
probably would have covered. What had made me so angry was that I
had sold out my original position.
So you got redemption.

Watching Steve Cohen, you are left with the unmistakable impres-
s i h T . d e d a e h s i t e k r a m e h t e r e h w f o e s n e s l a e r a s a h e h t a h t n o i s
sense, or gut feel, is nothing more that a distillation of the experi-
ences and lessons drawn from tens of thousands of trades. It is the
. r e t u p m o c n a m u h a s a r e d a r t
So-called gut feel is a combination of experience and talent. It
cannot be taught. Novice traders cannot expect to have gut feel, and
experienced traders may also not possess it. Even many of the Mar-
ket Wizards don't possess gut feel; in many cases, their trading suc-
cess is due to a different talent—for example, a skill for market
g. n di uil b m e st y s or s si y al n a
Although Steve Cohen's trading style cannot be emulated, his
trading disciplines can. Insofar as Cohen's behavior demonstrates
some of the key attributes of the successful trader, the accounts of
his trading experiences contain important information even for the
beginning trader. For example, Cohen provides an excellent model of
the expert trader's approach to risk control.
s e k a t s i m s e k a m n e h o C s, i e h s a d o o g s A too—sometimes g i b
ones. Consider the trade in which he shorted IBM before an earn-
ings report. He was dead wrong on his expectations, and the stock
release. Since his reason lor placing the trade had been violated,
Cohen covered his position immediately. He didn't try to rationalize
gapped up $18 against him in the first trades after the report's

he took a sizable loss, had he waited just until the next morning, the
stock would have gone another $[() against him. All traders make
mistakes; the great traders, however, limit the damage.
For Cohen, cutting losses is almost a re Hex action. Although
developing such loss control skills usually takes many years of experi-
ence, n e h o C offers f o e c e i p e n o related t a h t e c i v d a should - e s u s a e b
ful to the novice as to the professional: "If you think you're wrong, or
if the market is moving against you and you don't know why, take in
half. " . n i a g a n o t i t u p s y a w l a n a c u Yo
Another important lesson provided by Cohen is that it is critical
that your style of trading match your personality. There is no single
right way to trade the markets. Know who you are. For example,
don't try to be both an investor and a day trader. Choose an approach
that is comfortable for you.
Cohen also advises that it is important to make sure you have a
good reason for pulling on a trade. Buying a stock because it is "too
low" or selling it because il is "too high" is not a good reason. If that
is the extent of your analysis, there is no reason why you should
expect to win in the markets.
Being a great trader is a process, ft's a race with no finish line.
'Hit- markets are not static. No single style or approach can provide
superior results over long periods of time. To continue to outper-
form, the great traders continue to learn and adapt. Cohen con-
stantly tries to learn more about the markets—to expand his
expertise to encompass additional stocks, sectors, and styles of trad-
ing. As Cohen explains, trading for him is an evolutionary process.

you pay attention to his advice? Because Steve Cohen, who is unques-
tionably one of the world's greatest traders (sec interview in this book),
thinks enough of Doctor Kiev to have made him a permanent fixture at
his firm, S.A.C. Doctor Kiev began working with traders at S.A.C. in
1992, conducting weekly seminars. This role steadily expanded over the
years, and he now spends three full days each week at S.A.C, working
with traders both individually and within groups. He also consults with a
small number of professional traders at other firms.
Doctor Kiev graduated Harvard and received his medical degree at
Cornell. After a residency at Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Maudsley
Hospital in London and serving as a research associate at Columbia, he
returned to Cornell Medical College to head their social psychiatry
department, focusing on suicide prevention research. In 1970, he
founded the Social Psychiatry Research Institute, which participated in
major trials as h c u s gs, u dr nt a s s e pr e d nti a e h of t Pro?.ac, Paxil, Zoloft, d n a
Celexa, among others.
Doctor Kiev was the first psychiatrist appointed to the U.S. Olympic
Sports Medicine Committee and worked with Olympic athletes during
1977—82. It er- p eir h e t c n a h n e s e et hl at c pi m y Ol g n pi el h n k i or w s hi s a w

One of the therapies for depressed and suicidal patients is to help
them become more sell-reliant and assertive. These same skills are
applicable to athletes and traders as well.
How did you get involved in working with Olympic athletes?
My kids went to a health club that was run by the head of the U.S.
Olympic Sports Medicine Committee, and I met some Olympic ath-
letes there. As a result of that association, 1 became the first psychia-

What sports did the athletes you worked with participate in?
Bobsledcling—my son was on the U.S. world team in 1981—basket-
ball, archery, fencing, kayaking, sculling, and a number of others.
That's quite a range of sports. Are there common denominators
among the sports or are different approaches required for differ-
ent types of athletes?
There are some common denominators, but different sports require
different mental frameworks. For example, in bobsledding, you need
to start off with a maximum amount oi exertion as you run and push
wn w do the sled. But as soon as you get into the sled, you have to slo
your adrenaline so that you are calm and centered while steering the
sled down the course. A similar transition is required in the biathlon,
with their heart rate where the athletes race on cross-country skis,
exceeding 120 beats per minute, and then have to stop and focus on
shooting a target, with their heartbeat ideally slowing clown to 40
mselves These types of athletes can condition the minute. beats per
by practicing abrupt mental shifts between exertion and relaxation.

In any sport, it's very difficult to win a gold medal unless you decide
you're going to win it. Making the Olympic team and winning a gold
medal may be a ten-year quest. If you're going to make it, then you
have to start today to do those things that are compatible

What are the implications of setting a target and then not reach-
ing it? Certainly not everyone who sets a higher target makes it.
The objective of setting a target is not necessarily to reach it, but
m- measure your perfor which to rather to establish a standard against
ance. If you are not reaching your target, it forces you to focus on
what you are doing wrong or what you may not be doing that you
should. The target holds you to a higher standard of performance.

can't sustain the effort. When someone achieves his goal, the ques-
tion is often, "What now?" My answer, which is based on comparing
athletes who have won gold medals with those who haven't, is to set
up another target that will provide a challenge. The gold medal win-
ners are always stretching for a goal that is uncertain.
Failing to redefine the goal can limit success. For example, one ski
jumper prepared for the Olympic trials for years by visualizing himself
e h t e d a m , s l a i r t e h t o t e m a c e H . r e v o d n a r e v o s p m u j t c e f r e doing p

problem was that the qualifying jumps ended up being his best per-

for going beyond the trials.
Some traders have trouble maintaining the discipline that made
them successful once they get ahead by a certain amount. One trader I
worked with did well at the beginning of each month, but whenever he
got ahead by $300,000, he would revert to bad habits. When I pressed

thing I noticed about Steve that I've also seen in a number of
other great traders is that he can look at the same one hundred
facts everyone else sees—some me of bullish and so which are of
which are bearish—and somehow pick out the one or two ele-
ments that are most relevant to the market at that moment in
time.
You saw that? I think part of it is preparation and part of it is experi-
ence. The trades he's doing are not new trades. He has a vast reper-
toire of trades and is able to access them. Great traders like Steve are
also able to notice when the sweet spot is visible and to pile in.
According to S.A.C.'s risk manager's statistics, 5 percent of his trades
account for virtually all of his profits. He is also willing to cut his posi-
tion when he is wrong.

Just professional traders. I see myself as a trading coach—helping
someone who is a trader improve, not teaching someone who is not a
trader to be a trader. My job is to diagnose how a trader might be
help and then market motional response to the wn e o his by trapped
tweak his approach to correct the problem.
For example.
One trader came to me and said, "When I'm winning, I keep win-
ning—I can do no wrong; when I'm losing, I keep losing—I can't do
anything right." The solution was to create the same state of mind
when he was losing as when he was winning.
How do you do that?
By getting him to re-create the same mind-set that he has on a win-
ning streak. When he is on a winning streak, he is fearless, intuitive,

when he comes into the office, he has the same attitude toward his
trading as when he is in the middle of a winning streak. You repeat-

Every time he attempted the third turn, he would lali. I asked him if
he could begin to do it in his mind. At first, when he attempted
doing it in his mind, he would also fall, i had him keep practicing
the jump in his mind until he felt comlortable doing it mentally. In
order to be able to do it physically on the ice, he had to first have a
mental image of his doing the jump successfully. Not long alter he

his mind hundreds of times. This mental imaging allowed him to
overcome his anxiety, and he was ultimately able to make the turn
without overcompensating.
I don't want to make this sound simple or magical. 1 don't mean to
suggest that all that is involved is learning some set ol visualization
techniques. What I do is better described as a dialogue process to
find out what is impeding a person's performance.
Do people know the answer to that question?
They frequently do. I worked with one trader who whenever he

On balance, these remnant positions were costing him money. He
had to learn when he decided to get rid of his entire position it was
time to liquidate, which at first was anxiety producing.

Define a target, a strategy consistent with the target, a set of disci-

Successful traders invariably gravitate to an approach that fits their per-
sonality. For example, Cook is happy to take a small profit on a trade but
hates to take even a small loss. Given this predisposition, the methodolo-
gies he has developed, which accept a low return/risk ratio on each trade in
exchange for a high probability of winning, are right for him. These same
methods, however, could be a mismatch for others. Trading is not a one-
size-fits-all proposition; each trader must tailor an individual approach.
4. Failure and Perseverance
Although some of the traders in this book were successful from the start,
the early market experiences of others were marked by complete failure.

Walton, for example, started out by selling powerhouse stocks and
buying bargain stocks. When his empirical observations of what actually
worked in the market contradicted this original inclination, he was flexi-

opposite of the methodology he ended up using.
Markets are dynamic. Approaches that work in one period may cease
to work in another. Success in the markets requires the ability to adapt to
changing conditions and altered realities. Some examples:

Diversification. The more diversified the holdings, the lower the

too much diversification can have significant drawbacks.
Short selling. Although the common perception is that short selling
is risky, it can actually be an effective tool for reducing portfolio risk (see
item 59).
Hedged Strategies. Some traders (Fletcher, Guazzoni, Shaw, and
Bender) use methodologies in which positions are hedged from the
matter of restricting leverage, For these traders, risk control is a onset.
since even a low-risk strategy can become a high-risk trade if the leverage
is excessive. (See, for example, discussion of LTCM in the Shaw inter-
view.)
16. You Can't Be Afraid of Risk
Risk control should not be confused with fear of risk. A willingness to
accept risk is probably an essential personality trait for a trader. As Wat-
son states, "You have to be willing to accept a certain level of risk, or else
you will never pull the trigger." When asked what he looks for when he

17. Limiting the Downside by Focusing on Undervalued Stocks
A number of the traders interviewed restrict their stock selection to the
universe of undervalued securities. Watson focuses on the stocks with
relatively low price/earnings ratios (8 to 12). Lauer will look for stocks
market-adjusted declines of at least 50 percent. witnessed that have
Okumus buys stocks that have declined 60 percent or more off their
highs and are trading at price/earnings ratios under 12. He also prefers to
buy stocks with prices as close as possible to book value.
One reason all these traders focus on buying stocks that meet their
definition of value is that by doing so they limit the downside. As Lauer
explains when talking about using a large price decline as a selection

I don't lose money. I'm not talking about making money yet." Another
advantage of buying stocks that are trading at depressed levels is that the
stocks in this group that do turn around will often have tremendous
upside potential.

Believing in a goal, however, is not sufficient. To achieve a goal, Kiev
says, you need not only to believe in it, but also to commit to it. Promis-

29. Never, Ever Listen to Other Opinions
To succeed in the markets, it is essential to make your own decisions.
Numerous traders cited listening to others as their worst blunder. Walton
and Minervini lost their entire investment stake because of this misjudg-

been surrendering the decision-making responsibility to someone else."

trading success and make the appropriate adjustments. For example,
Walton ultimately realized his weakness was listening to other people's
opinions. His awareness of this personal flaw compelled him to make
sure that he worked alone, even when the level of assets under manage-
ment would have seemed to dictate the need for a staff. In addition, to
safely vent his tip-following, gambling urges, he set aside a small
amount of capital—too small to do any damage—to be used for such
trades.
Doctor Kiev describes his work with traders as "a dialogue process to
find out what [personal flaws are] impeding a person's performance."
Some examples of these personal flaws he helped traders identify
included:
*• a trader whose bargain-hunting predisposition caused him to miss

Ironically, although many people are drawn to the markets for excite-
ment, the Market Wizards frequently cite keeping emotion out of trad-
ing as essential advice to investors. Watson says, "You have to invest
without emotions. If you let emotions get involved, you will make bad
decisions."

stop trading altogether at the first sign of trouble.

Minervini higher if been substantially have would his returns found that
he had capped his losses to a fixed maximum level. This discovery
prompted a change in his trading rules that dramatically improved his
performance.
Stupid Looking About Worry Don't 35.
Never let your market decisions be restricted or influenced by concern
over what others might think. As a perfect example of the danger of wor-
rying about other people's opinions, early in his career, Minervini held on
to many losing positions long after he decided they should be liquidated
because of concern about being teased by his broker.
36. The Danger of Leverage
Lauer learned his lesson about leverage during the October 1987 crash.
The problem was not the crash or his stock selection methodology, as his
portfolio recovered in due time, but rather his use of leverage, which
resulted in a margin call, forcing premature liquidation of his positions.
Therefore Lauer's use of leverage (full margin) didn't merely double his
loss on the initial decline, but more importantly prevented him from par-
ticipating in the subsequent recovery.
WIZARD LESSONS
Ironically, even though Mark Cook won on most of his trades in his
initial market endeavor, he wiped out because of excessive leverage. If
you are too heavily leveraged, all it takes is one mistake to knock you out
of the game.
37. The Importance of Position Size
Superior performance requires not only picking the right stock, but also
having the conviction to implement major potential trades in meaningful
size. Doctor Kiev, who sees Cohen's trading statistics, said that nearly
100 percent of Cohen's very substantial gains come from 5 percent of his
trades. Cohen himself estimates that perhaps only about 55 percent of
n e h o C n e h w at h t s i s nt e m e at st e s e h t n i cit pli m I s. r e n n wi e r a s e d a r t s hi
bets big, he is usually right. Indeed, his uncanny skill in determining
which trades warrant stepping on the accelerator is an essential element
in his success.
Lauer makes a similar point when he says, "I tell my guys that if we
0 0 0 0, 0 1 or 0 0 0 0, 5 y u b y nl o e w m fir a as d n a a, e d d i o o g a h wit p u e m o c

larly high likelihood of winning. Interestingly, he has never lost money on
any one of these trades.
The point is that all trades are not the same. Trades that are perceived
to have particularly favorable potential relative to risk or a particularly

individual, but the concept is as applicable to the trader whose average
position size is one hundred shares as it is to the fund manager whose
average position size is one million shares.

ready to blast off are usually very difficult to buy without pushing the mar-

"waitfing] to buy these stocks on a pullback, which never comes."
46. Don't Let a Prior Lower-Priced Liquidation Keep You from Purchasing a
Stock That You Would Have Bought Otherwise
Walton considers his willingness to buy back good stocks, even when

53. The Argument Against Diversification
al nt e m u r st n i n a s i it e s u a c e b e u rt vi a s a d e oll xt e n e oft s i n o ati Diversific
tool in reducing risk. This argument is valid insofar as it is generally
unwise to risk all your assets on one or two equities, as opposed to
spreading the investment across a broader number of diversified stocks.
Beyond a certain minimum level, however, diversification may some-
times have negative consequences.
Lauer makes two arguments against diversification. First, if carried
far enough, it will guarantee indexlike performance. Therefore, if a
trader's goal is to significantly surpass index performance, then diversifi-
cation should be limited. Second, Lauer points out that in order to be
able to make money in both up and down markets, it is necessary for a

limiting the number of stocks held. Okumus, another antidiversification
proponent, explains as follows why he limits his portfolio to approxi-
mately ten holdings: "Simple logic: My top ten ideas will always perform
better than my top hundred."
The foregoing is not intended as an argument against diversification.
Indeed, some minimal diversification is almost always desirable. The

55. Synergy and Marginal Indicators
Shaw mentioned that although the individual market inefficiencies his
firm has identified cannot be traded profitably on their own, they can be
combined to identify profit opportunities. The general implication is that
it is possible for technical or fundamental indicators that are marginal on
their own to provide the basis for a much more reliable indicator when
combined.

Expected to Prevail
It is important to understand why an investment (stock or fund) outper-
formed in the past. For example, as Lauer pointed out, in the late 1990s
a number of the better performing funds owed their superior results to a
strategy of buying the most highly capitalized stocks. As a result, the
high-cap stocks were bid up to extremely high price/earnings ratios rela-
tive to the rest of the market. A new investor expecting these funds to

more overpriced relative to the rest of the market.

its characteristic folly, but the basic cause is the same: people persist in
believing that what has happened in the recent past will go on happening

57. Popularity Can Destroy a Sound Approach
A classic example of this principle was provided by the 1980s experience
with portfolio insurance (the systematic sale of stock index futures as the
value of a stock portfolio declines in order to reduce risk exposure). In
the early years of its implementation, portfolio insurance provided a rea-
t e k r a m f o t n e v e e h t n i s e s s o l t i m i l o t s r o t s e v n i r o f y g e t a r t s e l b a n o s
declines. As the strategy became more popular, however, it set the stage
for its own destruction. By the time of the October 1987 crash, portfolio
insurance was in wide usage, which contributed to the domino effect of
price declines triggering portfolio insurance selling, which pushed prices
be on. It can even and so portfolio selling, more causing still lower,
WIZARD LESSONS
argued that the mere knowledge of the existence of large portfolio insur-
ance sell orders below the market was one of the reasons for the enor-
mous magnitude of the October 19, 1987, decline.
Index funds may well provide a current example of this principle. As
Lauer explained, index funds originally made a lot of sense for the
investor, providing the opportunity to own a representative piece of the
market, with presumably lower risk due to the index's diversification, and
a low cost structure and favorable tax treatment (due to low turnover). As
index funds outperformed the majority of actively managed funds, how-
ever, they attracted steadily expanding investment flows. This investment
shift, in turn, created more buying for the stocks in the index at the
expense of the rest of the market, which helped the index funds outper-
form the vast majority of individual stocks, attracting still more assets,
and so on. As a result of this process, what started out as a conservative

at high valuations and therefore embedding above-average risk.
Of course, it is impossible to know whether this situation will correct
itself by the time this book is published. But if index stocks are still trad-

ket at that time, then the same cautionary message would apply.
58. Like a Coin, the Market Has Two Sides—but the Coin Is Unfair
Just as you can bet heads or tails on a coin, you can go long or short a
stock. Unlike a normal coin, however, the odds for each side are not
equal: The long-term uptrend in stock prices results in a strong negative
bias in short-selling trades. As Lescarbeau says, "Shorting stocks is dumb
because the odds are stacked against you. The stock market has been ris-

go against that trend?" (Actually, there is a good reason why, which we will
get to shortly.)
Another disadvantage to the short side is that the upside is capped.
Whereas a well-chosen buy could result in hundreds or even thousands

a profit of 100 percent (if the stock goes to zero). Conversely, whereas a
long position can't lose more than 100 percent (assuming no use of mar-
gin), the loss on a short position is theoretically unlimited.

Finally, with the exception of index products, the system is stacked
against short selling. The short seller has to borrow the stock to sell it,
n i d e l l a c g n i e b k c o t s d e w o r r o b e h t f o
to
an action that introduces the risk
at a future date, forcing the trader to cover (buy in) the position. Fre-
quently, deliberate attempts to force shorts to cover their positions
(short squeezes) can cause overvalued, and even worthless, stocks
rally sharply before collapsing. Thus, the short seller faces the real risk
of being right on the trade and still losing money because of an artifi-

from its last sale price)—a rule that can cause a trade to be executed at
a much worse price that the prevailing market price when the order was
entered.
59. The Why of Short Selling
With all the disadvantages of short selling, it would appear reasonable to
conclude that it is foolhardy to ever go short. Reasonable, but wrong. As

short selling.

As these examples make clear, it takes only one bad mistake to wipe
out an account on the short side. Because of the theoretically unlimited
risk in short positions, the one essential rule for short selling is: Define a
specific plan for limiting losses and rigorously adhere to it.
The following are some of the risk-control methods for short positions
mentioned by the interviewed traders:
> A short position is liquidated when it reaches a predetermined
m loss point, even mu maxi if the trader's bearish mpletely analysis is co
unchanged. As Watson says, "I will cover even if I am convinced
that the company will ultimately go bankrupt. ... I'm not going to
let [a one-percent short in the portfolio] turn into a 5 percent loss."
> A short position is limited to a specific maximum percentage of the
portfolio. Therefore, as the price of a short position rises, the size of

A number of traders mentioned the tendency for Wall Street research
reports to be biased. Watson suggests the bias is a result of investment
banking relationships—analysts will typically feel implicit pressure to
issue buy ratings on companies that are clients of the firm, even if they
don't particularly like the stock. Lauer, who was himself an analyst for
many years, pointed out the pressure on analysts to issue recommenda-

Options—Understanding
the Basics
There are two basic types of options: calls and puts. The purchase of a call
option provides the buyer with the right—but not the obligation—to pur-
chase the underlying stock (or other financial instrument) at a specified
price, called the strike price or exercise price, at any time up to and
including the expiration date. A put option provides the buyer with the
right—but not the obligation—to sell the underlying stock at the strike
price at any time prior to expiration. (Note, therefore, that buying a put is
a bearish a ut is p a g n elli s hereas w de, tra bullish n a of price he T e.) d a tr

share at any time during the life of the option.
The buyer of a call seeks to profit from an anticipated price rise by
locking in a specified purchase price. The call buyer's maximum possible

profit from an anticipated sideways to modestly rising market.
Some novices have trouble understanding why a trader would not
always prefer the buy side of the option (call or put, depending on market
opinion), since such a trade has unlimited potential and limited risk.
Such confusion reflects the failure to take probability into account.
Although the option seller's theoretical risk is unlimited, the price levels
that have the greatest probability of occurrence, (i.e., prices in the vicin-

time value. The intrinsic value of a call option is the amount by which the
current market price is above the strike price. (The intrinsic value of a
put option is the amount by which the current market price is below the
strike price.) In effect, the intrinsic value is that part of the premium that
coulcl be realized if the option were exercised at the current market price.
The intrinsic value serves as a floor price for an option. Why? Because if
the premium were less than the intrinsic value, a trader could buy and
exercise the option and immediately offset the resulting market: position,
thereby realizing a net gain (assuming that the trader covers at least
transaction costs).
Options that have intrinsic value (i.e., calls with strike prices below
e ar e) c pri et k ar m e h t e v o b a es c pri e k stri h wit uts p d n a the market price
said to be in the money. Options that have no intrinsic value are called
out of the money options. Options with a strike price closest to the market
price are called al (he -money options.
An out of the money option, which by definition has an intrinsic value
equal to zero, will still have some value because of the possibility that the
market price will move beyond the strike price prior to the expiration
date. An in the money option will have a value greater than the intrinsic
value because a position in the option will be preferred to a position in
the underlying market. Why? Because both the option and the market
position will gain equally in the event of a favorable price movement, but
the option's maximum loss is limited. The portion of the premium that
exceeds the intrinsic value is called the time value.

the money options will have little time value, since it is unlikely that
the market price will move to the strike price—or beyond—prior to
expiration. Deeply in the money options have little time value
because these options offer positions very similar to the underlying
market—both n a ut b all or f s nt u o m a
