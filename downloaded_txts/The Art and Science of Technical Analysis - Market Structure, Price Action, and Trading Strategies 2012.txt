hebookyouareholdinginyourhandsistheproductofnearlytwodecadesofmy
studyandexperienceasatrader,coveringthefullspanofactivelytradedmarkets
and time frames. I owe much to authors and traders who have come before me,
fornooneproducesanythingsignificantinavacuum.Iwouldnothavebeensuccessful
without the help and guidance of my mentors, but I learned many of the lessons here
from my own mistakes. In some ways, this work represents a radical break from many
ofthebooksthathaveprecededit,andIhopeitencouragesyoutoquestionmuchofthe
traditionalthinkingoftechnicalanalysis.
Thisbookdoesnotpresentarigidsystemtobestrictlyfollowed,norasetofsetups

to build a complete perspective on many of the problems traders face. The tools and
techniquesmustbeadaptedtothetrader’spersonalityandbusinesssituation,butmost
willfindafirmfoundationbetweenthesecovers.
There are some underlying themes, perhaps not expressed explicitly, that tie this
work together, and they may be surprising to many readers: Trading is hard. Markets
are extremely competitive. They are usually very close to efficient, and most observed
price movements are random. It is therefore exceedingly difficult to derive a method
that makes superior risk-adjusted profits, and it is even more difficult to successfully
apply such a method in actual trading. Last, it is essential to have a verifiable edge in
themarkets—otherwisenoconsistentprofitsarepossible.Thisapproachsetsthiswork
apartfromthemajorityoftradingbookspublished,whichsuggest thatsimplepatterns
andproperpsychology canleadatradertoimpressiveprofits.Perhapsthisispossible,
butIhaveneverseenitworkinactualpractice.
Thisbookisdividedintofourparts:

Part One begins with a look at some of the probability theory supporting the con-
cepts of successful trading. Next comes an in-depth look at a specific approach to
chart reading that focuses on clarity and consistency lays the foundation for build-

oftechnicalanalysis.
(cid:2)
Part Two focuses on the details of trends, trading ranges, and critically, the tran-
sitions from one to the other in considerable detail. This is a deep look at the un-
derlying foundation of price movements, and there is information here that, to my
knowledge,hasneverappearedinprintbefore.
(cid:2)
Part Three might appear, at first glance, to be the meat of this book, as it includes
specific trading patterns and examples of those patterns applied to real markets. It
also advocates a way of looking at indicators and other confirming factors that re-
quiresadeepunderstandingofthenuancesofthesetools.Oneofthekeyelements
ofanytradingplanishowthetradersizesthetradeandmanagesthepositionasit
develops;theseelementsarealsocoveredinconsiderabledepth.Muchattentionis
devoted to the many risks traders will encounter, both from the market and from
themselves.Thoughmosttradersaregoingtobetemptedtoturndirectlytothissec-
tion,rememberthatthesepatternsareonlythetipofthespear,andtheyaremean-
inglessunlesstheyareplacedwithinthecontextprovidedbyPartsOneandTwo.

PartFourisspecificallywrittenfortheindividualtrader,andbeginsbyfocusingon
elements of psychology such as cognitive biases and issues of emotional control.

Thoughitisimpossibletoreducethetraderdevelopmentprocesstoaone-size-fits-
all formula, the majority of traders struggle with the same issues. Most traders fail
because they do not realize that the process of becoming a trader is a long one,
and they are not prepared tomake the commitment. This section concludes witha
lookatsomeperformance analysis toolsthatcanhelpboththedeveloping andthe

Preface xiii
Thoughthisbookisprimarilywrittenforthatself-directedtrader,thereisalsomuch
informationthatwillbevaluabletoasecondgroupoftradersandmanagerswhodonot
approach markets from a technical perspective or who make decisions within an insti-
tutionalframework.Forthesetraders,someoftheelementssuchastraderpsychology
may appear, at first glance, to be less relevant, but they provide a context for all mar-
ket action. These traders will also find new perspectives on risk management, position
sizing,andpatternanalysisthatmaybeabletoinformtheirworkindifferentareas.
The material in this book is complex; repeated exposure and rereading of certain
sectionswillbeanessentialpartofthelearningprocessformosttraders.Inaddition,the
sizeofthisbookmaybedauntingtomanyreaders.Onceagain,thebookisstructuredto
be read and absorbed from beginning to end. Themes and concepts are developed and
revisited,andrepetitionisusedtoreinforceimportantideas,butitmayalsobehelpful
to have a condensed study plan for some readers. Considering the two discrete target
audiences,Iwouldsuggestthefollowingplans:
(cid:2)
Both the individual and the institutional trader should page through the entire
book,readingwhatevercatchestheirinterest.Eachchapterhasbeenmadeasself-
containedaspossible,whiletryingtokeepredundancytoanabsoluteminimum.
(cid:2)
Afteraninitialquickread,theindividualtradershouldcarefullyreadChapters1and
2,whichprovideafoundationforeverythingelse.Thistradershouldprobablynext
read Part Four (Chapters 11 and 12) in depth, paying particular attention to the el-
ements of the trader development process. Next, turn to Chapters 6 and 10, which
focusonoften-misunderstoodaspectsofriskandpositionsizing.Twoimportantas-
pectsofthebookaremissedonthisfirstread:in-depthanalysisofmarketstructure
andtheuseofconfirmingtoolsinsettingupandmanagingactualtrades.Theseare
topicsfordeeperinvestigationoncetheinitialmaterialhasbeenassimilated.
(cid:2)
For the institutional trader, Chapter 1 is also a logical follow-up to a quick read.
Next, Chapter 2 would provide a good background and motivation for the entire
disciplineoftechnicalanalysis.Chapters8and9willlikelybeveryinterestingtothis
trader.Formanagerswhoareusedtothinkingofriskinaportfoliocontext,thereare
important lessons to be learned from a tactical/technical approach to position and
risk management. Last, many of these readers will have an academic background.

Following both of these study plans, it is advisable to then begin again from the

irst, to Linda Raschke: I owe you a debt I can never repay—who would have
thought your kindness that began with answering a simple e-mail so many years
agowouldhavehadsuchaprofoundimpactonsomeone’slife?
Jose Palau, you played a seminal role in helping me crystallize the ideas for this
book.ThereweretimesinourargumentsthatIwantedtopunchyou,andI’msureitwas
mutual.Intheend,muchofwhatisgoodinthisbookcamefromthosediscussions,and,
asyousaid,“thereisnospoon.”
There have been many others along the way who have challenged my thinking
with new ideas and helped to drive out imprecision and errors in my trading. To Larry
Williams, Mark Fisher, Chris Terry, Ralph Vince, Chuck LeBeau, Victor Niederhoffer,
Michael Gunther, Louis Hazan, Mark D. Cook, David McCracken, Doug Zalesky, and
AndrewBarber,thankyou.AndrewKarolyiandIngridWerner,youexpandedmythink-
ingandopenedmymindtonewpossibilities.
The firstdraftofthisbook wasproduced in45days, but thentherealworkbegan.
Henry Carstens, David Dyte, and Dr. Brett Steenbarger provided invaluable guidance
in the early stages of this project, and helped me to see some of the problems from
many perspectives. Perry Kaufman provided some good quantitiative insights and cri-
tique. Travis Harbauer, you were the best intern imaginable. Being willing to get on a
train at 10:00 p.m. on a Friday night with a flash drive is far above and beyond the call
ofduty!AndAiminWalsh—how(andwhy)doessomeonemeticulouslyproofreada900-
pagemanuscriptinasingleweekwhilehavingareallife,ajob,and,presumably,sleeping
sometime inbetween? Mymother, LilaGrimes, persevered inreading and editingearly
versions of this manuscript, a difficult task but a valuable perspective from someone
not familiar with the subject matter. Thank you also to my small army of interns who
proofread, crunched numbers, and made a thousand small improvements to my work:
BenjaminShopneck,EthanTran,AustinTran,andFredBarnes.Thisprojectwouldhave
taken far longer, and the finished work would have been much weaker, without your
contributions.Thankyousomuchtoallofyou.
I probably would have put off writing this book much longer if not for the encour-
agementofMikeBellafiore.Hisadvice,to“makeabookthatwillbeagifttothetrading

The Trader’s Edge
If you would be a real seeker after truth, it is necessary that at least
onceinyourlifeyoudoubt,asfaraspossible,allthings.
—Rene´ Descartes
T
hereissomethingfascinatingandmesmerizingaboutpricemovementsinactively
traded markets; academics, researchers, traders, and analysts are drawn to study
markets, perhaps captivated as much by the patterns in the market as by the
promise of financial gain. Many people believe that price changes are random and un-
predictable;ifthisweretrue,theonlylogicalcourseofactionwouldbetoavoidtrading
and to invest in index funds. This is, in fact, what a significant number of financial ad-
visers recommend their clients do. On the other hand, there are analysts and traders
whobelievethattheyhavesomeedgeoverthemarket,thatthereissomepredictability
in prices. This camp divides into two groups that historically have been diametrically
opposed: thosewhomakedecisionsbased onfundamentalfactorsandthosewhorely
on technical factors. Fundamental analysts and traders make decisions based on their
assessmentofvalue,throughananalysisofanumberoffactorssuchasfinancialstate-
ments, economic conditions, and an understanding of supply/demand factors. Techni-
cal traders and analysts make decisions based on information contained in past price
changesthemselves.
Our work here concerns the latter approach. Few traders make decisions in a vac-
uum;technicaltradersmayconsiderfundamentalfactors,andfundamentaltradersmay
find that their entries and exits into markets can be better timed with an understand-
ing of the relevant elements of market structure, money flows, and price action. Most
tradersfindsuccesswithahybridapproachthatincorporateselementsfrommanydisci-
plines,andthereareveryfewpurelytechnicalorfundamentaldecisionmakers.Thekey
distinction,forus,isthattechnicallymotivatedtradersacknowledgetheprimacyofprice
itself. They know that price represents the end product of the analysis and decision

Expected Value
Expectedvalue(orexpectancy)isatermfromprobabilitytheorythateverygoodtrader
and gambler understands intuitively. For our purposes, we need to define a number of
scenariosthateachhaveapreciselydefinedpayout(orloss),andwealsoneedtobeable
toquantifytheprobabilitiesofeachscenariooccurring.Ifweareanalyzingactualtrad-
ingrecords,thiscanbeassimpleascalculatingsummarystatisticsforhistoricaltrades,
buttheproblemismuchmorecomplicatedonalook-forwardbasisbecausewehaveto
make assumptions about how closely future conditions are likely to resemble history.
Furthermore, we also need to make sure that our calculations include every possible
outcome so that the probabilities sum to 1.0; this is sometimes difficult in real-world
applications where unforeseeable outlier events may lurk in the future. Leaving these
practicalconsiderationsasideforamomentandfocusingontheunderlyingmath,multi-
plyingthepayoutofeachscenariobytheprobabilityofeachscenariooccurringcreates
aprobability-weightedaverageofthepayouts,whichisalsocalledtheexpectedvalue.
TheExpectedValueFormula
Formally, for k possible scenarios, each with a payoff of x and associated probability p,
theexpectedvalueE()isdefinedas:
E(X)=x p +x p + ··· +x p
1 1 2 2 k k
or,inalternatenotation:
(cid:2)k
E(X)= x p
i i
i=1
Consider a simplified example where a trader can either make or lose 1 point
with 50 percent probability of either outcome. In this example, the relevant math is:
E(X)=.5(1)+.5(−1)=0.Itisimportanttounderstandpreciselywhatexpectancytells
us,which,inthecaseofasimplifiedtradingorgameofchancescenario,istheaverage
amount we should win or lose on each trial. Furthermore, and this is very important,
like many things in the field of probability, expectancy is valid only over a fairly large
sample size. Even though our trader was playing a zero expectancy game, it is entirely
possiblethatthetradercouldhavehadmanywinsorlossesinarow,andcouldactually

The bottom line is that you must have an edge. If you are not trading with a statis-
tical advantage over the market, everything else is futile. Nothing will help. Discipline,
money management, execution skills, and positive thinking add great value in support

Where Does the Edge Come From?
Many of the buying and selling decisions in the market are made by humans, either as
individuals, in groups (as in an investment committee making a decision), or through
extension (as in the case of execution algorithms or “algos”). One of the assumptions
of academic finance is that people make rational decisions in their own best interests,
aftercarefullycalculatingthepotentialgainsandlossesassociatedwithallpossiblesce-
narios. This may be true at times, but not always. The market does not simply react to
newinformationflow;itreactstothatinformationasitisprocessedthroughthelensof
human emotion. People make emotional decisions about market situations, and some-
timestheymakemistakes.Informationmaybeoverweightedorunderweightedinanal-
ysis,andeveryone,evenlargeinstitutions,dealswiththeemotionsoffear,greed,hope,
andregret.
In an idealized, mathematical random walk world, price would have no memory of
where it has been in the past; but in the real world, prices are determined by traders
making buy and sell decisions at specific times and prices. When markets revisit these
specific prices, the market does have a memory, and we frequently see nonrandom ac-
tion on these retests of important price levels. People remember the hopes, fears, and
painassociatedwithpriceextremes.Inaddition,mostlarge-scalebuyingfollowsamore
or less predictable pattern: traders and execution algorithms alike will execute part of
large orders aggressively, and then will wait to allow the market to absorb the action
beforeresumingtheirexecutions.Themoreaggressivethebuyers,thefurthertheywill
liftoffersandthelesstheywillwaitbetweenspurtsofbuying.Thistypeofaction,and
the memory of other traders around previous inflections, creates slight but predictable
tendenciesinprices.
Thereisnomystical,magicalprocessatworkhereoratanyothertimeinthemar-
ket.Buyingandsellingpressuremovesprices—onlythis,andnothingmore.Ifsomeone
really wants to buy and to buy quickly, the market will respond to the buying and sell-
ers will raise their offers as they realize they can get a better (higher) price. Similarly,
whenlargesellordershitthemarket,buyerswhowerewaitingonthebidwillgetoutof
thewaybecausetheyrealizethatextrasupplyhascomeintothemarket.Moreurgency
to sell means lower prices. More buying pressure means higher prices. The conclusion
is logical and unavoidable: buying and selling pressure must, by necessity, leave pat-
terns in the market. Our challenge is to understand how psychology can shape market
structureandpriceaction,andtofindplaceswherethisbuyingandsellingpressurecre-
atesopportunitiesintheformofnonrandompriceaction.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF CHART READING

ChartScaling:LinearversusLog
The one exception to the principle of keeping charts consistent might be in the case of
very long-term charts spanning multiple years, or shorter-term charts in which an asset
has greatly increased in value (by over 100 percent). In these cases, the vertical axis of
the chart should be scaled logarithmically (called “semi-log” in some charting packages)
tobetterreflectthegrowthrateofthemarket.Theideabehindalogscalechart isthat
the same vertical distance always represents the same percentage growth regardless of
locationontheaxis.
On a very long-term chart, linearly scaled charts will often make price changes at
lowerpricelevelssosmallthattheydisappearandtheyarecompletelydwarfedbyprice
changes that happened at higher levels. The linear scale also magnifies the importance
ofthosehigher-levelpricechanges,makingthemseemmoreviolentandsignificantthan

Choosing Time Frames
Discretionary traders must clearly choose and define the timeframewithinwhich they
will trade, and this choice of time frames is tied into deeper questions of personality
andtradingstyle.Mostofthetradingideasandprinciplesweexamineinthisbookcan
beappliedtoallmarketsandalltimeframes,withsomeadjustments,butmosttraders
will probably find themselves best suited to a specific set of markets and time frames.
Tradersswitchingtimeframesorassetclasseswillusuallyundergoapainfuladjustment
period while they figure out how toapply their tools inthe new context. For now, let’s
leavetheseimportantconsiderationsbehindandfocusononlythemechanicalissuesof
setting up charts to cover multiple time frames. In the end, your charts must be a tool
thatservesyourtradingstyle,nottheotherwayaround.
Manyauthorshavewrittenabouttheadvantagesofcombiningmultipletimeframes.
Multipletimeframescanprovidecontextforandinformpatternsonasingletimeframe;
skilleduseofmultipletimeframesallowstraderstobettermanageriskandtoincrease
the expectancy of their trading plans. Nearly all technical traders consider action and
structureinothertimeframes,thoughtheydothisinavarietyofways.Sometradersare
able to infer this information from a single chart, while many others prefer to actually
look at multiple charts of the same market with each chart showing a different time
frame.Inaschemelikethis,theprimarytimeframeoffocusiscalledthetrading time
frame (TTF). A higher time frame (HTF) chart provides a bigger-picture perspective,
whilealowertimeframe(LTF)chartisusuallyusedtofindpreciseentrypoints.Other
variations, with up to five or six charts, are possible, and there are many traders who
use only a pair of charts. Last, though the term time frame seems to imply that the x-
axisofthechartwillbeatimescale(minutes,hours,days,etc.),thesameproportional
relationships can be applied to tick, volume, or any other activity-based axis scale on
thex-axis.
In general, time frames should be related to each other by a factor of 3 to 5. There
is no magic in these ratios, but the idea is that each time frame should provide new in-
formationwithoutlossofresolutionorunnecessaryrepetition.Forinstance,ifatrader
is watching a 30-minute chart, a 5- or 10-minute chart probably provides new informa-
tionaboutwhatisgoingoninsideeach30-minutebar,whereasa1-minutechartwould
omit significant information. Using a 20-minute chart in conjunction with a 30-minute
chart probably adds no new information, as the two charts will be very similar. One
lesser-known relationship is that all vertical distances on charts scale with the square

Bars, Candles, or Other Choices
Most traders today seem to be focused on using candlestick charts, but the more old-
fashioned bar charts should not be overlooked. Both chart types display thesame data
pointsbutinaslightlydifferentformat;theyhavethesameinformationonthem,soone
isnotbetterthantheother.Themainadvantageofbarchartsisthattheycanbecleaner
visually and it is usually possible to fit more data in the same space because bars are
thinner than candles. For many traders, the colors of candlestick charts make it easier
toseethebuyingandsellingpressureinthemarket,providinganotherimportantvisual

Anotherissuetoconsider,particularlywithintradaycharts,ishowmuchimportance

THE TWO FORCES: TOWARD A NEW
UNDERSTANDING OF MARKET ACTION
Price actionisacomplexandimperfectlydefinedsubject.Therearemanytraderswho
believe that price action is something nebulous that cannot be quantified. To other
traders, trading price action means trading the patterns of price bars on charts, with-
out the addition of indicators or other lines. In this book, price action simply means
howmarketsusuallymove,which,frankly,is,usuallyrandomly.Beclearonthispoint:

and many more, combine to describe how the market moves in response to order flow
andamyriadofcompetinginfluences.
In the past, many authors have used a wide range of analogies to describe finan-
cialmarkets.Ideasandmodelshavebeenborrowedfromthephysicalandmathematical
sciences,sotermslikemomentum,inertia,vectors,andtrajectorieshavecreptintothe
vocabulary.Morerecently,somethinkershaveappliedthetoolsofdigitalsignalprocess-
ing to market data, so we have a new vocabulary that includes cycles, transforms, and
waves.Marketsareconfusingenoughintheirnaturalstate;someoftheanalyticalframe-
works traders use add to the confusion. I propose a simpler model: that market action

Market action in this environment is highly random; if we were to analyze this type of
actionstatistically,wewouldfindthatitconformsverycloselytoarandomwalkmodel.
This is also precisely the type of environment that technically motivated traders must
strivetoavoid,astherecanbenoenduringstatisticaledgeinarandomlydrivenmarket.
Marketsinthisstateofequilibriumwillhavevaryingdegreesofliquidityandability
to absorb large orders. Eventually, there is a failure of liquidity on one side, and the
market makes a sudden, large movement in one direction. Perhaps this movement is
in response to new information coming into the market, or it can simply be a result
of a random price movement setting off further movement in the same direction. No
matter the reason behind the movement, in theoretical terms, the motive force has, at
leasttemporarily,overcometheresistiveforce.Intheparlanceoftechnicalanalysis,this
typeofsharpmovementiscalledanimpulsemoveoramomentummove.
From this point, there are basically two options. In many cases, the resistive force
is quickly able to overcome the motive force, and the market finds balance again. This
may be at a new level, or prices may immediately retrace their course and return to
thepreshocklevels.Psychologically,marketparticipantshavechosentoviewthislarge

develops where the market makes a large movement, which, in turn, provokes another

In most cases, the market structure of this trending movement will be a series
of directional moves alternating with nondirectional periods in which the market

has overcome the resistive force, but there is still a subtle interplay of balance and

PRICE ACTION AND MARKET STRUCTURE
ON CHARTS
Charts are a way to organize and to structure the flood of information the market gen-
eratesandcanrevealcluesaboutthestrengthoftheunderlyingforces.Thereisnoone

ofmarketstructurearepivotpointsandtheswingsconnectingthem,bothofwhichmay
beevaluatedeitherinprice(theverticalaxisonachart),intime(thehorizontalaxis),or
inacombinationofthetwo.
Price action is the dynamic process that creates market structure. Price action is
also more subjective; in most cases, market structure is concrete. Market structure is
static and is clearly visible on a chart, but price action usually must be inferred from
marketstructure.Also,botharespecifictotimeframes,thoughpriceactionisoftenvisi-
bleasthemarketstructureoflowertimeframes.Thesedefinitionsandtheirimplications

Pivot Points
The basic units of market structure on any time frame are pivot highs and lows (also
calledswinghighsorlows).Apivothighisabarthathasahigherhighthanthebarthat
came before it and the bar that comes after it. At least in the very short term, the bar’s

usethisconceptsystematically,makesureyourrulesplanforthissituation.
Predictably, this concept can be extended on many levels, but in actual practice,
most of our focus is on third-order pivots, which usually mark major inflections (see
Figure 1.5). Almost without exception, a trader who could identify these third-order
pivots in advance would have nearly perfect entries on both sides of the market. This
cannot be done, but it does point out that these third-order pivots delineate the mar-
ket structure very clearly. It is worth your time to train your eye to see these pivots
quickly; the value in this structure is in providing context for the market’s movements.
Once you understand the basic ideas behind this concept, it is probably a good idea
to not be too rigid with these structures and definitions. If you see something on a
chart that is fulfilling the basic role of one of these structures but for one reason or
another does not exactly fit the criteria, it often makes sense to bend the rules for
that case. The goal is to define meaningful market structure, not to blindly follow a set
ofrules.

you, it is probably a good idea to draw the structure on a few hundred charts until it
becomes somewhat intuitive; eventually you want to be able to glance at a chart and

about markets. There were giants on the earth in those days—legends like Jesse

environment,RichardWyckoffdevelopedhisunderstandingofmarketsandthetrading
processthroughconversationsandinterviewswiththesemastertraders.Afteramassing
a sizable personal fortune in the markets, he laid out his system in a set of correspon-
dence courses, as was the practice of the day, to educate the public and to help them
avoid the scams and frauds that were so prevalent at the time. Referring to the Wyck-

Wyckoff proposed a four-stage market cycle. His idea was that the cycle resulted
from the actions of these large players who planned their operations in the market to
take advantage of the uneducated public’s inappropriate reactions to price movement,
but we also see evidence of this cycle in the price patterns of assets such as medieval
commodity prices; stocks in early, unsophisticated markets; or trading on very short
timeframes.Itisunlikelythatthereisthesameinterventionandmanipulationinallof
these cases, so the Wyckoff cycle may simply be an expression of the normal ways in

WYCKOFF’S MARKET CYCLE
Inthisbriefintroduction,wewillconsiderthreeaspectsofeachphaseofthecycle.First,
we will try to understand the market using a simplified model focusing on the psycho-
logical perspective of two major groups: the smart money players who are assumed to
bedrivingthemarket,andthegeneral,uninformedpublic.Second,wewillconsiderthe
crowdpsychologyofthepublic,andhowindividualsarenaturallyinclinedtomakemis-
takes that work in favor of the smart money. Last, we will begin to consider the dis-
tinctions and patterns of each part of the cycle from a pure price-pattern perspective;
this analysis is important because it motivates and provides context for many trading
patternsandmethods.

Accumulation—Building a Base
Accumulationisthefirststageofthecycle;largeoperators(funds,banks,otherinstitu-
tions,orevenlargeindividualtraders)buywithoutalertingthepublictotheirintentions.
This is actually very difficult to do, as buying pressure will naturally support and even
raise prices. These players must buy slowly and generally passively over a long period
of time to build their positions. From a technical perspective, prices move sideways in
atradingrangeboundedbyroughareasofsupportandresistance,anintermediate-term
movingaverageisflat,andpricechopsbackandforthonbothsidesofthatmovingaver-
age.Aswementionedearlier,theseconditionsareindicativeofamarketinequilibrium,
and most technical traders should avoid trading price action like this. However, Wyck-
off argues that this is precisely the goal of the longer-term players. They are working
very hard to make this look like a market in equilibrium, but it is not. There is a subtle
imbalance as smart money is buying and accumulating positions in preparation for the
cominguptrend.
There are a few important points to keep in mind about a market in accumulation.
First, there is the obvious play of positioning in the accumulation area with the smart
money;inmostcasesthisisessentiallyahighertimeframeplay.Thelinebetweentrad-
ing and investing can become somewhat blurred if the technical trader plays in these
areas,butthekeydifferenceisthattradersremainalertforsignsthattheaccumulation

usually not simple plays in actual practice. It is difficult to time the precise beginning

oftenfindthemselvesexecutingatexactlythewrongpointsastheyreacttopricespikes
inthenoisyrange.Thisiswhatthemarketactionisdesignedtodointheseareas,sodo
notplaythisgame.
There are some price patterns and clues we typically see associated with classic
accumulation. The most common of these is what Wyckoff called a spring, which is
called a failure test at the bottom of the range in modern terminology. To understand
thispattern,thinkofitfromtheperspectiveofthelargeplayersaccumulatinginventory
intherange.Iftheselargebuyersweretogointothemarketandbuyaggressively,that

are good for these players, who are trying to accumulate large positions at the lowest
possible price. What if they wanted to judge the other market participants’ interest in
the stock? Perhaps they might stop buying altogether and let the market fall under its
ownweight.

the large players just got an important piece of information: there is underlying buying
interestinthemarket.
Keep in mind that these types of buyers, and so this type of price action, tend to
be very large and very slow moving. These are usually institutions that may buy many
times the stock’s average daily trading volume, so most of these plays develop on an
almostglacialscale;but,evenso,therearecriticalinflectionpointsthatcanbedefined
in minutes or seconds. These drops below the bottom of the accumulation range are
examplesofspecificpointsintimethatrequireattentionandfocus.
Thepresenceofotherbuyersjustunderthelevelwheretheinstitutionswerebuying

notice.Theclassicfirstreactionisdisbelief,followedbyadesiretofade(goagainst)the
move. If Wheat futures have been locked in a $1.00 range for a couple of years, most
people are apt to regard a price $0.50 above that range as too high and will be inclined
to short, thinking the aberration will correct itself. This price movement will still not
be in focus in the major media, but, when people do talk about it, they will almost uni-
versallyobservethat“fundamentalsdonotsupportthismove”andtherearealsomany
narrative factors that suggest “the risk is too high to consider buying up here.” At the
beginning of trends, the prevailing mind-set from the public is usually that the trend is
somehowwrong.
As the trend grinds higher, the early, aggressive shorts will be forced tocover, and
their buying pressure will, in turn, push the market higher. (Here is a clear example
whereshortsellersareactuallyasourceofsignificantbuyingpressure;thingsarenever

commodity, there will be news stories about how the world is running out of the com-
modity, probably a story here and there about some blight that will destroy the crop
on one continent or another, and what are basically calls for the end of the world. For
some reason, no one will notice that farmers just planted three times the acreage that

was important that they hide their buying so as to not cause the market to break into
an uptrend too early. Similarly, they must now sell carefully because too much selling

To the untrained eye, distribution areas are indistinguishable from accumulation
areas—they are both large, sideways ranges. However, on a more subtle level, we will
seethatmanyoftheclassicsignsofaccumulationwillnotbepresent.Whenpricesdrop

not marks the very bottom, and the market stabilizes into accumulation in preparation
forthenextuptrend.
Marketstructureandpriceactioninadowntrendarenotaperfectmirrorimageof
the first stage, but the differences are subtle and difficult to quantify. One of the major
piecesofreceivedwisdomfromold-schooltradersisthatmarketstendtogodownmuch
faster than they go up. There is some truth to this, as volatility reliably expands on de-
clines in many markets, and there is also a subjective side to the analysis, as there is a
distinctlydifferentfeeltoralliesinabearmarketcomparedtosell-offsinabullmarket.
Bothstructuresarepullbacksinestablishedtrends,butthereisaspecialkindoffrantic-
nessandvolatilitythatseemstobeauniqueattributeofbearmarkets.Bearmarketrallies
tendtobesharpandvicious,whereaspullbacksinbullmarketsareusuallymuchmore
orderly.Thereisasurprisingdegreeofsymmetry—mostelementsofuptrendsanddown-
trends are mirror images of each other (reflected around the y-axis), but most traders
also find that a very different skill set is required to trade each environment. This may
explainwhysometradersavoidbearmarketswhereasothersspecializeinthem.
The Cycle in Action
The structure laid out here was originally conceived around the equity markets and on
time frames ranging from months to years. It applies especially well there, but it also
has relevance to other markets and shorter time frames. Commodity markets tend to
followasimilarcycle,butthecycleincommoditiesisoftendrivenbytheproductionand
consumptioncycle.Commodities,ingeneral,tendtobealittlemorecyclicalandmore
prone to seasonal distortions, especially of volatility, than stock indexes are. Currency
markets tend to be a little less cyclical and tend to trend better than most other asset
classes over longer time frames. That said, there certainly are times when this cycle
doesapplytothecurrencymarkets—forinstance,inextremesituationsaccompaniedby
emotionalelationorstress.
The concept of fractal markets, as Mandelbrot and Hudson (2006) have written
about, is especially important when considering the Wyckoff cycle. Simply put, this
means that the same patterns appear in very long-term markets as in very short-term
markets. However, much of the academic work supporting this concept does not rec-
ognize that patterns may not be tradable on all time frames. It is not always possible
to trade 5-minute charts the same way as weekly charts, even though the patterns may
superficiallyappeartobesimilar.Inaddition,notenoughworkhasbeendoneontherela-
tionshipoffractalmarketsandliquidity.Intheshortertimeframes,patternsarebounded

THE FOUR TRADES
Wyckoff’s market cycle is a highly idealized view of market action, but it does lay the
foundation for a simple categorization of technical trades into four categories. There
are two trend trades: trend continuation and trend termination, and two support and
resistancetrades:holdingandfailing.Thoughthismayseemlikeanarbitraryclassifica-
tionsystem,itisnot.Everytechnicaltradeimaginablefallsintooneofthesecategories.
Tradesfromcertaincategoriesaremoreappropriateatcertainpointsinthemarketstruc-
ture,soitisworthwhiletocarefullyconsideryourtradesinthiscontext.
The first question to consider is: Are all of your trade setups in one category? If
so,thismaynotbeabadthing—asuccessful tradingmethodology mustfitthetrader’s
personality—but most traders will have the best results when they have at least two
counterbalancingsetups.Forinstance,atraderwhofocusesonbreakouttradesshould
probablyunderstandthepatternsoffailedbreakouts.Atraderwhotradespullbacksin

There are two reasons behind this suggestion. First, you should become intimately fa-

Some market environments favor certain kinds of plays over others. If you are a
trader who trades all categories, are you applying the right kind of plays to the right
marketenvironments?Forinstance,doyoufindyourselfhavingmanylosingtradestry-
ing to short against resistance levels in uptrends because you feel they have gone too
far? If so, your results might improve if you apply with-trend trades to those situations
and more carefully define the market environments that will reward your fading (go-
ing against the trend) of strength into resistance. Those environments exist—you just
aren’tfindingthemwithyourplays.Ifyouareaspecialistwhofocusesononlyonesetup

you need to realize that only a few specific market environments favor your play and

Trend continuation plays tend to be high-probability plays because there is a ver-
ifiable, statistical edge for trend continuation; these plays are aligned with one of the
fundamental principles of price behavior. It is important to have both the risk and the
expectationofthetradedefinedbeforeentry;thisisanabsoluterequirementofanyspe-

higher prices will bring enough sellers into the market that a new, perhaps temporary,

subsequent trend legs making similar new impulse moves, and the absence of strong
countertrendmomentumonpullbacks.

across pushes one and two, indicating a short-term climax on a lower time frame. The

A good rule of thumb is to expect retracements to terminate at about 50 percent
of the preceding setup leg, plus or minus a very large margin of error. In practice, one
good rule might be to look for terminations somewhere in the 25 to 75 percent range,
but not to be surprised to see terminations either shallower or deeper. You basically

2. The pullback fails dramatically as sharp, countertrend momentum emerges. The
challenge is to distinguish between this scenario and the more common complex
consolidation.
3. The next trend leg emerges out of the pullback, but it fails in the neighborhood of
the previous swing (i.e., the high of the setup leg in an uptrend or the low of the
setupleginadowntrend).
Flat Pullback One of the most common pullback failure patterns occurs when the
market begins what looks like a good pullback but then there is simply no move out
of that pullback. Instead, the market goes into a flat range, indicating that buyers and
sellersareinrelativebalance.Tradinginthisnewrangeisusuallyabadideasinceprice
action will be random and not driven by any real order flow. Also, breakouts from this
new range are treacherous, with the potential for fake-outs in either direction. In most

Sharp Countertrend Momentum as Pullback Is Violated Thepreviousexam-
ple showed a case where a pullback failed via sharp contratrend momentum after first
going into a sideways range. However, the market is not always so polite. Some of the
most dangerous pullback failures, at least in terms of the possibility of creating large
losses, occur when the pullback simply fails sharply by breaking to the “wrong side.”
Pullbacksthatwereanticipatedtohavebeencontinuationpatternsinuptrendsmayfail
through sharp breakdowns, and vice versa. These are the patterns that make risk man-

conceptually the same. The market reaches the neighborhood of the first profit target
and simply is not able to trade very far beyond that target. For traders taking partial
profits here, these patterns are not even actually failures; the first target was reached.
The important point is that traders should always be on guard for potential failure at

with a broad, structural approach to trend identification. This is pure market structure
approach based largely on the work of the early authors who laid out the principles of
whatbecameknownastheDowTheory.
Dow Theory Trend Patterns
An uptrend is a pattern of successively higher pivot highs (HHs) and higher pivot lows
(HLs) (see Figure 3.25). Both are important. Most people readily accept a definition of
anuptrendthatrequireshigherhighs;thisisintuitive,butitiseasytooverlooktheim-
portance of accompanying higher lows; if a market is only making higher highs, but is
notalsoclearlyholdinghigherlows,thebuyersarenotsolidlyincontrolofthatmarket.
Conversely,adowntrendisaseriesofbothlowerlows(LLs)andlowerhighs(LHs)(see
Figure3.26).Thisisperhapsthemostelementarydefinitionoftrendpossibleonanytime

Under this system, there are three possible trend states: up, down, or uncertain;
manypeopleincorrectlyassumethatamarketiseitherinanuptrendorinadowntrend,
but the third possibility is important. There are several reasons that a trend could be
identified as uncertain. For example, perhaps the pattern in the market actually is un-
clear and more or less random; we can usually force any structure into some pattern,
butsuchaProcrusteanapproachisrarelyconstructive.Itisfarbettertohavetoolsthat

call looking at the same data on a different day. To some critics, this invalidates the
disciplineoftechnicalanalysis,orforcesthemtofocusononlytheobjectiveelements.
This is a mistake, because some of the most powerful tools of technical analysis are at
least partially subjective. The question should be: How can we build, refine, and verify
thevalidityofoursubjectiveanalyses?
This is a good question. Part of the answer is to remember that the beginner has
not seen enough market data to start to develop this subjective sense. For this reason,
beginnersareprobablybetteradvisedtostickwithmoreconcreteelements,andtotake
carefulnotesoftheirimpressionsandsubjectivejudgmentsasintuitionstartstodevelop.
Intuition,theclassic“marketfeel,”isbasedonacombinationofanumberofelements,
most of which in themselves are fairly objective. Where the subjective element comes

Tostart,consideranimportantrefinementtotheconceptofsupportandresistance.This
may seem like a subtle and insignificant point, but it is important. Anytime you think,
speak,orwriteaboutasupportarea,attachthewordpotentialtothatdefinition.Prices
are not coming down to a support area; they are coming down to a potential support
area. Too many times, traders think that these areas are magic lines on the chart, and
that price will bounce there. This may be as much a function of language as anything
else,butthischangeinthinkingwillremindyouthatthebestwecansayaboutasupport

Inaddition,supportandresistanceshouldproperlybethoughtofaszonesorareas

a crayon might be the appropriate tool, not a drafting pen. It is unrealistic to expect
prices to come to a potential resistance level and to stop precisely at the level. It is far

Broken Support Becomes Resistance
Oneoftheclassicrulesofsupportandresistanceisthatsupport,onceviolated,becomes
resistance.Conversely,resistance,onceviolated,becomessupport.(Youalreadyshould
bethinking,“Waitaminute—support,onceviolated,becomespotentialresistance.”)The
reason given for this is that traders made a stand at a previous resistance level by at-
tempting to sell enough to hold down prices. They failed when price traded through
thatresistance,andthosetradersincurredlossesontheirshortpositionsthatwereen-
tered at the level. If price returns to the same level after trading higher, they will be at
breakevenontheirshortsandwillcoverthem(buythemback)inanattempttoreduce

intobuyingpressureatthesamelevel,whichmaybeabletoatleasttemporarilyhalta

Thekeytobothofthesepatternsisthattheyarequickprobesbeyondsupportand

that there was “no conviction” beyond the level, or that prices did not want to “hang
out” at the new extremes. Psychologically, these formations usually suggest that there

are a large buyer looking to buy as close to a specific price (the bottom of the range)
as possible; your goal is to get the best price you can by buying as low as you can. If
the market trades down to that price, you may buy a little, but if it is weak you might
hold off a bit to see if it will fall even lower. If the market then trades through your
buy point, you may buy a little more, but you might also be willing to let the market
continue to fall. Why hold it up with your own buying if you can buy lower? However,

There are always two sides to every trade, and it is a good mental exercise to cul-
tivate the practice of trying to see price action from as many different perspectives as
possible. Imagine that you are a trader shorting the market into the same level where
the previous buyer was willing to buy. You are looking for weakness and further ex-
tensionbelow thelevel,sowhatdoyoudointhesamescenario? Once pricedropsbe-

than hold a failed trade, most traders would elect to buy back the short. Your cover-

positions or to cover shorts. Buying is buying, and, all other things being equal, it will
pushpriceshigher.

Price Action around Support/Resistance One of the reasons for attaching the
qualifier potential to support and resistance is to remind us that these levels do not al-
wayshold.Whentradersarefirstintroducedtotheseconcepts,theyexpectthatsupport
and resistance areas will be lines that willcontain price movements on charts and that
tradescanbeeasilysetupontheselevels.Thisisthemostbasicentry-levelknowledge,
and the problem with it is that it is not true. It is much more difficult to identify true
levels than many traders think (i.e., they are much more rare than much of the trad-
ing literature suggests), and, in actual practice, these levels break just about as often
as they hold. For instance, one definition of a trend is that it is a type of price move-
mentorpriceactionthatbreakssupportorresistance—therepeatedfailureofsupport
or resistance is what actually drives trends. When resistance eventually is able to hold
againstanuptrend,thetrendwillpauseandthemarketwillenterconsolidation.Fortu-
nately,therearesomecharacteristicpatternsassociatedwithlevelsholdingorbreaking

Ingeneral,mosttradersfindthatthedifficulttradestoexecuteareoftenthebesttrades.
It is very easy to buy a market as it grinds down into a support level, but it would
have been much harder to buy the AUDJPY near that extreme support level. The best
tests of support and resistance usually combine an objective, clear level with some
form of overextension. In other words, a large price spike down to support is likely
to set up a better bounce from that level than would a slow trend down into support.
In fact, a market trending down into support is not showing price rejection, and this
type of pressure often presages a significant break of support. The quick spike test,
or a test of an oversold market coming into support, requires real execution skills, as
prices will be moving quickly, spreads will be wide, and there may be an extreme lack
of liquidity in the book. In addition, there is the chance of a large loss if prices con-
tinue to drop or drop even faster. But skilled traders find that they are compensated
for these risks by quick profits and a good expected value over a large set of these
trades. If you are uncomfortable buying spikes to support or shorting spikes to resis-
tance,consideraddingthesetoyourtradingplan.Attheveryleast,itmaymakesenseto

Multiple Tests This is not to say that price will touch the level once, never to re-
turn. It is certainly possible for a level to have multiple tests, and it can be difficult
to read the balance of buying and selling conviction on these subsequent tests. Each
test actually weakens the level because price should not be able to return to the level
if it is going to hold. If there is genuine demand at a level, why did buyers not chase
prices higher? Why are we back here? Those are the questions you need to ask. Tradi-
tional technical analysis tells us that a level is more valid the more times it is tested,
but I believe that this is one of those pieces of the conventional wisdom that is ab-
solutely wrong. If a level is going to hold, it should be tested once, twice, or maybe
threetimes,andthenthereshouldbeamoveawayfromthelevelbackedbystrongcon-
viction. If price is able to return to the level three or more times, probabilities begin
to shift in favor of the level breaking. Traders make a critical mistake when they buy
in front of the same support level multiple times, because the confidence that comes

areusuallyconsolidationsinthetrendthatprecededthem,andareusuallycontinuation
patterns.Inmyexperience,thisisoneofthepiecesofconventionalwisdomthatiscor-
rect;itmakessensetoapproachmostrangeswiththeideathattheywillbecontinuation

helpfultoconsidertheseformationsonhighertimeframes.Afteranextendedtrendrun
onthetradingtimeframe,themarketmaybeessentiallyunreadableonthattimeframe
asitentersintoalargetradingrangewithmanyunpredictablemovements.However,the
higher time frame will often tell a simple story: the trading time frame trend may have
pushedthehighertimeframeintoanoverboughtoroverextendedcondition,andtheun-
readablerangeonthetradingtimeframeisactuallyjustasimplepullbackonthehigher
timeframe.Thisisacaseofahighertimeframeprovidingclaritybypullingusupoutof

Consider Figure 4.14, which shows daily and weekly charts of the S&P 500 Cash
indexinlate2008.Thedailychartintheleftpaneisamess;itisveryhardtosussoutany
usefulinformationfromthischart—therearemanycompetingandconflictingtechnical

is a case where the longer range on the daily chart resolves into a simple continuation
patternonthehighertimeframe.
Reversal Ranges
The other possibility is that the range can be a reversal of the higher time frame trend.
Anyofthefactorsthatcansuggestanendofatrendononetimeframe(overextension,
momentum divergence, specific terminating formations, etc.) apply to all time frames.

BREAKOUT TRADE: TRADING RANGE TO TREND
The term breakout trade is applied to a class of trades where the trader attempts to
enterinthedirectionthemarketisalreadymoving,usuallywhenasupportorresistance
level is broken. Many breakout trades come at points where the market has pressed
againstthesamesupportorresistancelevelseveraltimes,buthasbeenunabletobreak
(or hold) beyond that price level. Once the level is actually broken, pent-up buying or
selling pressure may drive the market into a sharp, dramatic trend. It is easy to find
examplesofgoodbreakouttradesoncharts(seeFigure5.1)whereatradercouldhave
realizedanextremelyhighreward/riskratiobytakingapositiononthebreakout.There
areanumberofprofitabletradingsystemsthatrelyonbreakoutentries,andanecdotal
evidencesuggeststhatthistradeentrywasoneofthemainconceptsbehindtheTurtles’
success in the 1980s and 1990s. There is also good, simple logic for focusing on these
typesoftrades:ifamarketisgoingtogohigher,ithastotakeoutpreviouspricehighs.If
amarketisgoinglower,itmusttakeoutpreviouslowsintheprocess.Tradersfocusing
onbreakouttradeswillnaturallycatchallthebigtrendmoves.
There is a significant problem—the majority of breakout trades fail. In most cases,
excursionsbeyondsupportorresistanceareusuallyshort-lived,astheyarequicklymet
by offsetting pressure that pushes the market back into the range. Traders indiscrimi-
natelyenteringbreakoutswouldfindthatanyprofitstheymakewouldbeeatenawayby
transactioncostsandbyfailedbreakouts.Inmanycases,volatilityishighandliquidityis
lowatthesepoints.Eveninthebestcases,withthebestpossibleriskcontrol,thesmall
losses will quickly add up. In the end, it is a case of death by a thousand cuts that will
slowlygrindatradingaccountdowntonothing.
There is a slight division in the trading world between equity traders and futures
traders regarding terminology for these trades. To most stock traders, a breakout is
specifically a break above resistance, while a breakdown is a break below support; in
other words, a breakout is a long trade, while a breakdown is a short. Futures traders,

large traders are selling, or vice versa? Since these large traders have often positioned

thisascendingtrianglepattern,imaginethatamarketisoscillatingrandomlyinatrading

wouldnaturallywanttobuyataslowapriceaspossible,sotheywouldusethedeclines
tobeginbuying.Eventuallytheirbuyingpressurewillarrestthedeclineandthemarket
will resume its upward movement, at which point they will likely turn off their buying
to avoid paying elevated prices. Skilled operators could even offer some of their line
out, with the dual intent of booking a small profit and of actually holding prices down
by their selling pressure. If several large buyers recognize this activity in the market,
theywillbecomemoreaggressiveintheirbuying,whilestillattemptingtomeasureand

breakout point. It is overly optimistic to assume that prices will trade cleanly through
the breakout level and never come back. (This, incidentally, is the absolute best-case
scenario for breakout traders, and trades like this are rare.) However, there are some
commonpatternsattheactualbreakoutpointthatcanseparatethebestbreakouttrades
fromtherest.
High Volatility Abreakoutshouldbeaclearlyvisibleevent.Ifamarketapproaches

increasedvolume,activity,andinterestassociatedwiththeactualbreakout.Ingeneral,
the ranges of individual bars should expand, and they almost always will expand on
lower time frames. Breakouts from less significant levels may not always see this
increased volatility, but a good breakout that marks a transition to an extended trend
is almost always a volatile event. Note that it may be difficult to measure this volatility
with traditional measures, but the quantitative measures that will be most useful will
beinstantaneousmeasuresofvolatilitysuchastheratioofthecurrentbar’srangetoa
windowofpreviousbars.
Slippage Is Good Thedifferencebetweentheintendedandactualexecutionprices
in a trade is called slippage. If a trader is planning on paying a breakout above $20.00
and receives fills at $20.20, this is 20 cents of slippage and can be a significant cost of
trading. Most traders think of slippage as only that: a bad thing, a cost to be avoided.
However,aroundbreakoutpoints,slippageisactuallydesirable.Itshouldbedifficultto
buyamarketmakingagoodbreakout.Youshouldhavetopayhigherpricestogetinif
themarketisreallymoving.
Many traders panic when they receive significant slippage. A bad fill is seen as in-
creasingriskandcuttingintoprofits,anditishardtoarguewiththislogic,atleastonthe
surface.Thinkdeeper,though,andconsiderthepossiblereasonsforthebadfill.Some-

ImmediateSatisfaction Thelogicalextensionofallofthesefactors,andoneofthe
reasonsthatcertainpersonalitytypesaredrawntothiskindoftrading,isthatthebreak-
out trader should receive immediate feedback on whether the trade is right or wrong.
As always, immediate must be taken in context. If trading intraday, then confirmation
should come within seconds, but a trader trading on the weekly time frame might de-
mandsomeconfirmationofthetradewithinafewdays.Immediatesatisfactiondoesnot

and immediately be offered at $20.10. This isnothing more than extra volatilityand or-
der flow around the breakout level, which is to be expected, and the trader can now
begintheprocessofmanagingthetrade.Ontheotherhand,abreakouttradethatispaid
for at $20.15 and then immediately begins to slowly grind lower is no breakout at all.

Especially for short-term traders, breakout trading can be exciting, and the immediate
feedbackallowsforrapidlearningandskilldevelopment.
Patterns Following Good Breakouts
Inagoodbreakout,theextravolatilityandone-sidedliquidityleadtoasharpmoveabove
thebreakoutlevel.Nothinginthemarketcontinuesindefinitely,though,andeventually
this initial thrust gives way to a pause and a pullback. This is a critical point because,
if the breakout is the beginning of a new trend, this first pullback after the breakout is
theoptimaltimetoestablishpositionsforthenewtrend.Ifthebreakoutisgoingtofail,
it is going to fail at this first pullback. In addition, the character of the price action in
thisfirstpullbackcancommunicatealotofinformationabouttheconvictionbehindthe
moveandthecharacterofthemarket.
Pullback Holds Outside the Breakout Level Thisisprobablythemostintuitive
example,andtheonethatmanytradersfocusmostoftheireffortson.Themarketbreaks
throughthelevel,tradessharplybeyondthelevel,andthenmakesacleanpullbackthat
holdsoutsidethebreakoutlevel.Thismakessensebecausethereshouldbeurgencyand
real order flow following the breakout. Large players should be interested in defend-
ing the breakout level, and small players should be willing—perhaps stupidly, but still
willing—to chase the market. All of this should logically result in the market being un-
abletocomebacktothebreakoutlevel.Itiseasytofindexamplesofthesepatterns,and
alsoveryeasytomanagethesetradesthatnevercomebacktotheentryprice.Figure5.4
showsschematicexamplesofthispattern.

There is an important lesson here for smaller traders: we would like clean, perfect
tradeswherethemarketalmostmagicallyrespectslineswedrawonourcharts,butthere
isnoreasonfortheworldtoworklikethis.Thereisnologicalreasonforthemarketto
have to hold outside the breakout level. If you are a breakout trader, an interesting ex-
erciseistotakeareasonablesampleoftradesinyourtimeframes(perhaps500trades),
go through them methodically, and categorize them into ones that held cleanly beyond
the breakout level and those that did not. Then ask yourself, objectively, if those that
conformed to the ideal pattern of holding outside the level performed better after the
breakout(intermsoftrendextension)thanthosethatdidnot.
There is also probably another dynamic at work here in many of these situations.
Imagine for a minute a simplified market model with only three groups of participants:
strong-hand large players who are trading on a mixture of technical and fundamental
concepts;small,nimble,butnaiveshort-termtraderswhotradeonlyoffpricelevels;and
noise traders whose random trades obscure what would otherwise be very clear in the
priceaction.Furthermore,imaginethatabreakouthasjustoccurred,inwhichthelarge
playersaccumulatedbeforethebreakout,thesmalltradersenteredonthebreakout,but,
afterthebreakout,thelargeplayerswerenotwillingtocommitenoughcapitaltopropel
the trend higher. Perhaps they had not yet accumulated their full line in the prebreak-
out level, perhaps they sold enough at the level that they wanted to buy more at lower
prices, or perhaps they were uncertain in front of some economic report. The point is
thatwedonotknowandcanneverunderstandtherealmotivationsoftheselargeplay-
ers, especially since we are presenting a composite model of what would actually be
thousandsofcompetinginterestsintheactualmarket.Regardless,thekeypointisthat
theychoose,forwhateverreasons,nottosupportthemarketanditdropsbackthrough

What do the naive short-term traders do at this point? They recognize the failed
breakout pattern and sell their positions en masse just below the breakout level. Who
isbuyingfromthem?Yougotit—thelargeplayersaremorethanhappytopickupsome

Patterns of Failed Breakouts
The preceding example is not meant to imply that every breakout trade works, nor
thatshort-termtraderswerenecessarilystupidtoexittheirtradesonafailedbreakout.
Breakoutsdofail,theyfailfrequently,andpricemovementsfollowingthesefailurescan

This may not be completely intuitive at first, but here is one way this could work.
Imagine that you are a large player who would like to sell some of your inventory in
a futures market. You can see that the market has held a resistance level cleanly (let’s
say $80.00 for this example) on several tests, and it is reasonable to assume that many
traders are short against this visible level. If so, where will those traders probably put
their stops? There is no exact level, but we can assume that they will be clustered just
beyondtheresistance,probablyintherangefrom$80.01to$80.20.Whatdoyoudothe

Failure Test of Breakout Level Again, we encounter inconsistent terminology,
as different traders will call this trade by different names. What I call a failure test is
thesimplecasejustdescribed,whereamarkettradesbeyondasignificantleveljustfar
enoughtotriggerstopswithoutanysignificantfollow-throughbeyondthelevel.Asapure
pricepattern,afailuretestisabriefexcursionbeyondalevel,followedbyanimmediate

lookingforareversalwithinsecondstominuteswhileverylong-termtradersmightcon-
sideranyactionreversedwithinafewweekstobeafailuretest.Asaworkingdefinition,
a rule of thumb might be that you want to see no more than two or three bars on your
time frame outside the breakout level and then strong momentum reversing the move.
Thisisonecasewherethecloseofthebaronyourtimeframecanbeveryimportant.
The reason for this is that lower time frame price action is the key to judging the
probabilities around this trade. Conceptually, in the case of an upside breakout, buy-
ers are swept into the market by the breakout, and then they will sell their positions
if the breakout fails. These exits are usually accompanied by some degree of urgency,
ranging from mild to outright panic, and this order flow creates downside momentum.
It is extremely unlikely to have this kind of action and not to have a close back below
the breakout level. Old-school chartists sometimes referred to this kind of action as a
“turkey shoot”—the turkey would poke its head above the level (perhaps a fencerow),
andwouldimmediatelyhaveitsheadshotoff.Thisactuallydescribesthepriceactionin
thebestexamplesofthesefailuresverywell.
In Figure 5.6, compare the price action on the two or three bars following the two
pointsmarkedAtothesametimeperiodfollowingB.Inthefirsttwocases,onceabar
closes back on the other side of the breakout level, strong momentum steps in and we
see good price rejection from the breakout level. Remember, this price rejection is the
fundamental pattern of support or resistance holding; in this case the level is holding
after being broken, but the same concepts still apply. Even though the trade marked B
would have also been a successful fade of the breakout level, the action following B
is not typical of the action following the best trades. The market spent too much time
consolidatingtoocloselytothelevel.
At the risk of confusing the issue slightly, it is important to consider that there is
anothervariationonthispatterninwhichthereversalbaractuallydoesnotshowstrong

price action shows a lack of conviction beyond the breakout level. For instance, in the
case of an upside breakout, bounces would be slow and reluctant on the lower time
frame, and the market might be seen to move down with much less resistance than
when it moves up; we would say that such a market “goes down a lot easier than it

While there have been constant reminders that nearly everything in technical anal-

a sharp reversal and failure out of the wrong side of the pullback formation, indicating
a complete failure of conviction outside the breakout level. For instance, assume that

Once a position has been established in a suspected trend termination, the first
thingtolookforisconfirmationthatthetrendhasindeedterminated.Usually,thisisnot
difficult: if an uptrend terminates, the market will stop going up, and vice versa for a
downtrend. However, this somewhat tongue-in-cheek observation ignores the cases

momentum beyond the previous trend extreme is an undeniable sign that the trend is
continuing.
Once the trend termination has been successfully identified, it is important to take
higher time frame market structure into consideration. The trading time frame trading
range will eventually terminate, but is an exit from one direction more likely than the
other? On the trading time frame and lower time frames, the range will probably be

than to trade these trends, which might offer 10 or 20 times the profit potential of any
normal scenario.) Typically, trends that end this way develop two characteristics: they

Expectations Following Parabolic Exhaustion Oncetheentryintheparabolic
expansion has been identified, it is important to start considering reasonable expecta-
tions for the trade. There is, of course, the possibility that the exhaustion will be ab-
sorbedandthemarketwillcontinueinthedirectionoftheoriginaltrend.Inthecaseof
large-scaleexhaustions,thisisveryunlikelyastheytendtocausestructuralshiftsinthe
psychologyofmarketparticipants,buttherearealsomanysmallerclimaxes,especially
onshorter timeframes, that dooftenresult incontinuation after furtherconsolidation.
One classic example is a small climax that caps a trend, resulting in a two-legged com-
plexconsolidation.Afterthisstructure,theextremeconditioncreatedbytheclimaxmay
beworkedoff,anditisquitelikelythemarketcancontinuetheoriginaltrend.Again,this
isextremelyunusualafterlargerclimaxesasinFigure5.12,but,eventhen,itispossible.
More common is the sequence of a sharp countertrend move, consolidation, and
then another sharp break in the direction of the countertrend move. This technically
completesatwo-leggedcomplexconsolidation,butthedistinguishingfactoristhatthe
countertrend momentum is much sharper than in a standard pullback. The easy trade
is usually playing for this second countertrend leg, but this is also the point where the
market may extend into a new trend. The key will be judging the bounces that are in
thedirectionoftheoriginal(preclimax)trend.Iftheyarereluctantandaresmaller,ide-

Thereisatradingrulethatsays,onlyhalfinjest,thatthemarketwillalwaysdowhatever
willhurtthegreatestnumberoftraders.Partofthisissubjective—weallusehumorto
deal withlosses at times—but there also is a reality here, driven by that core tendency
of markets to seek volume and activity. After an extended run-up followed by a well-
recognizedtoppingformation(e.g.,headandshouldersordoubletop),therewilllikely
be many traders who short in anticipation of a trend reversal with stops just beyond
the recent highs. In addition, there will be traders who think they are smarter than the
market, and who will be playing for trend continuation at these points. They too will
buy, either on stops or with contingent orders when the market violates the previous
high. Regardless of the reason behind the buying, there is almost always a lot of latent
buyingpressurewaitingjustbeyondtheprevioushighs.
Themomentoftruthcomesassoonasthemarketprobesthatarea,stopsareelected,
and the initial buying dries up. Are there larger buyers there, waiting to bid the market
higher with commitment, or was the whole move a fake-out? If the latter, this will be
obvious as prices fall back below the previous highs and many of the shorts who were

Traders who recognize this pattern early can establish short positions at advantageous
prices or at least can aggressively limit damage on long positions. Figure 5.15 shows a
fairly brutal example in Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS): after a gap up and a short
consolidation, the stock put in an upthrust at the highs. After consolidating again for
nearly a quarter, another upthrust back above the level decisively ended any hopes for
anothereasytrendlegupandthemarketgappedopenlowerthenextday.
Trend Change Without Warning
Sometimes the absence of a pattern is a pattern in itself. Trends are powerful forces
in markets, and it is very rare to see one stop and turn with no warning. Strong trends
usually require time and substantial price action to reverse, so with-trend traders are
usuallyrewardedforbeingsomewhatstubbornintheirexits.Withawinningtrendtrade,

Change of Character
Inallofthesecasesofatrendreversingintotheoppositetrend,thecommongroundis
that the market displays a distinct change of character. The pattern of the established
trendisfirstbroken,andthenanewmovementemergesthatshowsstrongmomentum
counter to the established trend. Traders who are actually watching the price bars
develop will see that price is moving differently; this is a form of tape reading. Traders
whoareonlylookingatstaticpricebars,forinstance,examiningchartsattheendofthe
day, will still be able to infer price action to some extent by carefully examining lower
timeframes.
Though this is a very important point, do not overcomplicate it. Working with the

somethinghaschanged,evenifitisstubbornlynebulousatfirst.Onceyouknowthatthe
pattern has been broken, you can dig deeper and attempt to better quantify the break.
For instance, if a market has been uptrending for quite a while, a change of character
could be as simple as a downswing that is bigger than the preceding upswing. If this is

A successful trend reversal is a trend failure: the trend fails to continue. A failed trend

and simple as possible, but there is a distinction between simple trend continuations

Practical Trading

Do not [just blindly] repeat the tactics which have gained you one
victory, but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of
circumstances.
—SunTzu,TheArtofWar(ca.210CE)
T
his chapter presents eight specific trading patterns that should be seen as guide-
lines for actual trades. They are also concrete expressions of quantifiable, di-
rectional edges in the market; they highlight points in market structure around
which there are sometimes imbalances of buying and selling pressure that can set up
profitabletradingopportunities.Thesearenotasimplesetofpatternstobememorized,
foundinthemarket,andthentradedprofitably.Wedonottradethesepatterns;wetrade
theunderlyingbuyingandsellingpressurethatsometimescreatesthesepatterns.Thisis
animportantandsubtledistinctionthatsetsmyapproachapartfromthatofmanyother
traders. There are reliable, repeatable patterns in the markets, but these patterns are
useful only inasmuch as they reveal the buying and selling pressure that shapes evolv-
ing market structure. The true value in these patterns is that they define precise points
for your entries and exits and give you tools to manage the risk in each trade, but en-
during success will follow only if these are part of a larger analytical framework that
encompasses a complete understanding of market structure, price action, and the psy-
chologicaldynamicsthatcreatethem.
Thesepatternsareintroducedinorderofcomplexity:Failuretests,thoughtheyare
aggressive countertrend trades, are clearly defined with relatively few subjective ele-
ments.Thenextthreepatternsarevariationsofpullbacks;thefirsttwoaredistinguished
bywhethertheyenterwithoragainstthedirectionoftheshort-termtrend.Thelastpull-
backpatternisthecomplex pullback,whichisoftenthesourceofconsistentlossesfor

rigidly disciplined entry at a potential trend change. Last, three variations of breakout
tradesbringuptherearandcloseoutthechapter.

Support/resistanceholdingortrendtermination.
Concept Markets probe for stop orders and activity beyond significant price levels.
Many times, there is no real conviction behind these moves, and the moves fail and re-
versequicklyoncethestopordersaretriggered.Enteringaftersuchamoveallowsfor
excellentreward/riskpotentialwithaclearlydefinedriskpoint.
Setup Themarketmustbeoverextendedorinsomewayprimedforreversal.Thebest
examples of this trade occur in mature, extended trends, and will usually be accompa-
nied by momentum divergence on the trading time frame. Another common variation
occurs in an extended consolidation just under resistance. This type of consolidation
wouldnormallyhaveahighexpectationofproducinganothertrendlegabovethatresis-
tance, so many traders are monitoring the area and will enter on a potential breakout.
Ifthisbreakoutoccursandfails,therewillbemanytrappedtraders,whichcanaddmo-
mentumtoadownsidetradeoffthatlevel.
Trigger For a short entry, the market trades above a clearly defined resistance area,
butimmediatelyreversesonthesameorthefollowingbarandclosesbackunderthere-
sistance. There can be significant volatility, volume, and activity on the breakout, but
there should be no real conviction beyond the level. Enter short on the close of the
barthatclosesbackbelowresistance.Thebuysetupisexactlysymmetrical.Figure6.1

not enough buying pressure to hold it above the resistance level and it failed on the

on the same or the next bar following the stop-out bar, will once again fall back inside
the level. Though it can be psychologically challenging to reenter immediately after a
loss, this second trade, taken on the second failure, is also an excellent entry. This is

must be aware of this possibility and must plan for this in their risk management and
positionsizing.
The second potential issue deals with managing winning trades; it is important to
consider the trade-off between high probability of a smaller profit and the lesser prob-
ability of a large payout. Some percentage of these trades will evolve into major trend
reversals; however gratifying that is, it is not the most common outcome and should
not be your expectation when trading this pattern. Many winning trades will give the
tradertheopportunitytotakesomeprofitsaroundthefirstprofittarget,atwhichpoint
the market begins consolidating or turns around and hits the stop. It is important to
strike a balance between taking sufficient early profits that the entire set of trades will
be profitable, while maintaining enough exposure that the much less common home
runsmakeasignificantcontributiontothebottomline.Thereisnoeasyanswertothis,
and the choice will depend on a large degree on the personality and inclination of the
individualtrader.

There are two ideal triggers. In the first, the market has defined a clean pullback.
Sometimes it is possible to draw a trendline on both sides of the pullback, but, barring
that, a parallel trend channel (see Chapter 3) can be used. The entry trigger is a fail-
ure of this trend line or channel, followed by an immediate reversal; that is, the line is

Setup A complex pullback is a complete ABCD trend structure itself: the first coun-

some traders will treat moves out of complex pullbacks differently than those out of

In a sense, complex pullbacks are nothing more than a category of pullbacks, so
all of the conditions for other pullback trades apply here, with one modification. It is
usually a good idea to avoid pullbacks after conditions that could indicate a buying or
selling climax. We have looked at these parabolic expansions and have seen that they

the overextension through a more extended consolidation. Normal (simple) pullbacks
do this, as they give the market time to pause and digest each trend leg. In the case
of a more serious overextension, a larger consolidation is usually required if the trend

is going to continue, and these longer consolidations often take the form of complex
consolidations.
If you see a condition that would normally eliminate the possibility of a pullback
(e.g., a buying or selling climax), a with-trend trade may still be possible following a
complex consolidation in that same area. It is often easier to evaluate the integrity of
thetrendonthehighertimeframe,asthetradingtimeframecomplexconsolidationwill

Trigger Either of the two triggers already discussed for pullbacks—entering at sup-
port or on a breakout—are valid for complex consolidations. The support play, espe-

Stop Another advantage of complex consolidations is that the stop level is more
clearly defined. In simple consolidations, it is usually a bad idea to set a stop just un-
derneath (for a long position) the consolidation area, but in complex pullbacks this is
often an excellent risk point. There certainly are variations of complex pullbacks that

question that must be considered. Assume you want to risk $10,000 on each trade, and
you just booked a $10,000 loss on a simple pullback, which, a few days later, is clearly
developing into a complex pullback. What now? There are many possible answers, but
it is important to have a clear plan before this situation is encountered. Risk manage-
ment scenarios deserve careful consideration, planning, and maybe even quantitative
modeling—thesearenotdecisionstobemadeonthefly.

FAILED BREAKOUTS

Concept Mostbreakoutsfail.
Setup When most traders think of breakout trades, they think of big, dramatic win-
ning trades, and it is not hard to find examples like this. However, the trader actually
trading breakouts quickly comes face-to-face with a harsh reality: failed breakouts are
morecommonthanwinningbreakouts.Thisisnotanindictmentofthebreakouttrading
concept, because exceptional reward/risk ratios can compensate for lower probability.

There are in fact four very significant stumbling blocks in the way

smoreinformationalwaysbetter?Sometraders,whentheyareconsideringatrade,
willusemultipleindicatorsandanalytical tools,solicitopinionsfromothertraders,
and even consider elements such as fundamentals that do not really have a bearing
on their time frame. This approach can lead to “paralysis by analysis” as so many fac-
torsareconsidered,withsomanyconflictingpointsofview,thatthetradersimplydoes
not know what to do. The justification offered for this approach is that an officer on a
battlefield would want every possible piece of information, wouldn’t he? Perhaps not.
It might be better for the decision maker to have processed intelligence from verified
and trusted sources that has already been filtered from the massive flow of raw infor-
mation. In trading, the equivalent is to focus on a few simple tools that are completely
understood—depthofinformation,ratherthanbreadth.

ProbablythemostcommonlyusedchannelsareBollingerbands,whicharesetata
multipleofthestandarddeviationofpricearoundanaverageofprice.(Defaultsettings
are usually two standard deviations around a 20-period SMA). As the market becomes
more volatile (as measured by standard deviation of price), the bands automatically
widentoaccommodatethelargerswings.MostbooksonBollingerbands(forinstance,
Kirkpatrick, 2006) claim that 68 percent of the values should fall within one standard
deviationoftheaverage,about96percentwithintwostandarddeviations,andthatvir-
tuallyallpricesshouldfallwithinthreestandarddeviations.Thoughthisclaimhasbeen
repeated in book after book, simple empirical observation shows that this is not true.
First, prices are nowhere near normally distributed, so the rule of thumb for standard
deviations does not apply; over a large sample of markets, approximately 88 percent
(not 96 percent) of closes are within two Bollinger standard deviations of a 20-period
average.Second,standarddeviationofpriceisnotameaningfulmeasure,sothewidth
oftheBollingerbandsdoesnottrackmostacceptedmeasuresofvolatilitywell.
Keltner channels were created by Chester Keltner, a grain trader in Chicago, but
mosttraderstodayuseamodificationthatisactuallymuchclosertotheStollerAverage
Range Channels (STARC).Regardlessofterminology,theadvantageofthesechannels
is that they respond to a simpler and more consistent measure of volatility: the range
of each bar. Also, since these channels use true range rather than simple range, they
canalsobeappliedtodatathatareclose-only(e.g.,economicdata,funds,orsomecal-
culated indexes). They are simple, robust, and consistent: big bars = more volatility =
wider bands, avoiding many of the potential issues with Bollinger bands. Figures 7.6

whousethesebandsmustknowhowtoadjustforthesequirks.
Whichever type of channel is used, the critical behavior occurs when the price
bars engage the bands. It is important, then, that the bands be set at a level that is
meaningful—too close and they will give insignificant signals, but too far and they are
never touched. The Keltner channels that I use are set at a level that contains between
85and90percentofalltradingactivity(therangeofthebar,notjusttheclose)acrossa

INDICATORS: MACD
One of the recurring themes of this book is that traders must have a complete under-
standingofanytooltheyuse.Itisnotconstructivetouseatoolthatissimplyamyste-
riouswigglylinewithoutreallyunderstandingwhatitissayingaboutpriceaction.With
this in mind, Appendix B takes a deep look at how the modified MACD indicator is
constructed, and how it reacts to specific price patterns. If you have background and
experience with this or a similar tool, this material may offer a new perspective on the
useofthisindicator.
Though I have found this tool useful, many traders will have other favorite indica-
tors that they will prefer to use. This is fine, and many of the applications of the mod-
ified MACD I discuss can be applied to other momentum indicators. However, be sure
youunderstandwhatyourindicatorisreallymeasuring.Ingeneral,mostindicatorsfall

Basic Interpretation of the MACD
Let’s turn our attention to some practical applications of the MACD, and how it might
be used in actual trading. Formally and precisely, the MACD measures the changes in

thatcanbeappliedtothistoolormostothermomentumindicators.
Fast Line Pop Oneofthecoreideasoftechnicalanalysis,andindeedoffundamen-
tal analysis, is that markets move to new prices in response to new information. This
movement usually takes the form of a series of alternating waves and retracements.
Simply put, a strong momentum move will usually result in another move in the same

precisely.Themostimportantconcepthereisthatmomentumprecedesprice,meaning
thatasharpmomentummoveinamarketpressingtonewhighswillusuallybefollowed
byhigherpricesafteraconsolidation,andthereverseistruetothedownside.Beclear
on this point: a momentum indicator will not somehow lead prices—this is not possi-
ble because the indicators are calculated from past prices. There are no true leading
indicators in technical analysis; what does lead price is a strong move in the market it-
self,notthereadingonanindicator.
One of the simplest ways to use a momentum indicator is to look for it to make
a significant new high or low, and then to enter the pullback following that new mo-
mentum extreme. One complication is that the MACD is an unbounded indicator, so it
is not possible to set fixed reference levels. In practice, it is enough to use rough intu-
itive guidelines created by comparing the indicator to its own recent history. A more
systematicapproachcould,forinstance,expresstheindicator’svalueasapercentileof
alook-backwindow,andperhapsenterretracementsfollowinganexcursionintoeither
the top or the bottom decile. If you are just starting to look at this indicator, use the
40-bar history as a starting point, but you should be able to read the indicator without

Slope of the Slow Line So far, our attention has focused on the fast line of the
MACD,andforgoodreason.Mosttradersfindthatnearlyallofthevalueoftheindicator
isinthefastline,buttheslowlinecanalsoprovideanotherusefullayerofinformation.
The slow line is nothing more than a 16-period simple moving average of the fast line,
so it has all of the quirks and idiosyncrasies of any moving average. In the MACD, the
slopeoftheslowlineisagoodproxyforintermediate-termmomentum,perhapsover10
to20bars.Atfirstglance,theslowlineappearstohavelessnoiseandfewerfalsemoves

after the slow line turned down would have been frustrated as the market entered a
more extended period of consolidation. Consider this to be, for practical purposes, a
form of momentum divergence. After a period of time, the divergence works itself off
andthetrendisfreetocontinueintheoriginaldirection.Thiscommonlyoccurslaterin
anextendedtrend,andisoftenaccompaniedbyacomplexconsolidationonthechart.
Position of the Slow Line The position of the slow line relative to the zero refer-
encelineisalsosignificant.Ononehand,itisnothingmorethanatypeoftrendindicator.
Since the slow line is an average of the fast line, for the slow line to be far above zero,

On the other hand, disagreement between the fast and slow lines can highlight or

MULTIPLE TIME FRAME ANALYSIS
Multiple time frame analysis provides another layer of depth and richness to market
analysis. It can place patterns in one time frame in the context of other time frames to
better identify those spots where the patterns are more likely to have arisen due to an
actualimbalance inthemarketratherthanasaresultofrandom chance. Manytraders

a very short time frame, for instance, 1- or 3-minute charts, and other times when the
most important factor might be a level that is visible on weekly or monthly charts. We
can usually identify a dominant structure or set of structures on one time frame, and
can often watch as control is essentially passed from one time frame to another. For
instance, perhaps a resistance level is tested multiple times on the 1-minute chart, and
then is broken cleanly with a clear consolidation just below the level. At this moment,

structure. This discussion could apply without any loss of generality to daily/weekly/
monthly or to any other set of time frames, but the most important point is to avoid
that naive assumption that higher time frames are always more important. Work in-
stead to identify the dominant technical structures and to understand what time frame
hascontrol.

The situation is complicated further because much of the written material on this
subject lacks clarity. The trend seems to be either toward indicator-based oversimplifi-
cation(e.g.,lookforlongtradeswhileanindicatorappliedtoahighertimeframeshows
that the higher time frame is in an uptrend) or toward obfuscation and confusion. Nei-
ther is good. Multiple time frame trading cannot easily be reduced to a simple rule set,
but there are some commonalities and structures that occur over and over again. This
section examines a few recurrent patterns and concepts, and lays a foundation for fur-
therexploration.
Lower Time Frame Structures within Higher Time

short. True, this was not the best possible trade setup, but the market had just com-

evidence to negate a potential short setup on the lower time frame. In this case, a set
of conditions that might not have fully supported a long entry were enough to justify
not taking a potential short setup. Second, most of the trades that are contradicted by
higher time frames are also not excellent setups on one time frame. To some extent,

though the presence of a selling climax, indicated by the overextension past the lower

In a situation like this, you may still choose to take the short trade, but you have
to realize that the character of the trade, especially if you are wrong, will be different.

HigherTimeFrameDrivestoTargets Ingeneral,marketstendtowardefficiency,
and random walk prevails most of the time; when markets are more predictable, it is
usually in short spurts of activity, which can sometimes be identified through specific
patternsinprices.Onecommonareaofamorepredictablespurtoccurswhenapattern
has broken into a move to a target—for instance, on the drive out of a consolidation
pattern or following a strong break of support or resistance. These situations are not
that common, but recognizing that a scenario like this is in play can lend support to
otherwise uninteresting lower time frame patterns. Consider Figure 7.28, which shows
severalsmallconsolidationsonthedailychartofFinisarCorporation(NASDAQ:FNSR).
These are perfectly acceptable consolidations (the first is an Anti, and the second is a
simplebearflag),buttheweeklychartprovidedstrongtailwindsforthesepatternsand
madethemmuchmoreattractivethantheymighthavebeenontheirown.
Another possible use of this concept is to monitor evolving price action on lower
time frames while a trade is underway on the trading time frame. If consolidation pat-
terns resolve in the intended direction of the trade, all is well. If the trade should fail,
it will usually do so through a failure of one of these lower time frame patterns. Being
abletoreadevolvingpriceactionandmarketstructureonthelowertimeframecanof-
ten provide excellent exits from trades, but it is necessary to balance this new layer of
informationagainstthepossibilityofbeingoverlyreactivetoinsignificantnoise.

timeframecharts.
Timing Entries from the Lower Time Frame There have been hints of using
the lower time frame to find exact entry points in the previous section. For instance,
an alert trader could have used the tests of support and resistance on the higher time
frames in Figures 7.29 and 7.30 to enter at the beginning of strong trends on the lower
time frame. This is a general plan for a powerful way to use the lower time frame as a
timingtoolintohighertimeframepatterns:atimportantstructuralpointssuchastests
of support/resistance or previous pivots on the higher time frame. Think of it like this:
If you stand on a chair and step off, you will very predictably fall a short distance and
hit the floor—no big deal. All other things being equal, this is what breakouts on any
timeframearelike;anequilibriumlevelisdisturbedandapredictablemoveofmoderate

ReadingPriceActiononLowerTimeFrames Anotherwaytousethelowertime
frameistoadddepthandrichnesstomarketstructureonthetradingtimeframe.Traders
whoarewatchingorderflowandmonitoringmarketscloselyduringthetradingsession
usually develop an intuitive sense for price action in those markets. However, there is
a practical limit to how many markets can be followed this way, and some traders will
beunabletodevotefullattentiontopriceactionwhilemarketsareopen.Averyskilled
intraday trader might be able to track two dozen markets reasonably closely, but most
traders, especially developing traders, will find it difficult to monitor more than half a
dozen at a time. In addition, many traders prefer to trade higher time frames, and they

Trade Management
Choicesarethehingesofdestiny.
—Pythagoras
T
rademanagementiswhatyoudoafteryougetintothetrade.Thesedecisionsare
complicated because they deal both with mathematical realities and with trader
psychology. One thing that you’ll often hear is that it’s your responsibility, as the
trader, to find your own right way to trade. The implication is that basically anything
works; you just have to make some choices from the giant menu of possibilities, ex-
periment until they feel right, and then stick with them. There is some truth here, in
thatanyrulesetmustbematchedtothetrader’spersonalityandpsychologicalmakeup,
but there is also a very important point that goes unsaid: it is exceedingly difficult to
find an edge in the market. You must understand the impact of every decision and
everyadjustment.
Considerthesimplecaseofaspecifictradingpatternthathasanedgeinpredictinga
smalldirectionalmovementoverthenextfewbars.TradersAandBdecidetotradethis
pattern, but they both realize the importance of adapting it to their personalities. Let’s
simplify the problem they face, and consider only the choices in exiting at a profit and

PLACING THE INITIAL STOP
The placement of the initial stop is very important. First, it sets the ultimate risk point
on the trade and so removes much of the emotion from the trade process. This point
is also important because many traders will use this risk to set the trade size in a risk
management/positionsizingplan(seeChapter9).Fromtheoutset,considerthatthereis
anunavoidabletrade-offbetweennearandfarstops.Closerstopsallowlargerpositions,
which,ofcourse,meanslargerprofitsonwinningtrades,whilefartherstopswillresult

Fixed-Percentage Stops
Old-schoolstocktraders,inparticular,tendtodothis:simplygetintoapositionandgive
it10percentor20percentpricemovementagainstyou.Thereisonegoodthingtosay
aboutthisapproach:itdoesdefineafixedandclearhardlosslimit.Itisfarbettertohave
one,evenifitisanotverywell-thought-outlevel,thantohavenoneatall.However,using
the same fixed percentage across different markets is not optimal. Most importantly,
different markets trade with very different volatility levels. For instance, most actively
traded stocks trade with an average daily range that is a little under 3 percent of their
stockprice(basedon500activestocksasofApril1,2011),butmanyhaveamuchlarger
average range that is 9 percent or more of their underlying price. Using a 10 percent
stop on two markets, one with 9 percent average daily range and one with 3 percent
averagedailyrange,willgiveverydifferentresults;forthefirstmarket,a10percentstop
iswithinthepotentialnoiselevelofasingletradingdaysoprobablydoesnotrepresent
anintelligentstoppoint.Usingafixed-percentage stopisbetterthannostopatall,but
notthatmuchbetter.
Volatility-Based Stops
A simple refinement would be to use a percentage stop that is based on some measure
ofthemarket’svolatility.Forinstance,atradermightuseastopthatwasN timesamar-
ket’s average daily range, or N times a single-day one standard deviation move. Stops
for volatile markets will naturally be much farther away from the entry price, so posi-
tionsizeswillbesmallerinvolatilemarkets;stopscalculatedinthiswayautomatically
respectthenaturalswingsofeachindividualmarket.Thesecanbeusefulstopsfordis-
cretionarytraders,andoftenareidealinitialstopsforalgorithmictradingsystems.

SETTING PRICE TARGETS
To set or not to set price targets, that is the question. Many traders prefer to not set
pricetargetsinanefforttofollowthemaxim“letyourwinnersrun.”Othertradersmake
thecogentargumentthatfixedprofittargetsareeasytotestinthecontextofatrading
system, and that smaller profits can be taken with a degree of regularity. Compared to
the multiple trade management decisions that may go into an open-ended trade, it is
relativelyeasytoquantifyandtestasystemwithfixedprofittargetsandfixedstops,and
suchasystemmaybeamenabletoanoptimizedsizingstrategy.Thereisvalueinbothof
theseperspectives,andsometradersevencombinethetwobytakingpartialprofitsata

In general, there are two approaches to getting out of profitable trades: with or
against the trend of the trade. With-trend exits (i.e., selling into strength or covering
into weakness) are usually done via limit orders and are often done at preset targets.
Countertrend exits are usually done after some kind of give-back rule is activated and
thetradehasretreatedfromitsmaximumprofitpoint.Let’sconsiderafewvariationsof
profit-takingstrategies.
Fixed Profits at Risk Multiples
Iftheinitialriskisalwaysknownatthetimeoftradeentry,wecanusemultiplesofthat
risk for profit targets. This is my personal approach: I usually exit between 25 and 33
percent of the position on a limit order at a profit equal to my initial risk in the trade.
Forinstance,ifIambuyinga$50stockwitha$45stopandmypositionsizingruleshave
mebuying10,000shares,Iwillofferoutbetween2,500and3,000ofthosesharesat$55.

usuallydonotwanttoworkstopordersinpremarketandpostmarkethours,astheycan

benefit to your profit-taking orders. As much as possible, you want these profit-taking
limitorderstobeworkinginovernight,thinmarkets,becausesometimesothertraders

In addition, orders are prioritized in most electronic trading books in the order in
which they are received. If there are 25,000 shares bid at a price and you join the bid
for 500 shares, you will not be filled until 25,500 shares print at that price. However,
modern order books have a tremendous amount of cancel-and-replace activity due to
thepresenceofhigh-frequencyelectronictradingalgorithms.Mostofthose25,000shares

Market Structure Targets
A good argument can be made for putting profit targets at visible points in the market.
Youshouldgenerally assumethatyourlimitorderwillhavetobetradedthroughtobe
filled. In other words, a limit to sell at $10.00 will certainly not be filled if the highest
price is $9.99, and, in backtesting, you should assume it will not be filled even if a lot
of volume trades at $10.00. However, in most electronic markets, you are guaranteed
to be filled if price trades to $10.01, as this cannot happen until all liquidity (including
yourlimitorder)istakenat$10.00.Becauseofthis,itmakessensetoplaceyourlimits
slightlyinsidetheactualpointinthemarket;ifthereisclearlyvisiblesupportat$10.00
andresistanceat$20.00,youwouldplacealimittobuyabove$10.00(perhapsbetween
$10.01 and $10.15, depending on the market and your time frame) and a limit to sell
somewhere below $20.00. If you are a daytrader looking to take profits at the high of
theday,yourprofit-takingordershouldbeafewcentsorticksbelowthehigh.Itrarely

countingonextravolatilityfromstopordersbeinghitinthoseareas.Thisisanobvious
but often-overlooked point, and is something to consider if you tend to trade around
thosechartpatterns.
It is not possible to create a comprehensive list of every chart structure that may
provide a reasonable profit target, nor is it necessary to do so. Many are obvious: visi-
blesupportorresistance;visiblesupportorresistanceonahighertimeframe;bighighs
and lows like important 52-week highs and lows for stocks or contract highs and lows
for commodities; high and low of the session for intraday trades; long shadows of ac-
cumulation below ranges or distribution above; and so on. In most cases, it is enough
to be aware of the market structure as delineated by the pivot highs and lows of the
swings.Don’toverthink.Ifyounormallytakeprofitsatriskmultiplesandfindyourself

Trailing Stops
Many traders use some type of trailing stop approach to winning trades. Though there
aremanyvariationsonthisconcept,theyalldefinestoplevelsthatmovewiththetrade
accordingtosomeruleset.Theymayadjustveryinfrequentlyaccordingtosimplerules.
For instance, a trader taking profits at 1× the initial risk on the trade might then move
thestopfortheremainderofthepositiontoahigherprice,effectivelylockinginaprofit
on the trade. There are also many more complex, algorithmic rules for trailing stops
that adapt to market conditions as the trade develops. Let’s look at some variations of
theserules.
Moving Averages and Trend Lines Manytraderswillgetintoatrendingtradeand
willthenstopoutwhenpricetouchesor,insomecases,closesbelowamovingaverage.
Traders often use 100-, 50-, or 20-period moving averages, but we have to ask: why not
103, 98, 49, or 17 periods? Why not 53? The choice of which moving average to use is
arbitrary, and so the moving averages in general are arbitrary. Using a moving average
for a stop is better than having no plan at all, but moving averages usually make poor
choicesforstoplevels.
Anothercommonlyusedplanisastopbelowanimportanttrendline.Thereissome
logictothisidea,buttherearealsosomeseriousflaws.First,trendlinesareunavoidably

when these trend linebreaks arereversed, so why choose astopplan thatputs you on
the wrong side of that tendency? If you want to use a trend line as a trailing stop, it
mightmakesensetorequiresignificantpriceactionunderthetrendline.Howyoudefine
significant price action is up to you: multiple closes, consolidation under, multiple legs
under, are all possibilities, but they all require price movement and leave the position
opentolargerlosses.Again,therearebettertoolsfortrailingstops.

and then placing a stop a certain distance from that extreme point. Each day, the stop
ismovedclosertothatextremepointbyanamountcalledtheacceleration factor;this
factor also increases every day so the stop is ratcheted in at an ever-increasing rate. If
the market trends strongly, the Parabolic stop level will trail behind, but if the market

ittoartificialdataseriesyoucreate(seeChapter7)sothatyoucanseehowitreactsto
everyimaginablemarketsituation.
A similar idea is found in Chuck LeBeau’s chandelier stop, which basically hangs
a stop a fixed number of ATRs from the extreme point of a trend, creating a stop level
thatiscomceptuallysimilartotheParabolicwithouttheaccelerationfactor.Oneofthe
problems with using the Parabolic on a strict, systematic basis is that the acceleration
factorisconstantlymovingthestopclosertothemarket,evenwhenthereisnotrendat

usually tighten stops dramatically compared to the chandelier stop, which may help to

Other Price Action/Market Structure Stops Itisalsopossibletousereferences

mightbetostopoutofanuptrendingmarketonthefirstdownclose,atthelowestlow
of three days ago, or on two consecutive downward closes. If you are going to explore
these, also consider stops that limit your loss on any one day, perhaps stopping out a
certainATRmultiplefromthepreviousday’shigh,low,orclosingvalues,andbecertain
that you understand the statistical tendencies supporting your stop plan. For instance,
all other things being equal, stopping out after three consecutive downward closes in
stocks would be a bad plan because the market is usually primed for a bounce at that
point.Whateveryouchoosetodo,itshouldbesubjectedtoabatteryofstatisticaltests

you have used other techniques to enter and to manage the initial stages of a trade,
but, at that point, we need to ask if these stops really add anything at all. The answer
will be different for different traders at different stages of their development. My ex-
perience is that good discretionary traders will outperform any rule-based trailing stop
methodology over a large set of trades. There will be exceptions, but discretionary
traders will know when to stop out of trades before the rule-based level is reached, or

240 TRADINGSTRATEGIES
ACTIVE MANAGEMENT
Many trading systems are designed with fixed profit targets and loss limits that are en-
teredatthetimeofthetradeandnotmodifieduntiloneishitandtheotheriscanceled,
and others use various combinations of dynamic levels calculated from tools like the
ParabolicSAR.Thesearecertainlyvalidapproachestotrademanagement,butmostdis-
cretionary traders will gravitate toward a more active style that allows them to make
decisionswhilethetradeisunderway.Thisis,infact,oneofthemainreasonsforbeing
a discretionary trader, but it raises some questions. First, are we adding value through
this interaction? Psychological studies have shown that people performing a task with
a random reward falsely attribute more of their results to their skill if they have more
chancestointeractwiththeprocess.Thedesignersofslotmachinesandrub-offlottery

Taking Partial Profits
Taking partial profits as the trade moves in your favor can make good sense; you are
paying yourself as the market proves your trade idea correct. There is an unavoidable
trade-off: taking partial profits will mean that you do not have your full size on for the
tradesthatbecomebigwinners,sothetrade-offisconsistencyattheexpenseoflarger,
butlessfrequent,wins.Inthecontextofawell-plannedtradingprogram,eitherapproach
is viable. Some traders feel the need for activity, and will start exiting part of their po-
sitions without any plan soon after entry. If this is not well thought out, what usually
happens is that these early exits simply remove some of the edge from winning trades,
asthenaturalpsychologicaltendencywillbetolockinsomeprofits,howeversmall,on

should have profited, but notice that partial profits taken on either side of the line that
defines the entry price will tend to anchor the P&L on that side of the line. Locking in
losses makes it very difficult to ever recover those losses. If you are ever considering
taking partial exits at a loss, it may make sense to simply exit the entire position at a
small loss rather than deleveraging your P&L in the loss space. Use this tool to visual-
ize various scenarios and their impact on your bottom line, and carefully consider the

playing for is the slight statistical edge that may come from the rule set, and some of
these conditions have fairly limited influence with respect to both time (i.e., they are
good for only a few bars) and price (small price movements). A trader working with a
systemlikethis,orwithadiscretionaryapproachthatissimilar,willfindthataddingto

thing as an entry that requires scaling in to reach full size as the market moves against
theentryprice.

gets into a trade, takes half of it off at a 1X profit (where X is the initial dollar amount
riskedonthetrade)andthenfindsthetradebackattheentryprice.Thistradercanadd

Another case to consider is where a trader gets lucky and catches a well-trending

are opportunities to reap truly outsized profits from extended trends with the proper

Time Stops
Few technical traders get into a position with the plan of the market simply staying at
their entry price. (The obvious exception would be option spreads or other derivatives
thatareshortvolatility.)Thechoicetoactuallyenteratradeisusuallymadebecausewe
believe that an imbalance exists in the market and that this imbalance should cause a
price movement within a short time period. If this movement does not happen quickly,
it often suggests that much of the edge has gone out of the trade, and we are basically
flipping a coin. This is why time stops can make sense. There are many variations of
theserules,buttheybasicallysaythatifatradedoesnothitsomekindofpredetermined
profitlimitwithinacertaintime,thetradewillbeexitedafterthattimewindowexpires.
Time stops will also cut out some winning trades. This is unavoidable, but, even with
the loss of some winners, the end result could still be a net gain to the bottom line. In
addition, many traders find that their best trades work right away; this is a reflection
of certain setups in certain markets and may not generalize to all situations. For these

There is a trade-off between staying in a trade for the bigger move, which requires
looser stops, and being unwilling to give back much profit with tighter stops. Traders

Trade Reaches a Risk Multiple Target For many technical traders, once the
trade has made a significant move into the profit zone, it rarely makes sense to take a
full-sized loss on the trade. Traders can use their initial risk level as a reference point,

The parabolic trend is an unusual and dramatic example, but even normal trends
canoftenjustifyfairlytightstops,dependingonthetrader’splanandpersonality.Swing
traders, who are clearly playing for only one swing with minimal giveback, will work
much tighter stops than traders who plan to hold for the longer trend, if it should de-

It Is Difficult to Tighten Stops Against a Range Ifitiseasytoworktightstops

tend to be much more random, and one of the dominant features of these structures is
that they have large spikes outside the range. Volume and liquidity tend to be lower in

can have a very large impact on prices. Be aware that tightening stops on a trade in

Widening Stops
The rules for this technique can be simplified to one word: don’t. Most traders will be
better off if they have a simple rule that says they will never move a stop in the direc-
tion of risk. In other words, never move a stop down in a long position or higher in a
shortposition.Fornewtrades,thereasonisobvious:Atradeisinitiatedagainstafixed

rules for position sizing, initial risk, and initial stop placement if you do not intend to
followthem?
I actually have a trading rule that says a stop can never be moved in the direction
of risk, but there are two precisely defined exceptions to that rule. In both cases, the
common factor is that the stop must remain inside the initial 1× risk parameter; this
is a hard limit established at the time of trade entry that can never be violated. The
exceptionsare:

Managing Gaps Beyond Stops
Though many markets are moving toward round-the-clock trading, there are still cases
where a market will gap open beyond a stop level. For instance, overnight news could
cause a stock to open much lower, gapping under a stop on a long position. In a more
dramatic example, a natural catastrophe could trigger a large shift in markets, causing
many positions to gap beyond stop levels. In these cases, the initial losses on the open
maybemanytimestheintendedriskonthetrade.Nodoubtthiseventisadisaster,but
the damage can get much worse. It is important to have a good plan that accounts for
these possibilities, so that you are not put in the position of having to make emotional
decisionsonthefly.
Therearetwoimportantfactorstoconsiderhere.Understandyourchosenmarkets’
tendenciesaroundtheopen.Forinstance,mostgapsinequitiesarereversed;ifastock
opens down, there is a good tendency for it to trade up into the gap. Second, consider
the markets’ tendencies in trading off the open print. The high or low of the day tends
tobe set in early trading. So, if you are holding a long position that gaps down and im-
mediatelystartstradingup,itmaymakesensetosetanewstopundertheday’slowto
give the market a chance at recovery. However, if the market opens down and imme-
diately presses lower, or breaks lower out of an opening range, there is a good chance
that it could trend down all day. Long positions should be dumped immediately in the
secondscenario.

PORTFOLIO CONSIDERATIONS
Activetradersdonotusuallythinkintermsofbuildingportfolios,buttherealityisthat
any set of assets held at the same time in an account will behave as a portfolio. Much
ofthemathandmanyoftheassumptionsofmodernportfoliotheory(MPT)areflawed,
but investors and managers who are used to thinking in terms of portfolios usually in-
ternalizesomesenseoftherisksandpeculiarbehaviorsofportfolios.(MPTwascreated
in 1952, so calling it modern is a bit of a misnomer.) Active traders may not have the
sameintuition,buttheseareimportantfactorsthatcansubstantiallyalterthetotalriska
traderisexposedto.Anytimemultiplepositionsareheld,evenforafewminutes,some
oftheseportfolioconsiderationsapply.
Correlated Positions
That correlated positions will tend to move together is obvious, but many people are
notawareofhowunstablecorrelationscanbe.Correlationsbetweendiverseandseem-
inglyunrelatedmarketsalltendtomovetoward1.0intimesoffinancialstressorcrisis.
The traditional defense to correlation is diversification—holding many different assets
with varying degrees of correlation so that losses in one asset class over a time pe-
riodarecushionedbygainsinanother.However,long-terminvestorshavebeentaught
this important lesson time and time again: the supposed benefits of diversification are
not there when they are most needed. An investor holding long equities, U.S. dollars,
bonds, gold, crude oil, cocoa, and wheat would normally expect that some pieces of
that portfolio are uncorrelated and some are usually negatively correlated. If the mar-
kets go into crisis mode, there will be periods when every asset in that portfolio loses
value at the same time. In addition, correlations shift over time, both as a function
of random noise and due to longer-term structural influences. Changes in correlations
present a serious challenge to managers and investors who would build portfolios de-
signedtoweathertheroughtimes;robustportfolioconstructionisalotharderthanmany
peoplethink.
Short-term traders often tend to ignore correlations, assuming that whatever posi-
tionstheyhaveonaredrivenbypriceactiondynamicsthatareuniquetoeachofthose
markets. This is often true, but, when it is not, the losses can be catastrophic. Stock
traders, in particular, do not have as many positions as they think. If you are an equity
trader,considerthesumoftheopenrisksinallofyourpositionsandaskifyouwould
takeequivalentriskinalargesinglepositioninanindexproduct.Theanswer,inalmost
all cases, will be no, but in reality, this is what you are doing. It’s very simple: if the
market makes a big move, your positions are going to move together. You will win or
lose on the long and short sides of your book as two large blocks, regardless of what
diversificationyouthoughtyouhadbuiltintotheequation.
Forfuturesandforextraders,thesituationisusuallyalittlelesscomplicated,though
traders need to be aware of shifting correlations and unexpected influences in shocks.

Maximum Portfolio Risk
If you trade long enough, everything that can happen eventually will happen. It is also
important to have a rule that limits the total amount of the damage that can be done
to your account on any one day, assuming that every long and every short position hit
their designated loss limit for that day. In reality, this may happen once every 5 or 10
years, but the psychological and financial impact of taking a 50 percent hit in a single
day is irrecoverable. One way to deal with this kind of tail risk is simply to limit the

254 TRADINGSTRATEGIES
Monitoring Tools
Another point to consider is how often you will look at your positions. If you are an
intraday trader, you must be present at the screen every moment of the trading day.
You will eat lunch at the screen and will reduce your break time to the bare minimum
necessary for taking care of bodily functions, and there willbe days you willeven skip
those. One of the advantages of being a trader with a longer time horizon is that it is
acceptable to monitor your positions less frequently. For instance, a two-day to two-
week swing trader can legitimately check in on her positions two or three times a day,
perhapsontheopenandagainneartheclose,ifthereisasysteminplaceformonitoring
and catching unusual moves in her markets. Longer-term investors may well check in
on their portfolios once a week, but it still behooves them to check daily for large and
unusual moves in their holdings or in related markets. It is much easier to do this with
somebasicinfrastructureinplacetosupportthesefunctions.

The most obvious screen is one that is probably provided by your brokerage soft-

P&L in three pieces: the day’s change or P&L marked from the previous close, any
closed P&L related to the position, and the total P&L from inception. Some of this

can choose to be either a price maker or a price taker—to add or take liquidity from
the book. Particularly for very short-term traders who do a lot of volume, the rebates
associated with adding liquidity to the book can help to offset a significant portion of
their transaction costs, so it makes sense for these traders to execute on limit orders,
addingliquidityasoftenaspossible.However,itisalsoimportanttoconsidertheadverse

Risk Management
Itisimportanttoseedistantthingsasiftheywerecloseandtotakea
distancedviewofclosethings.
—MiyamotoMusashi,TheBookofFiveRings(1645CE)
M
any of the problems of trading reduce to risk management. In most styles of
trading,thetrader’sjobisessentiallytomanagetheriskintrades,focusingon
exiting losing trades at the correct points, and letting the upside take care of
itself. Risk management is critical, as a few outsized losses can offset the profits from
many winning trades; it does not take many errors to completely erode a trading edge.
This chapter considers risk management from both practical and theoretical perspec-
tives.Webeginwithpractical,appliedtoolsforriskmanagementandpositionsizingthat
tradersinalltimeframeswillfinduseful.Manylargelossescomefromhavingtradeswith
inappropriatepositionsizes,andmanytradersdonotunderstandtheimpactoftrading
size on the bottom line. The chapter moves on to a higher-level perspective on risk, in-
corporatingsomeideasfrommodernacademicthinkingandfocusingonafewspecific
measures of risk, before concluding with a look at some of the less common risks that
self-directedtradersoftenoverlook.
RISK AND POSITION SIZING
From a practical perspective, there are three main questions to answer with respect to
risk.Thefirsttwohavebeenaddressedinthepreviouschapter,butthethirdissupremely
important:
1. Wheredoweplaceourinitialexitorders,bothforprofitsandlosses?
2. Howdoweadjustthetradeasitdevelopsthroughtime?

%R and Position Sizing
Once this initial price movement risk level is known, the question of trading size must
alsobeaddressed.Thereisalargebodyofliteraturethatdealswiththetheoreticalideas
behind asset allocation and position sizing for individual traders. For the most part we
will avoid these discussions and will simply limit discussion here to two points: some
practical guidelines I have used with success in my own trading and an illustration of
whyconsistentsizingisimportant.
ManytradersarefamiliarwiththeKellycriterion,whichisaformulathatgivesthe

The Kelly criterion and Vince’s extension of it, called optimal f, are optimized ap-
proaches. In both cases, the objective is to maximize the geometric growth rate of the
accountwhileminimizingtheriskofruin,oracatastrophiclossofequity.Mostoptimized
approaches like this are extremely aggressive, and large drawdowns must be accepted
asamatterofcourse.Inaddition,andmuchmoreseriously,thetheoreticalassumptions
behind these models are important and they rarely hold up in short-term trading. For
instance, most optimized methods assume that each trade is independent of any other
trade,butmanytradingsystemsexperiencestringsofwinsandlosseswhilethemarket

degreeofserialdependence.Furthermore,manyoftheseoptimizedapproachesrequire

alldependentontheassumptionthatfutureresultswilllooklikethepast.Ifyouexperi-
encealargerlossinthefutureandyouareusinganaggressive,optimizedposition-sizing
methodology, you could be in trouble. If you are going to use any of these approaches
in actual trading, make sure you understand the assumptions and the risks involved in
violatinganyofthoseassumptions.
Many traders find that the risks under an optimized position-sizing scheme are too
greattobear.Anotherpossibilitycouldbetosetasideafixedpercentageofyourtrading
capital, and apply aggressive sizing rules to that portion while trading the remainder
moreconservatively.Ifyoudecidetodothis,youshouldcarefullyconsiderwhetherthe

FixedFractionalApproaches Myapproachtopositionsizingissimpleandrobust.
It is not an optimized method, nor is it meant to be. Rather, it is designed to do a few
specificthings:

Drawdown usually refers to the amount an equity curve, whether for a trader, sys-
tem, or fund, has retreated from its peak. Drawdowns are a fact of life; there is always
some natural fluctuation in an equity curve. Later in this chapter, we examine many of
thetraditionalmeasuresofriskandfindthemwantingononeleveloranother.Itiseasy
tomakeanargumentthatdrawdownisoneofthebestandoneofthetruestmeasuresof
risk, but, like many other elements of trading performance, future drawdowns must be
extrapolated from history. If something changes in the future, the disconnect between
historicalperformanceandwalk-forwardprojectioncancausetradersandmanagersto
dramaticallyunderestimaterisk.
RecoveringfromDrawdowns
Oneofthemathematicalrealitiestradersfaceistheasymmetrybetweendrawdownsand
thepercentagereturnsneededtorecover.Forsomepeople,thisisnotalwaysintuitiveat
first glance—for any given percent drawdown, it takes a much larger percentage return
to recover. For any drawdown of D%, the return needed to bring the account back to
breakevenmaybecalculatedfromthisformula:
D%
Returnneededforrecovery=
(1−D%)
For small drawdowns, the return needed to recover is only very slightly larger. For
instance,a5percentdrawdownrequiresa5.3percentreturntorecover,butatraderin
a 20 percent drawdown needs to make 25 percent just to break even. For larger draw-
downs, the hole gets deeper very quickly—you would have to double your money, with
a 100 percent return, to get back to even from a 50 percent drawdown. To put these
numbersinperspective,veryfewtradersmake25percentayearwithanyregularity,and

orsystemswillhavemoreorlessclearlydefinedstoppoints.Ifyouwanttoriskmoreor

Assumeyouaretradinga$100,000accountandyouwanttorisk1percentoneach
trade.
(cid:2)
Assume you find a trade to go long a $50.00 stock with a stop loss at $47.50. The
difference between the entry and the initial stop is the per-unit risk that the trade
requires:pershare,percontract,perdollar,andsoonforeachrespectivemarket.
(cid:2)
Thequestionishowmanysharestotradesothatalossatthemarketpriceof$47.50
willequalalossof1percentofthe$100,000account.
Tradesize=Desireddollarrisk÷Per-unitrisk
In this case, we want to risk 1 percent of $100,000, or $1,000 on each trade, so
$1,000÷$2.50=400shares.
Thinking in R multiples Thisinitialriskisveryimportantbecauseitisthebasefor
the R multiple for the entire trade. Many traders will find it productive to think of all
P&L generated by the trade in terms of this initial R multiple. For instance, if the trade

of thepressure of thinking about actual money. Many developing traders find that they

morelikelytothinkofthemoneyasanabstractionor,insomecases,almostmoreofa

Traders also sometimes have trouble increasing their trading size because of the
growing nominal risk. This is a problem for the individual self-directed trader, but can
also be a problem on the institutional scale when new client funds come in. There is a
big difference psychologically between risking $10,000 on a position and $100,000, but

The Effect of Position Sizing
Evaluating the effectiveness of a position-sizing strategy is difficult because doing so
requires a good understanding of probabilities in highly path-dependent situations. It
is extremely difficult to build intuition in these scenarios, and it is very easy to make
mistakes—wearenotnaturallywiredtothinkaboutissueslikethis.MonteCarlometh-
odsprovideausefulframeworkforevaluatingdifferentstrategies.Let’sdoasimplified

Let’s further assume that you will trade this system for 250 consecutive trades, at
whichpointyouwillstopandevaluateyourresults.Itisimportanttorememberthatyour
actual P&L was just one realization of a nearly limitless set of possibilities. This is one
reasonthatwehavetroublethinkinginprobabilities:probabilitiesaremeaningfulovera

ofonespecificoutcome.Itiseasytofocusonthatoneresultandnottorealizethatitis
oneofmanypossibilitiesand,insomecases,mayevenbeahighlyimprobableoutcome.
Our behavior and decisions must be governed by the most probable outcomes. Monte
Carlo modeling or simulation can be a useful tool to help build intuition about these
path-dependentsituations.Eachpathontheteststhatfollowrepresentstheoutcomeof
onetraderexecutingthese250tradesinarow;wewillrepeatthetestforeachof1,000

traders working in parallel universes, since it is difficult to imagine one trader trading
thesystem1,000times.Last,mostMonteCarlotestsarerunonmuchlargernumbers(by
severalpowersof10).Thoughthesmallsetsusedheremaynotbebigenoughtoassure
convergencetotheoreticalvalues,theyarelargeenoughtoillustratetherelevantpoints.
So you have this system that you know has a positive expectancy, and you will be
trading it in a $100,000 trading account. The only question left is how much to risk on
eachtrade;youhavetostartsomewhere,solet’sbeginbyrisking$2,000oneachtrade.

beattheendoftherun?
We can answer this by using the expected value of the system, which is 0.1 in this
case. This means that, for every dollar wagered, we expect to make $0.10 per trade.

values are normally distributed. (Though not necessary in the context of Monte Carlo
modeling,itpaystocheckassumptionsofnormalityasamatterofcourse.Inthiscase,
they are, in fact, normally distributed.) The coefficient of variation is not particularly
meaningful in this one case, but it gives us a quick tool to make risk-adjusted compar-
isonsacrossdifferentscenarios.
Make sure you understand the mean of maximum and mean of minimum terminal
values:theaverageofthehighestandlowestpointsreachedbyeachofthe1,000acounts
over250independenttradesrisking$2,000pertrade.Theseareaverages,andtherewill
certainly be surprising deviations, especially in a larger number of trials. For instance,
inthis test we had one run in which the account balance reached $12,400 at one point.
(Thisisnotvisibleinthetablebecausetheaccountrecoveredsignificantlybytheendof
that specific trial.) At this point you should be saying something like, “What? I thought
weweretradingsomethingthathasapositiveexpectancy.”Yes,thisisasimplesystem
with a clear positive expectancy, but one trader trading it would have experienced an
87.5percentdrawdown,purelyduetotheslingsandarrowsofoutrageousfortune!This
isanimportantrealitycheck,anditgivesussomesenseofhowmuchvariationcanexist
within a positive expectancy framework. In this case, the account recovered to close
at $55,200, but that also might not have happened in another universe. (Note that this
is also not the lowest closing value of all accounts.) Is it possible that you can trade a
system with a positive expectancy, make no mistakes trading it, and still go bankrupt?
Absolutely.Ifso,howdowereallyevaluateourtradingperformanceandseparateskill
from luck? This is an important question to think about—though there are no certain
answers,Chapter12willoffersomeguidelinesandhelpfulmeasures.
In Table 9.1, the highest and lowest terminal values are exactly what they say: the
largest and smallest account values at the end of the 250-trade test; there will almost
certainlyhavebeensignificantlyhigherandlowervaluesatotherpointsintherun.(We
already know that one of these accounts traded down to $12,400 before recovering to
close much higher, and one of them traded up to $265,200 at one point during the test.

but this can and does happen. There are also offsetting happy surprises to the upside,

Using Different Fixed Fractions We used a 2 percent fixed fractional size as a
starting point without any real analysis or consideration; it is possible that other per-
centages could give better results. Table 9.5 shows the Monte Carlo results for several
different fixed fractional sizes, including some that are a little crazy. When we were
risking a constant $25,000 on each trade, nearly half of our accounts closed below
$25,000, the average closing value was $463,980, and some lucky trader made over
$2,000,000 at the end of the run. If we compare that to the fixed fractional 25 percent

principle of “risk more, make more” is technically true, as you can see from the mean
terminal values for the 10, 12, and 25 percent risk levels in the table, the declining me-
dians tell a different story. We cannot see it in the table, but the distribution of these
ending balances becomes unacceptable, and the payoff of our well-considered positive
expectance trading strategy starts to look more like a lottery ticket as we risk a higher
percentage of the account. Do not be misled by the sheer size of the winners, because,
as you know by now, the extremely low probabilities associated with those outcomes

servescarefulconsiderationandstudy.
THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES ON RISK
Mathematically,riskispartoftheexpectedvaluefunction,andcanbedefinedas:
Risk=Probabilityofloss×Expectedsizeofloss
Though this is a simple equation, there is a profound truth hidden here: the key to
properlyunderstandingriskisthatthemagnitudeoftheriskdependsonboththeprob-
ability and the size of the loss (see Figure 9.3). Risks that are very rare and also carry
no serious consequences are usually insignificant and can be ignored. However, make
sure the consequences are really as small as you think they are; it is easy to miscal-
culate because these events are infrequent. In addition, consequences are not always
consistent—is it possible that there is a small subset of these events that carry more
serious outcomes? Risks that are common with low consequences demand careful at-
tentionandscrutiny.Traderstendtoignoretheserisksbecausetheyareclearlydefined
andseemsmallenoughtobeinsignificant,butalargenumberofthesecaneatawayata

slippageandtransactioncosts.
High-probability, high-consequence risks are also usually easy to avoid. These are
risks that most people would characterize as stupid and inviting disaster. Most people
will look at a risk like this and simply say, “Why would you do that?” Traders usually
do not have issues with these risks because they effectively eliminate traders from the

Ingeneral,humansdonothaveagoodinternalframeworkforhandlingthecalculus
of risk and probability, especially in high-consequence, low-probability situations. The
most dangerous risks for traders lie in this quandarnt. Some people obsess over these
risks, but other times these risks are completely ignored. It is easy to mistake extreme

Uncertainty as Risk
Onecommonlyuseddefinitionofriskinmanyfieldsoffinanceisthatriskisuncertainty.
Forinstance,whendifferentassetsarebeingevaluated,thestandarddeviationsoftheir
returns are often used as a proxy measure of risk. This raises a few issues that are of-
tenignored:Firstofall,isthisright?Isuncertaintyanappropriatemeasureofrisk?This
is what is taught in business schools around the world, so it is often accepted by prac-
titioners without question. True, there are applications in other fields of finance where
uncertaintymaybeagoodmeasureofrisk.Forinstance,incorporatefinance,managers
oftenpreferaprojectthathasalower,morecertainreturntoonethathasmuchhigher
potentialpayout butwithmoreuncertainty. Certaintyofcashflowsisthegoalinsome
casesbecauseitallowsforthemostefficientallocationofresources—surprisesarenot
good.Thoughthisisappropriatefromthemanager’sperspective,itmaynotbethebest
standard to apply to trading and investment management, where strategies may some-
timesbecompletelydependentonpositivesurprisesandoutliers.
This desire for certainty finds its way into investment management when portfolio
managersusethestandarddeviationofanasset’sreturns,measuredfrompastreturns,
as a predictor of future risk. This is potentially flawed on several fronts. First, there is
noguaranteethatfuturereturnswillcarrysimilarvariationtohistoricalreturns.Infact,
itiseasytoconstructastudycomparingstandarddeviationsanddistributionsforassets
across different time windows that will reveal the folly of this assumption. It is also
entirelypossiblethatanassetmaycarryrisksthatarenotvisibleinthereturnseries.For
instance, the returns of a trader who simply writes option premiums every month are
probablyextremelyconsistent.Astrategylikethismayverywellshowmanyconsecutive
positivemonths(oryears)withlittleornovariation,butthereisnoaccountingforthe
hidden risk of an eventual catastrophic loss—execute this strategy long enough, and
there will be a day of reckoning. Other examples might be complex derivatives, such
asthosethatprecipitatedthe2007–2009financialcrisis,thathaveembeddedstructural
risks; a return series is irrelevant for such an asset, especially if the market for them
isilliquidandinactive.Quantitatively,thereisnowaytounderstandtheserisksfroma

are or how good your system is, the outcome of any one trade is more or less a coin
flip. You can be a great trader and have three or four losing trades in a row, but this
is not actually a risk. The losses on those trades are not true risk; they are the cost
of doing business. Consider the case of a retail business with asimple business model:

Execution Risk
Execution risk is a topic that covers a number of events, including some that are out
of the trader’s control. Every trader should approach the market with a precise plan
for when and where to enter and exit the market on every trade. Execution risk is the
divergencebetweenthoseintendedpointsandtheactualpricesreceived.Thoughthese

missed trades, and miscellaneous execution errors add up; collectively, these types of

mistakes can become a trading friction that will significantly erode the trader’s edge in
themarket.
Thesourcesoftheseerrorswillvaryfromtradertotraderandfrommarkettomarket
and will even be different at different points in a trader’s career. For instance, newer
traders often miss trades because they are nervous about the (false?) risk associated
with the trade. They may hesitate or they may jump the gun and execute trades when
theirmethodologydoesnotactuallycallforanentry.Sometradersrandomlyaltersizes,

Executionriskis,tosomeextent,anormalcostofdoingbusiness.Mostexecutions
that are time-sensitive will involve paying the spread on at least one, or maybe both,
sides of the trade. In liquid markets, this is a negligible expense unless your strategy
trades frequently, but for active traders, even the cost of paying a penny spread in and
out can be a significant drag on performance. It is also important to consider what liq-
uidity conditions may exist when you need to get out of a trade quickly. In some thin
markets(e.g.,illiquidfutures,currencies,orsmall-capstocks),slippageof10percentor
more is possible at times. Though this is an extreme example, remember that slippage
canbeamuchlargercostthanthenovicetraderwouldexpect.Anotherreasonthatex-

be possible to locate shares for a short sale, or other regulatory restrictions may inter-

Disaster Risk
Some disaster risks are fairly common, but some are almost impossible to plan for.
ExamplesoffairlymundanerisksarelossofpowerorInternetconnection,aharddrive
crash, or some other mechanical failure. It is important to have backup systems and
to have a plan that extends several steps further than that. But there are many more
serious risks that bear consideration. What would a natural or man-made disaster in a
major financial center do to your trading program? What if you could not access your
trading accounts for a period of days or weeks? Some of these risks are systemic risks

and then sell their inventory into the rallies. Note to regulators and exchange officials:
you want to encourage this kind of behavior. When markets are crashing, traders who
taketheriskofbuyingandpotentiallysupportingmarketsshouldberewardedforthisbe-

are an individual trader, this kind of loss could put you out of business. This is not an
isolated example; regulators and exchange officials make these random decisions sev-

In writing this chapter, my first idea was to use only trades that I had actually exe-
cuted, whether published in my Waverly Advisors market report or in my own trading
account.Intheend,pedagogicalconcernswon,andImadethedecisiontoincludesome

thanthoseIdidtrade.

B: The daily chart shows a clear, two-legged complex pullback into B, followed
by a failed attempt to resume the uptrend. Any trader contemplating buying
this market at B should have been concerned that the weekly chart was still
dramatically overextended at this point. An aggressive trader could have at-
tempted a long entry at the bottom of this complex pullback, but should have
been quick to reduce risk or exit the trade when the upswing failed a few bars
afterB.

Notethattheweeklycharthasjustnowcompletedacomplexpullbackandhas

Entry The actual entry was on the last bar of the daily chart, ideally when it broke
underthelowofthepreviousbar.Thisisacaseinwhichinformationabouttheintraday
chart can be inferred from the daily time frame. The penultimate bar on the chart was
a small buying climax on the intraday chart (not visible in this example). The reversal
the next day, our entry, reversed this buying climax and took out a number of support
levels intraday. Also, this entry follows a small two-legged complex consolidation that
would have been more clearly visible on an intraday time frame, but is also clear on
the daily chart—the small full candle two bars following C represents a failed attempt
to continue the downtrend, and the second leg of the pullback exhausts itself into that
intradaybuyingclimax.

Setup Casual inspection of a chart can sometimes give insight into the character of
a market. In this case (Figure 10.7), Amazon.com, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN) appears to be
a volatile and somewhat unpredictable stock—sharp reversals and gap openings are
the norm. You have essentially two choices trading a market like this: either use very
large stops and small position sizes or limit your involvement to the points where you

Pullback, Nested
FIGURE 10.9 ANestedPullbackinCoffeeFutures
A nested pullback is a small consolidation pattern that sets up in a drive from a
larger,possiblyhighertimeframepattern.Insomesense,itissimplyapullbackpreceded
by the typical strong setup thrust, but the difference is that bigger-picture context and
motivation are provided by the larger pattern. This particular example (Figure 10.9) is
a breakout from a multiweek range that showed no signs of failure or reversal, so the
first pause was a reasonable spot to increase long exposure. Note that there is some
overlap between these setups, and this could just as well have been categorized as the
firstpullbackfollowingabreakout.
A: Though it was not clear at the time, A marks a classic Wyckoff spring. It is not
always necessary to trade these patterns; much of the benefit comes from the

Failure Test
FIGURE 10.19 AFailureTestinAnnTaylor(NYSE:ANN)
Setup ANN had been in a multimonth uptrend, and was, in fact, a market leader for
a substantial part of the advance shown in Figure 10.19. In general, it is difficult to
find spots to short market leaders, so only the best and clearest trades are appropri-
ate. A strong sell-off going into May broke the established pattern of the trend, putting
with-trend traders on notice and giving countertrend traders warning to start watching
for potential entries. This is an important and often overlooked aspect of countertrend
trades: you must have some reason, some justification for even considering a coun-
tertrend trade, and the best justification is price action that shows a distinct change
ofcharacter.
Entry The actual entry was on the day that pressed to a new high and immediately
reversed,closingstronglylower.Thereisatrade-offbetweentradelocationandconfir-

correct, the stock should immediately melt. There should be sharp and clean

C: This downward momentum did not develop, and the trade eventually failed at
C. In this case, the preceding consolidation was small, only two or three bars.
It is a challenge to make adjustments to the trade within this time period, so
it is reasonable to expect that a trader might have booked another loss at C.
Thisisanotherreasonfordoingthesetradesonhalfrisk,relativetomostother
trade classes. In this example, a trader might have taken full losses following
two entries at both A and B. Though unusual, this does happen, so it must be
anticipatedinthetradingandriskmanagementplans.

Failure Test, Other Failures
There are a number of other possible failures for this pattern, but two deserve spe-
cial attention. It is not uncommon to see these patterns fail at or near the first target.
These targets may be touched overnight or in premarket, so it is important to have
profit-taking orders working all the time, good until canceled and outside of regular
trading hours. Sometimes other players make mistakes in those thin markets outside
regular trading hours; it is your job to be ready to take advantage of those mistakes
with well-placed profit-taking orders. One of the keys to trading these patterns well is
to be very disciplined in taking profits at this first target. It is unacceptable to have a
tradetradethroughthefirsttargetandthenturnaroundandhitthestop,andforyouto
havetakenafull-sizedlossonthetradewithnoprofitsbooked.Thisisnoteventechni-
cally a failed pattern because it did hit the first target, so follow the rules and manage
tradesappropriately.
The second failure to consider is the possibility of a failure by a large adverse gap.

In this case, after a long entry somewhere around A, the stock simply went dead
and quiet. This is not what should have happened—if there were trapped shorts ner-

aroundA.Rememberthatinanypullbacktrade,thefirst,mostconservative,targetisthe
extremeofthemovesettingupthepullback.Inthiscase,themarketwasclearlyhaving
trouble getting through this target at B. Depending on the exact entry point and stop
location, point B may have already been beyond the first profit target. If not, it would
have been prudent to reduce risk somewhere in the bars following the failure to trade
belowthepreviousswingatB.
Eventually, Coffee was able to slip below this support and appeared to be set to
trade lower. However, a sharp failure at C swept price back above support. It might
have been justifiable to hold a partial position through this large up day, especially if
partial profits had already been booked, but there is no reason to endure any more
pain following C. This small bar, consolidating at the high of the move back above
support, is a lower time frame consolidation and a strong indication that prices are
headed higher in the near term. Always respect the message of developing market
structure.

After a protracted downtrend, the USDCHF bounced and set up a potential buy
Anti. (Again, this is not a perfect example of a buy setup, as the setup leg did not dis-
play a strong change of character.) Long positions entered at A would have likely suf-
fered full losses as the market turned back down and traded through stops around B.
Further stops, located beyond the trend low, would also have been quickly hit in the
ensuingdownswing.
Though the Anti is a powerful pattern that sets up excellent trades, there are also
somedramaticfailures.Thereareevencases,notshownhere,inwhichthemarketgaps

Breakouts: First Pullback Following
Awordonterminology:stocktraderstendtousebreakoutforupsidebreakoutsthrough
resistanceandbreakdownforentriesthroughsupport;futurestradersaremorelikelyto
call both trades breakouts. Since all trade entries are more or less symmetrical, I have
optedtosimplifyandtousebreakoutforbothtrades.
Setup
A: This example was deliberately chosen because it is much less clear than a text-
book example. JPM had just come off a strong two-quarter uptrend (not visi-
bleinFigure10.40),andseemedtobesettingupforafurtheradvance.Traders
wouldhavebeenjustifiedinattemptingtobuyspringsatsupport,asinthepre-
vious example. However, there are at least two important differences between
this example and the best examples of long setups: One, successive bounces
offsupportterminateatlowerpricelevels—smallerupswingssuggestthatbuy-
ers may be losing conviction. Two, at point A price dropped cleanly below
previoussupport.
Entry
B: Again, it would have been reasonable to be looking for a long entry on a failure
testfollowingA,asthethirdbarfollowingtradedstronglybackabovesupport.
However, there was no upside momentum, and the market rolled over into a
pullback at B. Though this proved to be the ideal entry in the breakout, it was
extremelydifficulttoseethisentryatthetime;therewasatleastoneotherclear
entrylater.

C:TheentryatB,thoughobviousinretrospect,wasmuchharderinrealtime.The
entry at C in Figure 10.41, though, was a simple pullback and could have been
traded like any other pullback. There is an important lesson here: Simple tech-
nical patterns become more powerful when they are put in context of bigger-
picturemarketstructure.Inthiscase,thefailureofthepotentialupsideconsol-
idationthroughadownsidebreakoutcouldbeexpectedtoleadtoseveraltrend
legs down. Taking bearish pullbacks in those conditions would have been an
excellenttrade.
D: This is probably the ideal exit for a trader looking to take one clean swing out
of the market. A failure test at lows, on the third attempt to make new lows,
tilted the probabilities slightly against the bears. In this case, the stock traded
lower,butaftermorethanamonthofsloppyconsolidation.Findthebesttrades,
thecleanesttrades,forthatiswhereyourmentalandfinancialcapitalcanbest

Conclusions Another lesson here is that there is nothing magical about the break-
out level. The pullback following breakouts can violate the pullback level (as B did
in this example), can stop at the level, or can hold well clear of the level. In each
case, price action is far more informative than the market’s relation to a specific
pricelevel.

Onepointtoconsideristhattheseinitialpostbreakoutpullbacksarerarelycomplex
pullbacks. In general, simple pullbacks are a sign of some urgency in the trend, while
complexpullbacksareneededtoworkoffpossibleoverextensionsinfurthertrendlegs.
In the best breakout examples, a strong trend will quickly follow and this strong trend
will not generate complex pullbacks early on. Traders can trade these postbreakout
pullbacks with fairly tight stops (not referring to the breakout level, but to the geom-
etry of the actual pullback pattern) and usually need not consider the possibility of a
complexpullback.
Failure in Base Last, though entering in the base preceding a breakout has many
advantages, there is one important problem—the breakout may never happen. For in-
stance, buying in anticipation of an upside breakout in Figure 10.40 would have been
a perfectly reasonable trade, but it would have been a losing trade. There is an eternal
trade-offbetweenconfirmationandtradelocation.Atraderpositioningearlyhasexcel-
lent trade location, but perhaps with a lower probability of the trade actually working.
Traderswaitingfortheactualbreakoutoftenfindthemselvesinapositionofweakness

Perceiving Patterns in Randomness
Have you ever seen faces in clouds, or shapes in the wood grain of finished furniture?
Ever heard voices murmuring, just out of the range of perception, when you hold a
seashell up to your ear? These are universal experiences, and they most likely come
from a slight misfiring of some powerful cognitive machinery. For instance, processing
andrecognizingfacesisactuallyanextremelycomplextask,butnearlyallhumanscan
do this naturally and instantaneously. There are specific areas of the brain that have
evolved to deal with this complex task, but the same areas of the brain will also take
random patterns in clouds and force them into the structure of human faces. From an
evolutionaryperspective,therewasnopayoffforbeingabletoproperlyprocessrandom
data, no reason that natural selection would have preserved this skill. Instead, humans
who could quickly process faces and manage social interactions with their peers were
probably far more likely to survive in prehistory than were early humans who did not
excelattheseskills.

are some problems that can be solved in seconds or minutes heuristically that would
require hours or days of rational analysis. The root of heuristic thinking is the ability
to relate new experiences to old, already processed information—“Oh, this looks like

COGNITIVE BIASES
Thischapteropenedwiththequestion“Whyistradingsohard?”Itseemsthatitshould
be easier than it actually is: we acknowledge that markets are extremely random and
that there is a very small component of actionable trading signals in market data, but
it is there. Why is it not possible to devise simple ways to capture this edge and watch
profits accumulate in the trading account? This actually does describe the best high-
leveltrading,butfewindividualtradersevergettothatstage.Oneofthereasonsisthat
theevolutionaryadaptationsandheuristicswejustdiscussedresultinsomeconsistent
cognitive biases. We are practically designed to make trading mistakes. Though these
skills do serve useful purposes, unchecked they work just as effectively to ensure our
failureastraders.Mosttradersenterthemarketplacewithnoawarenessofthehandicaps
and weaknesses they bring into the arena, and they are doomed to failure before they
evenbegin.Thefirststepincombatingthesebiasesisknowingthattheyexistandthat
they will unavoidably color every interaction with the market. A partial list of some of
themorecommoncognitivebiasesfollows.
Gambler’s Fallacy
Thegambler’sfallacystemsfromfaultyintuitionaboutrandomprocesses.Afterobserv-
ing deviations in a random process, most people will be inclined to think that future

Biases Concerning Losses
Consider the following two scenarios. In each, you have a choice between taking the
certainpayoutorlossandplayingthegameofchance:
1. You are given the choice between a certain $100 win and a 20 percent chance of
making$1,000withan80percentchanceofwinningnothing.
2. You are given the choice between a certain $100 loss and a 20 percent chance of
losing(havingtopay)$1,000withan80percentchanceoflosingnothing.

Logically,thecorrectcourseofactionisclear:playthegameofchanceinthewin-

scenario. Most people, and even most traders, are inclined to do exactly the opposite
in both cases. They will want to lock in the certain gain and will prefer to take their
chancesonthelossbecausethereissomechancethattheycanavoidthelossaltogether.
This results in suboptimal decisions with respect to position management and exiting
bothwinnersandlosers.Manytraderswilltakesmallwinsandwillholdontoalossin

justification for the old adage to “cut your losers and let your winners run,” but many

There are traders whose hubris extends to every aspect of trading, but the market
usually eliminates those traders quickly and efficiently. It is far more common to find
traders who believe they have a special skill or affinity for an asset class. Do you just
know what a certain set of stocks is going to do? Do you have a special sense for the
relationship between a currency and a commodity? Do you have a touch for a certain

andtoignoreordownplayinformationthatcontradicts.Thisbiasisakeypartofkeeping
manyotherbiasesalive.Forinstance,traderscouldnotbeoverconfidentintheirability
with a certain trade setup if they were truly, objectively evaluating their results. How-
ever, when they remember two winners and forget about five losers, or come up with
reasons why the five losers shouldn’t matter, they are engaging in confirmation bias.
Recordkeeping,bothoftraderesultsandofresearch,iscritical,becausethisbiasoften
distortsmemory—yousimplywillnotremembercontradictoryinformation,oritwillbe
somehow fuzzy and obscured. In most cases, the confirmation bias is not a deliberate
attempt to deceive or to manipulate data, but it occurs as a result of the fundamental
waysinwhichweprocessinformation.
Anchoring Bias
Anchoring bias is the tendency to place undue weight on one particular piece of infor-
mationandtoignoreeverythingelse.Inthecaseoftheoverconfidenttrader,maybeshe
hasmadeatrade20timeswith18losers,butoneofthewinnerswasdramatic.Itiseasy
to find your entire perspective colored by a large outlier event, whether it was good or

this bias. Paradoxically, though it is important for traders to spend time studying the
marketanditspatterns,studyingcarefullychosentradeexamplescanactuallybecoun-
terproductive; too many traders waste time trying to figure out how to reproduce the

Emotions can cause us to overweight and underweight certain factors, and sometimes
tomakedecisionswithoutanyreasoningatall.Successfultradershavemanystrategies
for dealing with their emotions, but that is the common thread—they have all found a
waytointegratetheiremotionsintotheirtradingprocess.Somedenyandcontrolthem
with iron discipline and try to become logical machines, some seek modes of trading
that remove emotion from the decision process, and some embrace their emotionality
andactuallybuildtheirtradingprocessaroundit;butinallcases,theyunderstandtheir

Ego
We all have egos. (I am using the term ego here in the colloquial sense to mean self-
image rather than in any formal, psychoanalytical context.) Everyone likes to be right,
likestobeseenasintelligent,andlikestobeawinner.Weallhatetolose,andwehate
to be wrong; traders, as a group, tend to be more competitive than the average per-
son. These personality traits are part of what allows a trader to face the market every
day—a person without exceptional self-confidence would not be able to operate in the
market environment. Like so many things, ego is both a strength and a weakness for
traders. When it goes awry, things go badly wrong. Excessive ego can lead traders to
the point where they are fighting the market, or where they hold a position at a signif-
icant loss because they are convinced the market is wrong. It is not possible to make
consistent money fighting the market, so ego must be subjugated to the realities of the
marketplace.
One of the big problems is that, for most traders, the need to be right is at least as
strong as the drive to make money—many traders find that the pain of being wrong is
greaterthanthepainoflosingmoney.Youoftenhaveminutesorsecondstoevaluatea

the normal losses that accrue as part of the trading process, but there is certainly the
danger of the unexpected and uncontrollable loss from an outlier event. Recent flash
crashes have shown that stable markets can have unprecedented sell-offs; who would
have thought that a big blue-chip stock could drop 80 percent in a few minutes? Many

Many developing traders overestimate the importance of intuition, believing that it
will cure all of their trading ills. They may think that great traders have a sixth sense
that other people do not, that they just trade based on this gut feeling. Some people
believe that great traders are born with market sense—either you have it or you don’t.

Developing Intuition
There is no magic in intuition. Rather, it is a normal problem solving skill that func-
tions on a level outside of consciousness. As such, it cannot be forced, but it can be
cultivated—there are things you can do to foster the growth and development of intu-
ition. Everyone has had the experience of working very hard on a problem and being
unable to solve it during the work session, and then the answer coming spontaneously

WhereDoesIntuitionComeFrom?
There have been many studies in the social sciences and in psychology that have estab-
lishedtherealityofhumanintuition.Focusingspecificallyontradingandmarket-related
intuition,Bruguier,Quartz,andBossaerts(2010)structuredasetofexperimentsdesigned
to“betterdefinewhatismeantby‘traderintuition,’andtounderstandwhysometraders
arebetterthanothers.”Theydidthisbycreatinganumberofscenariosrepresentingmar-
ketsthatbothhadanddidnothavetradingbyinformedinsiders,withthegoalofseeingif
novicetraderscouldintuittheintentionsoftheseinformedinsidersthroughpricemove-
ments. Perhaps surprisingly, they found that uninformed traders with no experience in
financialmarketswerequicklyabletodiscerntheintentionsoftheseinformedinsiders,
basedonnothingmorethaninformationcontainedinpricechangesthemselves.
The logical question, of course, is how did they do that? Bruguier et al. postulated
aconnectionbetweentraders’intuitioninmarketsituationsandaspecificabilityknown
in the literature as theory of mind (ToM). ToM is the human ability (perhaps shared by
someotherprimates)toreadbenevolenceormalevolencethroughthepatternsinone’s
surroundings—for instance, the ability to read another person’s intentions through eye
expressionorthroughmovesinastrategicgame.Sincemarketswithinsidersrepresent
anenvironmentthatmaybedeliberatelymanipulatedagainsttheuninformedtrader,ToM
becomesapotentiallyrelevantskill.NotonlydidBruguieretal.findthattraderintuition
intheirmarketsimulationswasstronglycorrelatedwithtestsforbroaderToM-basedabil-
ities, but it was specifically uncorrelated with ability on mathematical or logical tests.
Last, they confirmed in brain scans that subjects were activating areas of the brain that
have been associated with ToM in previous tests and experiments. It appears that sub-
jectswereusinghighlyevolvedportionsoftheirbrainsinnewcontextsandapplications
todrivemarketintuition.

how the market really works and forwhat drives unfolding pricemovements, and they
arealsowillingtoletgoofpreconceptionsandtheoriesimmediatelyiftheyaredisproven
by the market. All good discretionary traders are statistics junkies, whether they know
it or not. Some are attracted to hard-core statistical methods, but many others spend
hours studying charts and keeping records and journals of market behavior. What are
they doing if not internalizing the patterns of the market? I would suggest that a rigid
analyticalframeworkhastheadvantageofobjectivityandscope,butdedicatedtraders
can accomplish many of the same goals with charts, records of their own trades, and

Eventhoughmuchcanbequantified,mosttraderswillexperienceperiodsofknow-

reaction associated with a pattern; maybe, for instance, you are considering a trade in

FLOW
Have you ever been so completely engrossed in an activity that you become lost in it?
Maybe you had no sense of time and hours seemed like minutes—you forgot what you
were doing, and even the normal, scattered wandering of your mind stopped and you
were completely focused on the task at hand. Chances are, whatever you were doing,

How to Get There
In the flow state, we are supremely competent. Someone observing our performance
would remark that we make a complex task appear effortless and easy; this, in fact, is
oneoftheattributesoftruemasteryinmanydisciplines.Eliteperformersdotheirbest
work in the flow state, so it is worth our time to consider the nature of this state, how
togetthere,andhowtoguardagainsteventsthatcouldjeopardizetheflowexperience.
To this end, Cs´ıkszentmiha´lyi, Abuhamdeh, and Nakamura (2005) identified three key
conditionsthatmustexistbeforeflowispossible.(Ihaveaddedafourthconditionbased
onmyownexperience.)Thepresenceoftheseconditionsdoesnotguaranteethatflow
willbeachieved,but,withoutthem,itisnotpossible.
1. Theactivitymusthaveclearlydefinedobjectivesandgoals.
2. Thetaskmustofferclearandimmediatefeedback.
3. Theperformermusthaveconfidencethathisorherskillsarematchedtothetask.
4. The experience rests on a set of foundational skills that are assimilated below the
levelofconsciousthought.
Performanceinanycomplextaskcontainsagreatdegreeofvariation,eventhough
this may not be apparent to an outside observer. For the athlete, changing humidity,
lighting,orotherenvironmentalconditionswillplayapartinperformance.Anartistmay
encounter materials that have slightly different properties due to temperature or com-
position. Peak performance does not proceed in an unerringly straight line; there is no
perfection, even though it may appear so to the outside observer. Constant and subtle
adjustmentshavetobemade.Goodperformersintheflowstatemaketheseadjustments
easily and naturally—this is possible only because the task offers a constant stream
offeedback.
Outsidestresscanjeopardizetheflowexperience.Performersintheflowstatemust
be confident that they can handle whatever challenges the experience will throw their
way. Figure 11.1 shows a chart adapted from Cs´ıkszentmiha´lyi’s Finding Flow (1997)
that considers performers’ state of mind at the intersection of their skills and the chal-
lenges of the task. In the lower left quadrant, skills and demands are low, and the per-
former simply does not care about the task. This is the plight of an office worker who
mightdescribethejobastrivialandmeaningless.Ifchallengesincreasewithoutacom-
mensurateincreaseinskillsandabilities(movingalongtheverticalaxisofthechart),the
performers’stressincreasesastheyrealizethattheyarefacingataskforwhichtheyare

far beyond the challenges present, results may suffer as the performer could actually
betoorelaxedandcomfortable.Interestingthingsstarttohappenwhenextremelyhigh
challenges are met with correspondingly high skills; it is here that the performer starts

368 THEINDIVIDUAL,SELF-DIRECTEDTRADER
Manynewtradersaretradingmethodsandideasinthemarketthatdonothaveanedge
and, rather than rectifying the real problem, they focus on the performance insights of
tradingpsychology.Muchofthetimenewtradersspendonpsychologywouldbebetter
spentunderstandingthetruenatureofthemarket’smovements.
For developing traders though, the situation is different. Once you have a method
that has an edge in the market, it is impossible to apply that edge without having the
proper mind-set and attitude. Traders find themselves making many strange mistakes
thatcompromise theirresults, and these areoften due topsychological issues. Dealing
withthe psychological stresses of trading is one of the core skills of competent discre-
tionarytrading,anditissomethingthatrequiresongoingmaintenancethroughoutaca-
reer.Nooneiseverimmunetopsychologicallydrivenerrors.Formoreexperiencedand
developing traders, it does make sense to focus on this area, perhaps even seeking the
helpofaqualifiedprofessionalinthefield.
Mostofthesuggestionsthatfollowarefortheself-directedtraderworkingaloneor

quantitativesystemdesigners,yoursituationmaybedifferent.Youwillstillbeinclined
tomakethesesameerrors,buttheconstraintsofyourjobortheinstitutionalframework
may define your role well enough that your behavior is restricted. You may still find
insight in understanding the issues self-directed traders face, because these reflect the
psychologyofthemarketandpricemovementsatimportantinflectionpoints.
Develop an Approach That Fits Your Personality
Who are you? It has been said that if you don’t know the answer to this question, the
markets are an expensive place to find out. This is true, and many millions of dollars
andyearsofpeople’sliveshavebeenwastedbecausetheyweretryingtotrademethods
or markets that were a poor fit for their psychological makeup. One of the secrets to
managingyourselfpsychologicallyistopickatradingstylethatplaystoyourstrengths.
So,onceagain,whoareyou?Somepeoplemakedecisionsintuitivelyandquickly,while
others tend to prefer long debate and a careful weighing of all relevant factors. Some
traders are naturally inclined to be more aggressive and active, while others prefer a
more sedate pace. Some developing traders have serious constraints on their time and
are not able to monitor markets intraday, whereas others can sit at the screen every
minute the market is open. Some traders may have backgrounds and experiences that
makecertainmarketsmoreinterestingorattractivetothem.Forinstance,atraderwho
grew up on a farm will probably have natural inclinations toward agricultural markets
that might be alien to a trader with a strong background in accounting and corporate
finance. Every piece of their trading methodology and trading plan must be shaped by
whothetraderis.
Choose a Market The choice of which markets to study and trade is an important
one. Many retail traders are drawn to foreign exchange, but this is probably because
of the extremely low account balances required to open a forex account. This is also

However, the costs and challenges of day trading are severe; the impact of trans-
action costs alone presents an insurmountable barrier for many traders. For instance,
imagine a trader with a $250,000 account who does 10 trades a day and who likes to
trade stocks in the $150 to $200 range that might have, on average, $0.05 spreads. Fur-

advantagestoworkinginthesameoffice.Ifyoudecidetopursuethisrelationship,spend
alotoftimeconsideringhowyouwillworkwithyourteammate.Expectationsmustbe
clearly defined. Have a clear plan for how work will be divided; it makes sense to do
some of the work together, but most teams find it useful to have done a good deal of
individualworkbeforebringingideastotheteam.Expectthatyoubothwillmakeerrors,
and expect to be called out on them. One of the reasons you are working with another
person is to have the benefit of someone looking over your shoulder and monitoring
your emotional state, but the first time you are on tilt and someone taps you on the
shoulder to suggest that you need to step back is always a difficult moment in the life
ofatrader.Itrequiresexceptionalmaturityandself-awarenesstosuccessfullymanagea

Working with a Mentor Most traders who achieve some degree of success owe
muchofthatsuccesstotheguidanceofamentor.(Personally,Icanthinkofthreepeople

Second, the question of fit is very important, both in style and personality. A men-
tor with a hard-core, drill-sergeant style approach will be completely ineffective with a
student seeking a supportive, nurturing approach. A mentor who focuses on intraday

Last,theissueofcompensationshouldbeunderstoodclearlybybothparties.Men-

Commit to the Process
In many ways, the intellectual problems of trading are trivial. This may seem to be an
ironic statement, given that it appears in a large book about trading, but the essential
elements of market structure and trade management could fit on a single piece of pa-
per. The elaborations, variations, and applications are much more extensive and will
reward long study, but the core knowledge of trading is not complicated. Most traders

withtheconsequences.Onlybylivingthroughthatlooprepeatedlycanthetradermake
progress;regular,repeatedexposureisthekey.
Stay Small Again, while you are going through this learning curve, expect to lose
money. This is what new and developing traders do—they lose money while they are
learning. Therefore, it makes sense to keep your risk as small as possible on each
tradeuntilyouhaveachievedconsistency.Thegainorlossonanyindividualtradeshould

do not expect that your learning curve will be described by a straight, upward-sloping
line.Itisfarmorecommonforstudentsofanyhigh-levelskilltofindthattheirprogress

You will hear various stats suggesting that somewhere around 95 percent of self-

Journal
A good journal is one of the trader’s most important tools. For the developing self-
directed trader, it is a concrete record of successes and failures; careful reflection on
and analysis of this record can point out weaknesses and growing edges that can have
an immediate impact on the bottom line. Having a good written record is essential, be-
cause memory is somewhat mutable after the fact. Highly emotional events, gains and

Though many brokers produce records that are adequate for most accounting and

recordkeepingiscategorizingalltradesandexecutionsaccordingtothesetuporpattern

breakeven trades to consider. Standard deviation is calculated as an intermediate step

First, consider the bottom line of the table, which gives summary statistics for all
tradescombined.Overthisperiod,thistradermade$3,158onstartingcapitalof$100,000.
The first question to ask is: Is this good performance? Even a simple question like
thismaynothaveasimpleanswer.Ononehand,$3,158isnotalotofmoney,butifthis
is performance over one quarter, a 3.16 percent gain is perhaps not bad. Assuming this
tradercanrepeatthisperformanceregularly,3.16percentquarterlycompoundstoare-
spectable13.2percentannually:(1+0.0316)4 −1.
However, it is not so simple: The standard deviation of the trades is a staggering
$600 compared to a mean trade of $46. This is not good, and suggests that the positive
performance could have been nothing more than luck. The p value of 0.263 basically
says that, given this set of trades, there is a 26.3 percent chance of seeing results at
least this extreme due to random chance even if the trader did not actually have an
edge. Figure 12.1, a running total of the individual trades, provides another check on

as two large losses, followed by two small wins, lead to eight losing trades in a row.
However, this period is followed by a nearly unbroken series of wins on the last third
of the graph. There are questions that must be asked here that cannot be answered by
this simple analysis: Why did this happen? Does the trader’s style favor certain market
environments over others, or is there an element of performance psychology here? Is
thetraderhimselfresponsibleforthesestreaksoflossesorwins?Essentiallyallofthe
positive P&L comes from the long run of wins at the end, so is there some repeatable

This trader should possibly consider these trades further, and ask if some of the other

Thisisalsoavividillustrationofthefactthatneitherreward/riskrationorwinning

Standardizing for Risk
Onecomplicatingfactoristhatthistraderwasnotconsistentinhisrisk.Thoughnotvis-
ible in Table 12.1, risk per trade on the $100,000 account ranged from a low of $199 to
a high of $1,790. The nominal trade risk will vary under a fixed percentage plan (see
Chapter 9), but this trader was not executing a fixed percentage plan as trade risks
rangedfrom0.2percentto1.8percentofequityatthetimeofentry.Standardizingeach
trade’s P&L as a percentage of the amount risked can provide deeper insight into the
trader’sperformance:
%R=ActualdollarP&L÷Initialrisk
Table12.2showstheresultofthisanalysis.
This time, the results paint a very different picture. On average, the trader made
0.3 times the initial risk on every trade, with a standard deviation of 0.8; this is a much
better ratio of return to standard deviation than in the first table. The t-test shows that
this P&L is statistically significant at the 0.001 level, as there would be less than a 0.1
percent chance of seeing a result this extreme due to random chance. There is a very

Atfirstglancetheyappeartobesimilar,showingthesamerunsofwinsandlosses,but
look again. Notice especially that the two large losses that stood out in the middle of
Figure 12.2 are normal, insignificant losses when expressed as %R. Is it possible that
the trader increased risk on those two trades, taking outsized risks and losses? If so,
could those losses have unbalanced him psychologically and led to the series of losing
trades? This cannot be answered from a numerical analysis, but these are the kinds
of questions that must be asked. Note that, in general, Figure 12.3 is much more

Control Charts
Control charts are tools used in manufacturing to monitor physical processes for early
signsofdegradationorfailure,andareanimportantqualitycontroltoolindiversefields
such as metalworking, electronics, and pharmaceutical manufacturing, among others.
They are especially powerful in physical processes that can be tightly controlled, espe-
ciallywithlargesamplesizes.Forinstance,anautomobilepartproducedonanassembly

do not hold in trading situations. For instance, one commonly used chart in manufac-

wander more or less freelyabove and below that average. The quality control manager

In the hypothetical case of XYZ that just traded at $50, we might find that the best
available bid is $49.95 and the lowest offered price is $50.05. A trader would verbalize
this situation as “49.95 bid, offered at 50.05,” which is usually shortened in practice to
“49.95at50.05.”Ifthetraderisreasonablysurethepersonheisspeakingtoknowsthe
approximate price, he may drop the handle (the whole number) part of the price and
just give the decimal pricing. As prices change rapidly, this can lead to a dialogue like
“95at05[meaning.95and.05],at7,at9,98bid,nowat06.”Thoughthelasttrademay

Some traders glean a lot of information from the spread. For instance, the size of
thespreadisoftenameasureoftheuncertaintyinthemarket;whenpricesarechanging
rapidly, market participants often react bywidening thespread. Buyers arenot aggres-

TWO TYPES OF ORDERS
Traderswishingtobuythismarkethave,broadlyspeaking,twooptions.Abuyerwhois
not really in any hurry might focus on getting the best (lowest) price he can get, so he
canbidforthestock.(Inthiscase,bidisusedasaverbmeaning“toplaceanorderlower
thancurrentprices.”)ConsiderthecaseofXYZwiththemarketbidat49.95andoffered
at50.05;abuyercouldjoin the bidandputhisorderat49.95.Ofcourse,thebuyercan
alsoplaceorderslower,buttheywillbefilledonlyifthemarketmovesdowntothelevel
where he is bidding. If the buyer is feeling a little more urgency, he can step in front
of the bid and put his order at 49.96 or 49.97. Note that in this case, the inside market
wouldnowbe49.97(stillofferedat50.05).Thisisanaturalforcethattendstocompress
spreadsasbuyersbidslightlyhigherandsellersofferlowerincompetitionforfills,andis
oneofthemainreasonswhyactive,liquidmarketstendtohavetightspreads.However,
ifthebuyerisreallymotivatedandmusthavestockXYZnow,hemaychoosetopaythe
offer(othercommonlanguageistaketheoffer,andthereverseistohitthebid).Though
much simplified, these are the two options available to traders and they correspond to
thetwomostcommonlyusedordertypes.
Limit orders are orders where buyers try to buy at a cheaper price than the offer
andsellersoffertosellatpricesabovethebid.AtraderwantingtobuyXYZwithalimit
ordermightsay,“Bidforit”or“Jointhebid,”asin“We’reinnohurryhere—justbidfor
it.”Asellermightsay,“Okay,fine,offeritout.Putitupontheoffer.”Market ordersare
orders that will execute immediately. Buyers will pay the offer and sellers will end up
hittingthebid.Theseordersusuallyreflectsomedegreeofurgency—theordermustbe
doneimmediatelyandabetterprice(tradelocation)issacrificedforspeedofexecution.
Thoughthebuyerbiddingwithalimitorderwillgetabetterpriceiffilled,thetrade-off
isthattheordermayneverbefilledifthemarketmoveshigher.
Nowwehavearrivedatsomethingsubtleandveryimportant.ImagineXYZisagain
49.95 at 50.05, and then it trades at 50.05. What just happened? A buyer wanted to buy
the stock so much that he was willing to pay the spread or take the offer; we can say
that this is a buyer-motivated trade. By analyzing the number of orders that hit the
bid (seller-motivated trades) compared to those that take the offer (buyer-motivated
trades),whetherthroughcomputer-aidedanalysisorcarefulobservation,traderscanget
adeepersenseoftheconvictionlevelsandurgencybehindpricemoves.Forinstance,a
stockmaymovefrom50to51inaseriesofback-and-forthmotionswithordersprinting
on both the bid and the offer. At another time, the same price change could occur in a
straightlineasbuyerskeeppayingtheofferandkeepthatbuyingpressureontheoffer
for the entire move. Simple observation would note that both moves began at 50 and
endedat51,andperhapsevenoccurredinthesameamountoftimeandwiththesame

The EMA is a considerably more complex animal. Recent data are weighted more
heavily in an EMA, and, technically, no data points are ever dropped from the average.
Rather than being dropped, past data is rolled off with an exponential decay. In actual

THE MACD
Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) was one of the early technical tools
developed by Gerald Appel in the mid-1970s. As an interesting aside, this is one of the
fewcommonlyusedindicatorswhosenameactuallysayssomethingaccurateaboutthe
tool.Considersomeotherindicators:stochasticshavenothingatalltodowithstochas-
tic processes; the Relative Strength Index (RSI) neither measures relative strength nor
isitanindex;theCommodityChannelIndex(CCI)isnotcommodity-specific,nordoes
it deal with channels, nor is it an index. This is not an exhaustive list, but you get the
idea. The standard MACD consists of four elements: a fast line (the MACD proper), a
slow line (the signal line), a zero line for reference, and a histogram (bar chart) that
shows the difference between the slow and fast lines. The standard MACD is con-
structedfromexponentialmovingaverages,butthismodifiedversionusessimplemov-
ing averages and dispenses with the MACD histogram altogether, resulting in a cleaner
indicator.
Basic Construction of the MACD
The fast line of the MACD measures the distance between a shorter-term and a longer-
termmovingaverage.Tounderstandexactlywhatthismeasuresaysaboutpriceaction,
thinkabouthowdifferentperiodsofmovingaverageswillrespondtopricemovement.
A moving average with a short look-back window (period) will track price movements
more closely than an average with a longer period. Figure B.8 shows 3-period and 10-
periodsimplemovingaveragesappliedtoadailychartoftwo-yearTreasurynotes.The

If you are looking at Figure B.12 and thinking that this could never be relevant in
actualtrading,considerthedailychartofAppleInc.inFigureB.13.Afteradowntrend,
the market transitioned to an uptrend at the point marked A, and the MACD fast line
immediately responded by hooking upward, just as in the inflection marked A in the
previous chart. Real market action, of course, contains much more noise and variation
than our simplified example, but much of the downturn in the line at point B in Figure
B.13 is due to this 10-bar artifact. A trader paying too much attention to the indicator’s
line at this point might surmise that momentum had turned downward. Prices did take
a small pause at this point, but the indicator’s reaction was out of proportion to that
change. Point C is also interesting; a large move up is required to hook the fast line
up after an extended trend. Half of the battle with using indicators is knowing when
to use them and when to ignore them. If you are reacting to every jot of the indicator,
you are missing the point. It is much better to use the tool only at potential inflections
to add another layer of confidence to analysis that focuses primarily on the price bars
themselves.

always irrelevant after a large price shock, and attention should be focused on other

So far, these theoretical data sets have been so clean that it may be difficult to re-
late them to situations that are likely to occur in actual trading. Consider next what
happens when the MACD is applied to a data set that begins to more closely approxi-
mate real market conditions, as in Figure B.15. This data set alternates uptrending and

risk-free rate In finance, the rate an investor could have realized in a theoretically
risk-free investment. In practice, a U.S. Treasury bond, bill, or note with a maturity ap-

a proxy for the risk-free rate. An investor must achieve higher returns than what she
could have attained in a risk-free investment, so this is used as a hurdle rate in many
applications.
