Preface
Y
ou can ’t afford to ignore forex anymore.
T his is an urgent message I carry everywhere I go. It really
doesn’ t matter who we are or what stage in life we’ re at. You could
be in school and you can’ t seem to fi gure out the rules of global fi nance.
You could be holding down a job but you desire to make a decent second
income in your spare time.
Y ou could already be involved in the fi nancial markets as a retail trader
or investor, but with low yields and depressed growth all around the world,
you are searching for an asset class that offers unparalleled returns. You
might even be a fund manager who holds an international portfolio in dif-
ferent asset classes, such as equities, bonds, and commodities.
However, with central banks lowering rates and injecting record
amounts of liquidity into the fi nancial system, you realize the importance
of protecting your entire portfolio against currency risks.
Finally, you might be someone running a multinational company. You
could be based in one country, but your offi ces span across many countries
all around the world. Expenses for salaries, infrastructure, machinery, and
supplies are paid out in different currencies every single month. As the
business gets larger, you can’ t turn a blind eye to the currency fl uctuations,
which have a signifi cant impact to the company ’s bottom line every month.
I f you fi nd yourself in any one of these categories, this book is for you.
The sooner we all understand the forex “game,” the better it is going to
be for us. Forex is a game for three reasons. First, playing it must be fun.
Second, we play it with an intention to win. Finally, it has rules. If you break
the rules, the rules will break you.
HOW IT ALL BEGAN
I had a painful start to forex trading because I broke a cardinal rule. Allow
me to share my story with you. I’ ll be the fi rst to admit that I ’m not a smart
guy. I don ’t have a fi nance degree or an economics degree.

xii PREFACE
I studied chemical engineering in school but graduated with third-class
honors, dashing my mother’ s hopes of my becoming a top chief executive
for a Fortune 500 company. After graduation, I proceeded to apply for a job
at petroleum giant Shell, but I haven ’t heard from them yet.
Sometimes I console myself by thinking that my resume lost its way in
the mail. I didn’ t have much materially then, but what I had was the burning
desire to achieve success in life. It was this desire to succeed that led me to
my fi rst experience with forex trading.
Six years ago, I was with a friend in a local coffee shop when he sud-
denly fl ipped open his laptop to reveal a screen full of charts. Through the
charts and jumping numbers on the screen, I asked him, “What ’s this?”
He coolly replied, “Forex trading.”
Thinking it was some hobby he recently picked up, I asked again, “Real
cash?”
“Yes.” He nodded smugly. “Real cash.”
T hat began to draw me in, slowly but surely. Looking back, it wasn’ t the
fact that forex was the biggest fi nancial market in the world that drew me in.
What drew me in was the fact that all you needed was an Internet connection
and a laptop to make money from this market anywhere in the world.
F ascinated, I started to ask my trader friend some questions. When he
shared with me the story of how George Soros broke the Bank of England
on September 16, 1992, and made $1 billion in a day, I was hooked.
I ’ m the kind of guy who only needs one live example of someone who
has done something to convince me that I can do it too. Excited about this
new discovery called forex trading, I went off and started to do my own
reading on free websites.
Soon I started my fi rst account with USD3,000.
MY FIRST TRADE
My fi rst trade was on the GBP/USD. It was on an uptrend, and the price had
reached a new high. This is it, I thought, rubbing my hands gleefully. I ’m
going to be a millionaire by next Friday. Seeing that the price had reached a
new high, I was convinced that gravity would pull it right down.
I clicked “sell.” That poignant moment was the start of my painful les-
son. After I clicked “sell,” the price continued to creep up. That’ s not sup-
posed to happen, I thought.
As prices continued climbing, I decided to hit the sell button again,
only this time with double the lot size (and double the intensity) as my fi rst
trade. I reasoned that if I clicked twice the number of lots, all that needed
to happen was for prices to fall a little before I could see some nice profi ts.
ffpprreeff..iinndddd xxiiii 0033//1122//1122 44::3333 PPMM

Preface xiii
After the second “sell” click, I couldn ’t believe my eyes. The price
went up further. My hands started to get sweaty. My head started to shine
from the beads of sweat that started to trickle down from my bald head.
Murphy’ s Law was in full motion. In desperation, I actually grabbed the
laptop and turned it upside down to paint me a picture of falling prices.
My ego was badly hurt.
“It ’s got to come down,” I muttered to myself. At that point, I clicked
“sell” for a third time, with double the lot size of the second trade.
T he numbers on my laptop screen at the time weren’ t very far from the
numbers my friend had shown me. The only difference was that mine had a
stubborn negative sign preceding them that just wouldn ’t go away. A couple
of days after my third dreaded click, the broker closed off all my positions.
I was hit with the dreaded margin call.
In a grand total of just six days, I had lost my entire account.
Whenever I share my story in my forex seminars, I replicate the sce-
nario and draw an uptrend on the whiteboard.
“ Would you click ‘buy’ or ‘ sell’ over here?” I always ask, as I circle the
highest point reached by the price. At every single seminar, most people
choose to sell, confi dent that high prices will fall.
I t’ s almost a consolation to know that we human beings are wired in
much the same way. Needless to say, after I blew up my account, I was
devastated.
THERE ARE NO SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSES
Losing USD3,000 of my hard-earned money in a week was heart-wrenching.
Self-defeating thoughts appeared in my mind incessantly.
“Forex is risky.”
“Forex is gambling.”
“Forex is not for me.”
I was tempted to wash my hands from the forex market and walk away.
H owever, it was at this low point of my life that the words of a rich and
successful Chinese businessman who was my mentor came to mind.
(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:1002)(cid:11040)(cid:990)(cid:8821)(cid:7389)(cid:6116)(cid:2163)(cid:11352)(cid:1119)(cid:1006)(cid:712)(cid:2494)(cid:7389)(cid:6116)(cid:2163)(cid:11352)(cid:1166)(cid:452)(cid:3)
“There are no successful businesses in this world, only successful
people.”
A t this point, I stopped the pity party and asked myself two questions:
Do I know people who are making money in the forex market? And: Do I
want to be in that group?
ffpprreeff..iinndddd xxiiiiii 0033//1122//1122 44::3333 PPMM

xiv PREFACE
I picked myself up again after I answered yes to both questions. I
started to work on myself. You see, it’ s very easy for you and me to get
sucked into recognizing that 80% of people lose money in the forex market.
However, why can ’t we decide to be in the group that makes money?
Isn ’t it just a simple switch in our thinking? If 20% of the people are making
money, let’ s decide fi rst to have our names in that special group. That self-
talk was the turning point in my forex trading journey. I made up my mind
to master forex trading.
P icking myself up from the setback, I began to equip myself with
the right trading skills. I started devouring books by successful traders.
Emulating their beliefs, knowledge, and habits, I worked hard on honing
my trading skills every single day. My quest for mastery also led me to seek
out two of the biggest names in the forex industry as my mentors: Kathy
Lien and Ed Ponsi.
I reasoned that a mentor could help me to drastically cut short my
learning curve. And cut short my learning curve they did.
Knowing what I know now, I recognize that the cardinal rule that I
broke in my fi rst live trading experience was to trade against the trend.
W ithin three years and several buckets of blood, sweat and tears later,
I became an expert in trading the forex market. Less than a year later, I was
invited to appear on CNBC to give my opinions on global fi nance.
WISH THAT YOU WERE BETTER
G iven my bubbly character, many people think that it’ s easy being on cam-
era, speaking live to a camera that holds the attention of over 300 million
viewers. The truth for me is that it ’s not.
“Mario, what do you think the CPI is going to be for Singapore?”
“Mario, what ’s your view on the U.S. dollar this week?”
“ Mario, do you think China will report a good number for trade surplus
this month?”
The TV anchor and the reporters on site fi re questions from every
angle, and you need to have the answers at your fi ngertips. They expect
you to know, or you have no business being on the biggest stage in interna-
tional fi nance.
H ow ridiculous it would be if I were to fake an answer like “I think
infl ation in Singapore is going to hit 65% next year.” I would be laughed off
the chair.
So I had to study. In fact, to be in that three-minute hot seat, I had to
study for three hours. That ’s right: three full hours of study for three min-
utes on CNBC.
ffpprreeff..iinndddd xxiivv 0033//1122//1122 44::3333 PPMM

Preface xv
T hankfully, I did well. In fact, I did so well that I was called back, again
and again. CNBC has three major shows that cover the fi nancial markets.
The early morning segment is called S quawk Box, in the early afternoon
it’ s called Capital Connection, and the evening’ s slot is called W orldwide
Exchange .
E ventually I was invited to appear on all three major shows. In fact, I
was then asked to be a guest host on Worldwide Exchange . As guest host,
I sat with the news anchor and instead of being there for three minutes, I
would be there for a full hour.
My job was to have a conversation with some of the most brilliant
fi nancial minds on the planet who would come in and take their place on
the hot seat. As I warmed up to the new role as a guest host, I had an impor-
tant revelation. The job was getting easier. In fact, I didn ’t have to study
when I was guest host.
Do you know why? Because this time, it was my turn to ask the all-
important question, “So, Jack, what’ s your view on the U.S. dollar this week?”
This was my revelation: As you get better, it gets easier.
S o, my friend, don’ t wish that it were easier, wish that you were better.
Kaizen is the Japanese word for improvement. When we embrace
kaizen in any endeavor, mastery is bound to be the result.
My kaizen approach to forex trading has enabled me to be a consistently
profi table trader. Today, I am living the dream of traveling and spreading the
message of profi table forex trading everywhere I go. I’ ve even had the privi-
lege to coach forex traders in some of the largest banks in the world. Forex
trading has given me this new life, and I know that it can do the same for you.
AUDIENCE
T oday the Forex Market is considered the largest fi nancial market in the
world. With that famous tagline, thousands of books have sprung up giving
people insights into this amazing market. I did not write this book with the
intention of adding to the vast list of global resources already available on
the topic of forex.
M y inspiration for this book is drawn from three specifi c groups of
people:
1. A ll forex traders around the world. It is my humble wish that this book
will become the platinum standard in forex education. The rich con-
tent here will suit you regardless of which stage you are in your trading
career: beginner, intermediate, or advanced. Pay particular attention
to Chapter 5, which puts you through a fun and interesting quiz. At the
ffpprreeff..iinndddd xxvv 0033//1122//1122 44::3333 PPMM

xvi PREFACE
end of the quiz, you will discover which one of the fi ve categories of
traders you belong to. If you stick to the strategies pertinent to your
profi le, you will be pleasantly surprised by the results.
2. F inance and business professionals who are not currently involved in
the forex market. You may be involved in equities, fi xed-income instru-
ments, or commodities. An understanding of global fi nance and forex
movements will greatly help you in your decision making. Remember,
capital fl ows into a country fi rst, before it fl ows into any specifi c asset
class. An understanding of the forex market puts you in prime position
to anticipate these fl ows. Chapter 3 is dedicated to business corpora-
tions that must understand the importance of hedging. Hedging helps
corporations gain certainty of price, even when payments are made or
received in different currencies. Hedging thus helps corporations to
mitigate the foreign exchange risk exposure.
3. O rdinary folks outside of the fi nance industry who are looking to cre-
ate a powerful second income. With a potent combination of unprec-
edented liquidity and sovereign debt levels in the world today, there
truly has never been a better time to get involved in forex. I ask you
humbly to consider this opportunity.
OVERVIEW OF THE CONTENTS
The book is broken into two parts:
Part One: Forex Is a Game
P art One of this book is divided into fi ve chapters, and it centers on the
core description of forex as a game. We discover insights on the rules of
the game, the major players, and how money is made.
Chapter 1 introduces the forex market. It begins by describing the total
daily turnover and the seven major currency pairs. It then explains how to
read a forex quote and how prices move. The chapter ends with a frame-
work of how margin and leverage are employed in a forex trade.
C hapter 2 focuses on how money is made in a forex trade. We learn
about long and short and the three points in every trade. We then move to
the four big reasons that cause currencies to move and get a grasp of the
fraction theory. Chapter 2 ends with an understanding of market structure.
C hapters 3 and 4 cover the six major players in the forex market and
the numerous advantages associated with trading the market. Some of the
major players include central banks, commercial banks, multinational
ffpprreeff..iinndddd xxvvii 0033//1122//1122 44::3333 PPMM

Preface xvii
c ompanies, and retail traders. We also get a glimpse of three of the biggest
blow-ups in proprietary trading in banking history.
Chapter 5 is devoted to discovering your unique profi le in trading.
It includes a profi ling test to help you fi nd out how your personality can
help or hurt your trading style. There are essentially fi ve types of traders:
scalper, day trader, swing trader, position trader, and mechanical trader. By
the end of this chapter, you will know which group you belong to.
Part Two: Strategies to Win the Game
Part Two is also divided into fi ve chapters. Each chapter covers strategies
for the fi ve profi les of scalper, day trader, swing trader, position trader, and
mechanical trader.
Chapter 6 covers two strategies for scalpers, called the rapid fi re
and the piranha. These strategies are used on the shortest time frames,
namely the minute chart and the 5-minute chart.
Chapter 7 covers four strategies for day traders. The fi rst two strategies
are focused on breakouts while the next two are centered purely on trading
the news. A unique way of trading the news, called the Rule of 20, is also
discussed here. All four strategies are employed using the 15-minute and
30-minute time frame.
C hapter 8 covers fi ve strategies for swing traders. As swing traders
typically exit their positions within two to fi ve days, the time frames used
for the strategies are longer than the day traders. Hence, all fi ve of the
swing trading strategies are used on the 1-hour and the 4-hour time frame.
Chapter 9 covers three strategies for position traders. The fi rst one,
swap and fl y, takes advantage of the interest rate differentials between the
currencies and aims to earn maximum returns by holding on to positions
for an extended period of time. The next two strategies are used specifi -
cally for the two most popular commodities in the world: oil and gold.
The fi nal chapter covers three strategies for mechanical traders.
Traders in this category are oblivious to the passing of time. This is why all
strategies discussed here employ three different time frames from the other
categories: the 5-minute chart, the 15-minute chart, and the daily chart.

CHAPTER 1
How to Play the
Game
T
his chapter presents some of the essentials that you must know
when you start trading the forex market. In it we describe the seven
major currency pairs that are most commonly traded worldwide and
explain how prices move. We also discuss the yen factor, which quotes
forex prices in two decimal places as opposed to the normal four. The fi nal
part of the chapter defi nes the value of a pip and explains how margin and
leverage affect trades.
THE FOREX GAME
T he forex game has changed much over the years. Today, it is undis-
putedly the largest fi nancial market in the world, with a daily trading
volume in excess of USD4 trillion. The authoritative source on global forex
market activity is the Triennial Central Bank Survey of Foreign Exchange
and Derivatives Market Activity, published by the Bank for International
Settlements (BIS).
Available offi cial fi gures for daily forex turnover are taken from the last
survey done in April 2010. Fifty-three central banks and monetary authori-
ties participated in the survey, collecting information from 1,309 market
participants.
An excerpt from the BIS report reads:
The 2010 triennial survey shows another significant increase in
global foreign exchange market activity since the last survey
in 2007, following the unprecedented rise in activity between 2004
and 2007. Global foreign exchange market turnover was 20% higher
in April 2010 than in April 2007. This increase brought average
3

daily turnover to USD4.0 trillion (from USD3.3 trillion) at current
exchange rates.
http://www.bis.org/publ/rpfx10.htm
At the heart of the report, an interesting fact stood out. Apparently,
48% of the growth was in spot transactions, which represented 37% of
the total turnover of forex transactions worldwide. Spot transactions
are mostly traded by retail traders—that’ s everyday people like you and
me. This group is rapidly expanding and is expected to contribute an
even larger portion of total forex turnover by the time the next survey
is out.
This Triennial Survey is done once every three years, and the next
one is due in April 2013. Publication of preliminary results will follow four
months later. The offi cial fi gure for daily forex turnover is expected to be
well over USD4 trillion at that time. Figure 1.1 shows the breakdown of the
daily turnover by instrument.

T he USD4 trillion daily turnover on the forex market is truly staggering.
According to the April 2010 BIS Triennial Survey, this fi gure is:
• More than 23 times the average daily turnover of global equity markets
• More than 40 times the annual turnover of world gross domestic product
I n fact, in the latest BIS Quarterly Review , dated March 2012, Morten
Bech, senior economist in the Monetary and Economics Department of BIS,
estimated that “global FX activity was around $4.7 trillion a day on average
in October 2011, compared with $4.0 trillion reported by the latest triennial
central bank survey of foreign exchange activity conducted in April 2010.”
Imagine that: USD4.7 trillion in a day on average in October 2011!
It certainly won ’t be surprising to see the fi gure top the USD5 trillion
mark when the offi cial fi gures are released from the April 2013 survey. The
good news for the retail trader is this: As a result of increasing demand,
transaction costs such as spreads have decreased, technology offerings
have improved, and value-added services on forex brokerage fi rms have
exploded.
T here truly never has been a better time to start trading on the forex
market. This exciting message is further reinforced by the record num-
bers of everyday folks—people like you and me—who continue to jump
onboard the forex bandwagon at an accelerated pace.
FOREX AND THE SEVEN MAJORS
Foreign exchange, or forex for short, is a market where one currency is
exchanged for another. This is the reason why forex is quoted in currency
pairs. Each world currency is given a three-letter code as set out by the
International Standards Organization (ISO) and governed by the ISO 4217.
The eight most commonly traded currencies are:
1. U SD (U.S. dollar)
2. E UR (euros)
3. G BP (Great Britain pound)
4. A UD (Australian dollar)
5. J PY (Japanese yen)
6. C HF (Swiss franc)
7. C AD (Canadian dollar)
8. N ZD (New Zealand dollar)
cc0011..iinndddd 55 0033//1122//1122 99::5533 AAMM

6 FOREX IS A GAME
The eight most commonly traded currencies form the seven major
currency pairs. These seven majors dominate the forex market in terms of
traded volume. Since January 2012, it is estimated that the seven majors
account for over 85% of the daily traded volume in the forex market.
These seven major currency pairs are:
1. E UR/USD: euro versus U.S. dollar
2. U SD/JPY: U.S. dollar versus Japanese yen
3. G BP/USD: Great Britain pound versus U.S. dollar
4. A UD/USD: Australian dollar versus U.S. dollar
5. U SD/CHF: U.S. dollar versus Swiss franc
6. U SD/CAD: U.S. dollar versus Canadian dollar
7. N ZD/USD: New Zealand dollar versus U.S. dollar
F igure 1 .2 shows how much volume is contributed by the seven majors.
It also shows that the EUR/USD currency pair contributes the highest
percentage of daily traded volume, with 28%.
For all of the listed seven majors, the U.S. dollar features in either the
left-hand side or the right-hand side of the currency pair. This is why
the U.S. dollar is the most liquid currency in the forex world.
USD/CAD 4%
USD/CHF 4%
AUD/USD 5%
GBP/USD 14%
USD/JPY 17%
EUR/USD 28%
All Others 28%
0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30%

How to Play the Game 7
Reading a Forex Quote
Forex prices are quoted in currency pairs and almost always to four deci-
mal places. For example, if a forex quote is given as EUR/USD = 1.3255,
the currency on the left is termed the “base currency” while the currency
on the right is termed the “counter currency.” The base currency always
has a value of 1. In the example, the euro is the base currency while the
U.S. dollar is the counter currency. This is how we would read the forex
quote: 1 euro is equivalent to 1.3255 U.S. dollars at that point of time.
This forex quote tells us two things. First, if traders are eager to pur-
chase one unit of the base currency, they would have to pay 1.3255 U.S. dol-
lars to buy 1 euro. If, however, traders are eager to sell one unit of the base
currency, they would receive 1.3255 U.S. dollars for selling 1 euro. It is also
important to note that the exchange rate always fl uctuates with changing
market conditions. At any time, the euro can weaken or strengthen against
the U.S. dollar.
I f the EUR/USD quote moves up from 1.3255 to 1.3287, the euro is
strengthening against the U.S. dollar. However, if the EUR/USD quote
moves down from 1.3255 to 1.3138, the euro is weakening against the
U.S. dollar.
The Yen Factor
Not all forex quotes are created equal, especially when it comes to the
Japanese yen. Whenever the Japanese yen is in the counter currency,
the forex quote is given in two decimal places instead of four. Let ’s take a
look at an example.
USD / JPY = 80.55
T he quote tells us that 1 U.S. dollar is equivalent to 80.55 Japanese yen
at that point of time.
If the USD/JPY quote moves up from 80.55 to 80.87, the U.S. dollar
is strengthening against the Japanese yen. If the USD/JPY quote moves
down from 80.55 to 79.78, the U.S. dollar is weakening against the
Japanese yen.
Pip
P ip stands for “price interest point.” It is the unit of measurement to
express the change in value between two currencies.
Let ’s say that the current AUD/USD price is 1.0235. If the price rises to
1.0236 or falls to 1.0234, this is a movement of 0.0001, or 1 pip. If the current
cc0011..iinndddd 77 0033//1122//1122 99::5533 AAMM

8 FOREX IS A GAME
price of USD/JPY is 81.33, and if the price rises to 81.34 or falls to 81.32, this
is a movement of 0.01, or 1 pip.
O ne pip is thus the smallest change in value for any given forex
quote, whether it ’s quoted to two or four decimal places. Here are more
examples:
• When the EUR/USD quote moves up from 1.3255 to 1.3287, it is a
movement of 32 pips.
W hen the EUR/USD quote moves down from 1.3255 to 1.3138, it is
a movement of 117 pips.
• W hen the USD/CHF quote moves up from 0.9148 to 0.9263, it is a
movement of 115 pips.
W hen the USD/CHF quote moves down from 0.9148 to 0.9126, it is
a movement of 22 pips.
• When the USD/JPY quote moves up from 80.55 to 80.87, it is a
movement of 32 pips.
W hen the USD/JPY quote moves down from 80.55 to 79.78, it is a
movement of 77 pips.
Pipette M any brokers today extend forex quotes beyond the standard
four and two decimal places, to fi ve and three decimal places respec-
tively. As an example, a broker could quote USD/CAD as 1.00583. If the
USD/CAD quote rises to either 1.00584 or falls to 1.00582, the movement
is termed 1 pipette.
S imilarly, if USD/JPY is quoted as 81.338 and if the currency pair
rises to either 81.339 or falls to 81.337, the movement is termed 1 pipette
as well.
How Do We Calculate the Value Of One Pip? Different curren-
cies have different values. Hence, the value of a pip is different for each
currency.
The fi rst thing to take note of when calculating pip value is that for
most forex quotes, particularly the seven majors, the U.S. dollar is either
the base currency or the counter currency.
In the USD/CHF quote, the U.S. dollar is the base currency. In the
AUD/USD quote, the U.S. dollar is the counter currency.
Let ’s calculate the pip value for each example, starting with the
U.S. dollar as the base currency (see Examples 1.1 and 1.2 ).
cc0011..iinndddd 88 0033//1122//1122 99::5533 AAMM

How to Play the Game 9
EXAMPLE 1.1: VALUE OF 1 PIP
Let ’s take the current price of USD/CHF as 0.9235. The smallest move-
ment for a pip is thus 0.0001.
The formula for calculating pip value is:
Pip value = Smallest decimal move/Current exchange rate
= 0.0001 / 0.9235
= 0.000108
The value of 1 pip when the USD/CHF is at 0.9235 is USD 0.000108.
To determine the pip value for Japanese yen pairs, let’ s take a look at
the next example.
If the current price of USD/JPY is 81.55, the smallest movement for
a pip is 0.01.
The formula for calculating pip value is:
Pip value = Smallest decimal move/Current exchange rate
= 0.01 / 81.55
= 0.000123
The value of 1 pip when the USD/JPY is at 81.55 is USD 0.000123.
EXAMPLE 1.2: VALUE OF 1 PIP
Let ’s take a look at how pip value is determined when the U.S. dollar is
the counter currency.
If the AUD/USD is now 1.0237, then:
Pip value = Smallest decimal move/Current exchange rate
= 0.0001 / 1.0237
= 0.00009768
The value of 1 pip when the AUD/USD is at 1.0237 is AUD 0.00009768.
Take note that in this case, the value of 1 pip is quoted in Australian dol-
lars (AUD).
To fi nd out the value of 1 pip in U.S. dollars, we simply take the cur-
rent pip value and multiply it by the current exchange rate:
Pip value ( in USD ) = Pip value ( in base currency ) × Current exchange rate
= 0.00009768 × 1.0237
= 0.0001
Thus, the value of 1 pip when the AUD/USD is at 1.0237 is USD
0.0001.
Although the process may look complicated, the good news is that
every single broker you trade with will calculate this value automatically
for you.

Lot Size Most forex brokers today provide up to four categories of lot
sizes for the trader. These are:
1. S tandard lot
2. M ini lot
3. M icro lot
4. N ano lot
A standard lot is defi ned as 100,000 units of the base currency.
For an example, when you buy 1 standard lot of EUR/USD, you are
purchasing 100,000 euros with U.S. dollars.
A mini lot is defi ned as 10,000 units of the base currency.
For an example, when you buy 1 mini lot of GBP/USD, you are purchasing
10,000 pounds with U.S. dollars.
A micro lot is defi ned as 1,000 units of the base currency. For an
example, when you buy 1 micro lot of USD/CHF, you are purchasing
1,000 U.S. dollars with Swiss francs.
A nano lot is defi ned as 100 units of the base currency. For an example,
when you buy 1 nano lot of USD/CAD, you are purchasing 100 U.S. dollars
with Canadian dollars.
T he lot size decreases by a factor of 10 from standard, to mini, to micro,
and fi nally to nano, as shown in Table 1.1 .
Standard Lot
If you trade standard lots, then, using the same values as Example 1.1 :
USD/CHF = 0.9235
Pip value = USD 0.000108
Pip value for standard lot = USD 0.000108 × 100,000
= USD 10.80

Lot Size Category Number of Units
Standard 1 00,000
Mini 1 0,000
Micro 1 ,000
Nano 1 00

How to Play the Game 11
Looking at the USD/JPY example with quotes to two decimal places:
USD/JPY = 81.55
Pip value = USD 0.000123
Pip value for standard lot = USD 0.000123 × 100,000
= USD 12.30
Using the same values as Example 1.2 :
AUD/USD = 1.0237
Pip value = AUD 0.00009768 or USD 0.0001
Pip value for standard lot = USD 0.0001 × 100,000
= USD 10
Mini Lot
If you trade mini lots instead, the value of 1 pip will decrease by a factor of 10.
Using the same values as Example 1.1 :
USD/CHF = 0.9235
Pip value = USD 0.000108
Pip value for mini lot = USD 0.000108 × 10,000
= USD 1.08
Looking at the USD/JPY example with quotes to two decimal places:
USD/JPY = 81.55
Pip value = USD 0.000123
Pip value for mini lot = USD 0.000123 × 10,000
= USD 1.23
Using the same values as Example 1.2 :
AUD/USD = 1.0237
Pip value = AUD 0.00009768 or USD 0.0001
Pip value for mini lot = USD 0.0001 × 10,000
= USD 1
LEVERAGE
F inancial success is almost always accomplished through the use of
leverage. I sum up the defi nition of leverage in four simple words: “Doing
more with less.”
I n the previous section, we talked about how the value of 1 pip dra-
matically increases when a trader trades a standard lot or even a mini lot.
cc0011..iinndddd 1111 0033//1122//1122 99::5533 AAMM

12 FOREX IS A GAME
In reality, not many retail traders are able to fork out $100,000 or $10,000 to
trade one standard or one mini lot.
This is where the forex broker steps in. Simply put, the business
model of forex brokers is to provide retail traders with leverage so
that they do not need to lay out the entire sum of $100,000 to trade one
standard lot.
L et’ s see how this works. If the broker provides you with lever-
age of 100:1, instead of $100,000, all you need to do is to pay $1,000 to
trade one standard lot. Sometimes the $1,000 is referred to as margin. It
is also the basis of how brokers refer to our trading account as a margin
account.
M argin basically allows a trader to purchase a contract without the
need to provide the full value of the contract. In the example, $1,000 was
the margin required for you to trade $100,000 on a leverage of 100:1.
Using a simple formula:
Margin required = Lot size / Leverage
Hence, for the example:
Margin required = $ 100,000 / 100
= $ 1,000
Margin percentage = Margin amount / Lot size
= $ 1,000 / $ 100,000
= 1 %
S imilarly, if the broker provides you with leverage of 50:1, instead of
$100,000, all you need to do is to lay out $2,000 to trade one standard lot.
Margin percentage in this case is then 2%.
I n summary, the higher the leverage provided by the broker, the less
you need to pay out to trade one standard lot.
Table 1.2 summarizes the leverage and subsequent margin require-
ments when you trade.
TABLE 1.2 Margin and Leverage
Margin Required Maximum Leverage
5% 20:1
3% 33:1
2% 50:1
1% 100:1
0.5% 200:1
0.2% 500:1

How to Play the Game 13
From the table, it would be logical for us to conclude that we should
choose the highest leverage available, since that would require us to pay
out the least amount of cash to trade one standard lot.
This is not true.
Risk of Excessive Leverage
L everage is a double-edged sword. While it has the potential to magnify
a trader’ s gains, it certainly has the potential to magnify losses as well. In
fact, the greater the leverage, the greater the risk.
Let ’s take a look at an example.
Both Trader A and Trader B open an account with a broker and start
trading with a capital of USD10,000. Trader A uses leverage of 100:1 while
Trader B uses leverage of 10:1. Both traders then decide to sell EUR/USD
because the ongoing sovereign debt crisis is putting some pressure on
the euro.
Trader A ’s total contract size is 100 × $10,000 = 1 million. This equals to
10 standard lots. Trader B ’s total contract size is 10 × $10,000 = $100,000.
This equals to 1 standard lot.
F or EUR/USD, we learned that 1 pip equals USD10 for one standard lot.
If the trade goes against them by 50 pips, both traders will incur these
losses:
Trader A: ( 10 lots ) × ( 50 pips ) × ( $ 10 / pip ) = USD5,000
Trader B: ( 1 lot ) × ( 50 pips ) × ( $ 10 / pip ) = USD500
The USD5,000 loss represents 50% of Trader A ’s trading capital, but the
USD500 loss represents just 5% of Trader B ’s trading capital.
Take a look at Table 1.3 for the summary of two traders who trade with
different leverage.
In conclusion, while leverage has the potential to magnify your profi ts,
it also has the power to amplify your losses. It cuts both ways. After the

global fi nancial crisis of 2008 to 2010, U.S. regulators moved to regulate the
forex industry there. On October 18, 2010, the National Futures Association
passed rules to limit the amount of leverage retail forex brokers can
provide. The rules limited leverage to 50:1 on major currencies and only
20:1 on minor currencies.
SUMMARY
T he forex market is the largest fi nancial market in the world, trading in excess
of USD4 trillion in a single day. Although hundreds of currencies change
hands every day, most of the trading centers on seven major currency pairs.
The currency pair that handles the highest volume of trade is the EUR/USD.
A forex quote is always displayed in pairs. Examples include
EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and AUD/CHF. The currency on the left is called the
base currency while the currency on the right is called the counter cur-
rency. Almost all currency pairs are quoted to four decimal places, except
when the Japanese yen appears in the counter currency. In such cases, the
forex quote is displayed in two decimal places.
A pip is the smallest price movement in a currency pair. If the EUR/USD
moves up from 1.3435 to 1.3436, this movement is called 1 pip. Similarly, if
the same quote moves down from 1.3435 to 1.3434, the movement is also
called 1 pip. Whenever the U.S. dollar appears as a counter currency, 1 pip
earns the trader USD10 for one standard lot.
Some forex brokers go one step further and quote prices to fi ve deci-
mal places. For such brokers, the EUR/USD quote could be seen as 1.34358.
It is important for us to take note that the fi fth decimal place is not called
a pip but a pipette. Quotes that have the Japanese yen as the counter cur-
rency are displayed in three decimal places instead of two in these cases.
Brokers provide retail traders with leverage to trade the forex market.
Without leverage, a trader would need to pay out USD100,000 to trade one
standard lot of currencies. With a 100:1 leverage, a trader would need to put
up only 1/100th of the entire amount, or USD1,000. This amount is called
margin. Margin basically allows a trader to purchase a contract without the
need to provide the full value of the contract.
T he higher the leverage employed, the smaller the margin required to
trade one standard lot. Some brokers even offer leverage up to 500:1. This
means traders need only USD200 to control USD100,000 worth of currencies.
Leverage is a double-edged sword. Although it helps to magnify a trad-
er ’s gains, it can also amplify a trader ’s losses. Hence, it is imperative that
traders fully understand the pros and cons of leverage before deciding the
appropriate amount of leverage to employ.

CHAPTER 2
How Money Is
Made in the Game
T
his chapter starts with an explanation of how currencies are bought
or sold in the market. We then decode a forex contract for long
and short. The chapter also explains the three critical points in
every trade and points out the bid/ask spread that brokers charge for
each trade. This chapter also presents the four reasons that cause cur-
rencies to fl uctuate on a daily basis. We then turn to the fraction the-
ory, which helps us to decide on a long or short trade. The chapter ends
with an explanation of how charts are read and how market structure is
identifi ed.
BUY LOW, SELL HIGH
F orex traders make money by speculating on the movement of currency
rates. There are only two ways to do this. The fi rst way is to buy, expecting
prices to rise. The second way is to sell, expecting prices to fall.
Buy
T he current rate for AUD/USD is now 1.0325. You enter into a buy posi-
tion because you expect the Australian dollar to strengthen further
against the U.S. dollar. A buy trade is termed a “long position” in the
forex market.
After three hours, the AUD/USD rate is at 1.0375. You were right, and
you made 50 pips on this trade. Another way of saying this is that your
long position took profi t. Let’ s have a look at Example 2.1 for an exact
contract.

16 FOREX IS A GAME
EXAMPLE 2.1: BUY AUD/USD AT 1.0325
Let ’s assume that you buy 100,000 Australian dollars for this contract, or
one standard lot. Since the exchange rate is 1.0325, you pay AUD100,000
with USD103,250.
After three hours, the AUD/USD rate goes up to 1.0375. You then sell
the AUD100,000 and receive USD103,750. This transaction nets you a
total profi t of USD500.
Action AUD U SD
Buy AUD100,000 at the current 1 100,000 2 103,250
AUD/USD rate of 1.0325.
3 hours later, sell AUD100,000 2 100,000 1 103,750
at the rate of 1.0375.
Total profit earned USD 500 0 1 500
If you did not use leverage, you had to fork out USD103,250 to make
USD500. Percentage-wise, your return is only 0.484% (500/103,250).
However, if you utilized leverage of 100:1 provided by the broker,
you would only have needed to lay out margin of USD1,032.50 to buy
AUD100,000. Percentage-wise, your return would have been a whopping
48.4% (500/1,032.50).
Sell
T he current rate for EUR/USD is at 1.3142. You enter into a sell position
because you expect the euro to further weaken against the U.S. dollar. A
sell trade is termed a “short position” in the forex market.
After two hours, the EUR/USD rate is at 1.3112. You were right, and
you made 30 pips on this trade. Another way of saying this is that your
short position took profi t. Let’ s have a look at Example 2.2 for an exact
contract.
EXAMPLE 2.2: SELL EUR/USD AT 1.3142
Let ’s assume that you sell 200,000 euros for this contract, or two stan-
dard lots. Since the exchange rate is 1.3142, you receive USD262,840 for
200,000 euros. After two hours, the EUR/USD rate goes down to 1.3112.
You then buy back the 200,000 euros and pay USD262,240. This
transaction nets you a total profi t of USD600.

2 hours later, buy back 200,000 1 200,000 2 262,240
euros at the rate of 1.3112.
Total profit earned USD 600 0 1 600
Similarly, If no leverage was employed, you had to utilize 200,000
euros, or USD262,840, to make USD600. Percentage-wise, this represents
a return of only 0.228% (600/262,840).
However, if you utilized leverage of 100:1 provided by the broker,
you would only have needed to lay out margin of USD2,628.40 to sell
200,000 euros. Percentage-wise, your return would have been a whop-
ping 22.8% (600/2,628.40).
THREE POINTS IN EVERY TRADE
W hen you execute a position, there are essentially three points in every
trade: entry price, profi t target, and stop loss.
The entry price is defi ned as the price at which a trade is triggered. The
profi t target is defi ned as the price where the trade exits with a profi t.
The stop loss is defi ned as the price where the trade exits with a loss.
Let ’s use an example for both a long and a short position.
Long Position
L et’ s take the current GBP/USD price as 1.5743. Because you expect
the pound to appreciate against the U.S. dollar, you enter into a long
position.
Y ou decide to take a profi t of 30 pips and a stop loss of 30 pips. Once
these values are locked down in the broker ’s platform, only two things can
happen: The trade will hit either the profi t target or the stop loss.
In this example:
Entry price 5 1.5743
Stop loss 5 1.5713
Profi t target 5 1.5773

How Money Is Made in the Game 23
T he greatest lesson in this segment is this: Always put a stop loss for
every trade. To most traders, having a profi t target is second nature, but
hardly anyone thinks about putting a stop loss. The purpose of a stop loss
is simple yet critical. It is essentially a level that tells you to exit the trade
with an acceptable loss because the trade is not going your way.
Far too many times in my career as a trader and coach, I have seen
countless traders blow up their accounts simply because they refuse to put
a stop loss for every trade. When it comes to trading the forex market, we
will never be right all the time. The purpose of a stop loss is to help us, not
harm us.
Traders run the risk of blowing up their entire account by leaving a trade
“naked,” or without a stop loss. Do not adopt this practice. Interestingly
enough, the same group of traders who blow up their accounts by not plac-
ing a stop loss is the same group who walks away from the forex market
thinking that it ’s risky.
BID/ASK SPREAD
S o far, we have been talking about forex prices as a single quote. In real-
ity, there are actually two quotes for each price: the bid price and the ask
price. The bid price is the price at which the trader selects to sell. It is also
the price at which the broker is willing to buy.
T he ask price is the price at which the trader selects to buy. It is also
the price at which the broker is willing to sell. The difference between the
bid price and the ask price is known as the spread. The spread is the trans-
action fee that the broker charges for executing a trade.
In Figure 2.11 , the EUR/USD quote is given as 1.3089/1.3091.
This fi gure tells us that the bid price is 1.3089 and the ask price is
1.3091. We can also infer that the spread is 2 pips. This means that the bro-
ker FXPRIMUS charges a transaction fee of 2 pips for every trade that is
executed on its platform.
If you believe that the EUR/USD will rise, you would click “Buy,” and
the trade will be triggered on the ask price of 1.3091. If you believe that the
EUR/USD will fall, you would click “Sell,” and the trade will be triggered
on the bid price of 1.3089.
T here are three important facts for us to take note when it comes to spread:
1. T he spread is the only transaction fee incurred when trading on the
broker ’s platform.

FIGURE 2.11 EUR/USD Quote on FXPRIMUS Market Watch

2. T he spread is charged for every “round turn.” This means that only 2
pips are charged for a complete transaction of buying fi rst and selling
later or selling fi rst and buying later.
3. T he smaller the spread, the less the market needs to move in your
favor to register a profi t.
T ypically, spreads on more liquid pairs are smaller, with illiquid pairs
refl ecting higher spreads. Since every forex quote is accompanied by both
the bid and the ask price, when you execute a buy or long position, you
enter on the ask price and exit on the bid price.
Figure 2.12 shows an example. To earn 30 pips, the market has to move
32 pips.
W ith a spread of 2 pips on the EUR/USD, a long position is executed on
the ask price of 1.3127. To make 30 pips profi t, the market has to move 32
pips to cover the pip spread that is paid to the broker. The long position is
then exited on the bid price of 1.3157.
S imilarly, when you execute a sell or short position, you enter on the
bid price and exit on the ask price. Figure 2 .13 shows an example. To earn
30 pips, the market has to move 33 pips.
With a spread of 3 pips on the GBP/USD, a short position is executed
on the bid price of 1.5968. To make 30 pips profi t, the market has to move
33 pips to cover the pip spread that is paid to the broker. The short position
is then exited on the ask price of 1.5938.

N ow that we have a better understanding of how money is made on
the forex market, let’ s take a look at reasons that cause currency pairs to
move up and down.
WHAT CAUSES THE PRICE OF CURRENCIES
TO FLUCTUATE?
T he value of a currency rises or falls in relation to the forces of demand
and supply. When the demand for a currency exceeds the available sup-
ply, the value of the currency tends to rise. Conversely, when the supply
cc0022..iinndddd 2255 0066//1122//1122 22::2233 PPMM

26 FOREX IS A GAME
of a currency exceeds the available demand, the value of the currency
tends to fall.
L et’ s look at four of the most important factors that cause prices of cur-
rencies to fl uctuate: economic factors, political factors, natural disasters,
and speculation.
Economic Factors
When traders look at economic factors, they are searching for one key
word: growth. When growth is non-existent or negative, the value of the
country’ s currency tends to fall. This is because the currency is not viewed
as attractive or valuable, and traders start selling it.
Conversely, when growth is positive, the value of the country ’s cur-
rency tends to rise. This is because more traders end up buying the
currency. Traders look at several economic factors to gain an idea of how a
country is performing. Let ’s take a look at a couple of them.
Consumer Spending E veryone needs to spend, whether on goods or
services. Consumer spending directly affects the money supply of a coun-
try, which directly affects the country ’s currency and subsequent exchange
rate with other nations. When consumer spending increases, the general
health of the economy increases, and subsequent demand for the country ’s
currency will lift its value against other currencies.
On the fl ip side, when consumer spending declines, the economy fal-
ters and the general sentiment of the currency turns bad. This causes the
country ’s currency to fall against other currencies.
As shown in this report:
“The pound rose for a second day versus the dollar after the
government ’s quarterly economic growth report showed consumer
spending rose more than forecast, boosting speculation the country
will avoid a recession.”
Bloomberg Businessweek , February 24, 2012
Current Account Balance The current account balance is a mea-
sure of how much money is fl owing out of the country compared with
how much is fl owing in from foreign sources. If there is a net infl ow of
funds, the country is said to have a current account surplus. If there is
a net outfl ow of funds, the country is said to have a current account
defi cit.
cc0022..iinndddd 2266 0066//1122//1122 22::2233 PPMM

How Money Is Made in the Game 27
Continuous records of current account defi cits may lead to a natu-
ral depreciation of a country ’s currency. This is because money for trade,
income, and aid is leaving the country to make payments in a foreign cur-
rency. The current account is made up of three components:
Current account 5 Trade balance 1 Net income 1 Unilateral transfers
The trade balance is simply the total value of exports minus the total
value of imports. Net income is defi ned as the difference between money
received and money paid out. It includes salaries, interest payments, and
dividends. Unilateral transfers include taxes, foreign aid, and one-way
gifts.
For most countries, the largest component of the current account is
generally the trade balance. As an example, the United States has expe-
rienced high current account defi cits for the last few decades primarily
because of its large trade defi cit.
As shown in this report:
“The yen weakened after official data showed Japan had a record
current account deficit in January. The yen slid 0.3 percent to 81.33
per dollar as of 8:53 am in Tokyo. It declined 0.2 percent to 106.85
per euro.”
Bloomberg Businessweek , March 8, 2012
I n Chapter 7, we will discuss more specifi c economic news that affects
the currency market and how to trade such news for profi t.
Political Factors
W hen a country is mired in a political crisis, demand for its goods and
services is affected. These problems would cause foreign capital coming
into the country to cease and also cause foreign capital to leave the coun-
try. The combined effect leaves the home currency weaker against other
currencies.
An upcoming election can also have a big impact on a country ’s cur-
rency. Traders typically view elections as events that give rise to potential
political instability and uncertainty, which equates to greater volatility in
the currency.
This effect is more strongly felt when governments change hands.
A new government often signifi es a change in ideology and management,
which translates to new rules, new laws, and new policies that ultimately
will affect the value of the currency.
cc0022..iinndddd 2277 0066//1122//1122 22::2233 PPMM

28 FOREX IS A GAME
T he change in the currency value could be either positive or negative.
Political parties that make a stand on promoting economic growth and
reining in high government debt levels tend to boost a currency ’s value.
As shown in this report:
“Egypt ’s pound fell on Wednesday to its lowest level against the U.S.
dollar since January 2005 after the biggest anti-government protests
of President Hosni Mubarak ’s three-decade rule. The pound fell as
low as 5.830 against the U.S. currency.”
Reuters, January 26, 2011
Natural Disasters
Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, and fl oods, can bring
about devastating effects to a country. Loss of life, damaged infrastructure,
and abrupt changes to daily living all have a negative impact on the nation’ s
currency.
Economic output will also be severely affected because of the damage
caused. Money that could have otherwise been used to drive economic initia-
tives is now channeled towards rebuilding supply chains and infrastructure.
T he problem is further compounded by a decrease in consumer spend-
ing and loss of consumer and investor confi dence. Ironically, other nations
may benefi t from the tragedy because of a jump in import orders from the
disaster-stricken nation. All of these factors combined take a toll on
the currency of the nation.
As shown in these reports:
“Australia ’s currency fell to the lowest level as confidence about
growth prospects for the country waned in the wake of heavy flooding
in the state of Queensland. The AUDUSD fell 0.5% to buy 99.60 U.S.
cents, adding to a loss of 2.5% this week.”
Market Watch , January 6, 2012
“The New Zealand dollar declined in the Asian session on Tuesday
after Christchurch, New Zealand’ s second-largest city was struck by
a strong earthquake. NZD/USD fell from 0.7634 to 0.7550 extending
its losses further to just below 0.7500. NZD/USD ’s level of 0.74 was
last seen on December 28, 2012.”

“Indonesia ’s rupiah fell to its lowest level in almost three weeks after
northwestern Indonesia was hit by a magnitude 8.7 earthquake.
Indonesia ’s rupiah weakened 0.2 percent to 9,205 per dollar after
strengthening 0.4 percent before the quake. It touched 9,208, the
weakest level since March 23.”
Bloomberg Businessweek , April 11, 2012
Speculation
Speculators trade the forex market purely for profi t. There are basically
two categories of speculators in the market: retail traders and hedge funds.
On average, more than 90% of the daily trading volume in the forex market
is speculative in nature.
Speculative moves are sometimes called “smart money” or “hot
money” because these moves are the fi rst to move in and out of coun-
tries. As an example, if speculators believe that a country’ s economy has
expanded too much and is in danger of overheating, they may get out of
the currency in anticipation of cooling measures by the government. This
would cause more supply than demand for the currency, causing it to
depreciate.
One of the world ’s most remembered speculative plays on the
forex market happened on September 16, 1992, also known as Black
Wednesday. On that fateful day, currency speculator George Soros bet
heavily against the pound and made USD1 billion in the process. Two
weeks prior to Black Wednesday, currency speculators, including Soros,
sold billions of pounds, hoping to buy them back cheaply and profi t on
the difference.
The British government decided to intervene by hiking interests
rates to 12%. The Treasury also tried to prop up the pound by spending
£27 billion of reserves. However, the government measures were all but
futile.
On the evening of September 16, the British Conservative govern-
ment announced its exit from the European exchange rate mecha-
nism (ERM), conceding defeat that it could not hold the British pound/
Deutsche mark fl oor of 2.778. Within a few hours of the announcement,
the pound tumbled 3% and was down more than 12% within three weeks.
In 1997, the UK Treasury estimated the cost of Black Wednesday to be
GBP3.4 billion.

FRACTION THEORY
Let ’s now take a look at the fraction theory, which helps us ascertain long
or short trades. Let ’s take a look at the EUR/USD currency pair. Instead
of writing it in the normal quote of EUR/USD, we write it in the form of a
fraction like this:
EUR
USD
I n this fraction, the euro is the numerator while the U.S. dollar is the
denominator. If the numerator becomes bigger while the denominator
keeps constant, the entire fraction becomes bigger. This means that if the
euro strengthens for whatever reason, the EUR/USD currency pair will
head higher. The euro can strengthen for a variety of reasons, and we dis-
cuss some of the scenarios throughout the book.
Similarly, if the denominator becomes bigger while the numerator
keeps constant, the entire fraction becomes smaller. This means that if the
U.S. dollar strengthens for whatever reason, the EUR/USD currency pair
will head lower. The crux of the fraction theory is in pairing the strongest
currency against the weakest currency at any point of time.
If we pair the strongest currency in the numerator against the weakest
currency in the denominator, we get a strong uptrend. Our job in this case
is to go long. If we pair the weakest currency in the numerator against the
strongest currency in the denominator, we get a strong downtrend. Our job
in this case is to go short.
Here ’s an example of a strong/weak pairing:
On April 3, 2012, Federal Reserve policy makers announced that they
would consider additional stimulus only if the economy lost momentum or
if infl ation stayed below the 2% target. This contrasted with their January
meeting minutes, in which some policy makers saw the economy requiring
additional action “before long.” The Federal Open Market Committee min-
utes were more hawkish than expected and caught the market by surprise,
which strengthened the U.S. dollar.
O n the same day, Spain held its bond auction program. The auction
proved to be a huge disappointment as Spain managed to sell only 2.69
billion euros out of a maximum target of 3.5 billion euros. Additionally,
Spanish credit-default swaps widened out to 450 basis points—the highest
reading in three months. This event weakened the euro.
U sing fraction theory to explain these events, we can say that the euro
weakened because of Spain’ s disappointing bond auction and the U.S. dol-
lar strengthened because of the hawkish stance by the Federal Reserve.
This combined action caused the EUR/USD to plummet, free-falling 300
pips in one day (see Figure 2.14 ).

READING THE CHARTS
T here are three types of charts which traders use on the broker’ s
p latform. The three charts include line chart, bar chart, and candlestick
chart.
Line Chart
T he line chart is plotted by connecting the closing prices over a specifi c
time frame. With a simple line, the price trend of a particular currency can
be seen. The line chart is applicable for all currency pairs, across all time
frames. As a trader, it is important to select the time frame that you are
comfortable with. A short time frame can help you to spot minor trends for
quick profi ts, while a longer time frame can help you to align yourself with
the dominant trend.
T he simplicity of the line chart comes with one glaring drawback:
Because all the line ever records is the closing price, traders are not able
to see any drastic moves prior to the close of the period. Hence, traders
are not able to utilize vital market information to aid their decision-making
process.

frame.

Bar Chart
A bar chart gives slightly more information than a line chart because it
records the open, high, low, and close of the market price for the currency
pair. Unlike the line chart, which gives data at only one point in time, the
cc0022..iinndddd 3322 0066//1122//1122 22::2233 PPMM

How Money Is Made in the Game 33
bar chart offers more data about the price changes during the selected
time frame. Bar charts are sometimes referred to as OHLC charts, because
they capture the price for open, high, low, and close.
Figure 2.17 shows an example of a price bar.
The OHLC readings on bar charts are:
OPEN: The horizontal line on the left stands for the opening price of
the currency pair in a selected time period.
HIGH: The top point of the vertical line shows the highest price of the
currency pair during that time period.
LOW: The bottom point of the vertical line shows the lowest price of
the currency pair during that time period.
CLOSE: The horizontal line on the right shows the closing price of the
currency pair in the selected time period.
The individual vertical bars in the chart (low and high) indicate the
currency pair ’s trading range as a whole. Depending on the time frame
selected, bar charts can summarize price activity over the past minute,
hour, day, or even month.

Candlestick Chart
C andlestick charts were invented by the Japanese in the 1700s to study
the movements in the price of rice on Japanese commodity exchanges.
Candlestick charts show the same information as bar charts but in a more
visually appealing way.
Take a look at the two candlesticks in Figure 2.20 .

FIGURE 2.20 Bull and Bear Candlesticks
The OHLC readings are the same as with bar charts. Please see the
explanatory note before Figure 2.17 for a defi nition of each reading.
A candlestick is considered bullish if the closing price is higher than
the opening price. A candlestick is considered bearish if the closing price
is lower than the opening price. In Figure 2.20, the candlestick on the left is
considered bullish and the one on the right is considered bearish.
The “real body” of the candlestick represents the range between the
opening price and the closing price for a particular time frame. Real bodies
can be either long or short.
The “wicks,” or shadows, above and below the candlestick represent
the highest and lowest prices reached during a particular time frame.
Shadows can be long or short.
Figure 2.21 shows a bullish candlestick on the 30-minute (M30) time
frame for the EUR/USD currency pair.
H ere’ s how we would interpret the candlestick, assuming that the
candle started forming at 11 A.M.: At 11 A.M., the price for EUR/USD was
1.3340. At 11:30 A.M., the price for EUR/USD closed higher at 1.3365. In the
half-hour period, prices fl uctuated such that the highest price reached was
1.3378 and the lowest price reached was 1.3322.
F igure 2 .22 shows a bearish candlestick on the 4-hour (H4) time frame
for the USD/JPY currency pair.
H ere’ s how we would interpret the candlestick, assuming that the can-
dle started forming at 2 P.M.: At 2 P.M., the price for USD/JPY was 81.78. At
6 P.M., the price for USD/JPY closed lower at 81.02. In the 4-hour period,
prices fl uctuated such that the highest price reached was 81.92 and the low-
est price reached was 80.87.
I n summary, reading candlesticks can give us an idea of which group—
buyers or sellers—was in control at any point of time.

MARKET STRUCTURE
Now that we understand how to read the candlesticks, let ’s turn to mar-
ket structure. The forex market has three segments: trend, range, and
breakout.
Trend
A trend can go either up or down. A trend that is moving upwards is called
an uptrend. A trend that is moving downwards is called a downtrend.
Uptrend An uptrend is identifi ed as prices having a series of higher
highs and higher lows. The highs are the peaks that prices reach intermit-
tently. The lows are the valleys that prices fall to before heading up again.
Hence, an uptrend is formed when there is a series of highs going higher
and a series of lows going higher.
Figure 2.23 shows an example of an uptrend.
F igure 2 .24 shows an example of EUR/USD (1-hour time frame) mov-
ing in an uptrend.

T raders use a trending strategy when the market is moving in an
uptrend or a downtrend. When the market is in an uptrend, we would go
long. If the market is moving in a downtrend, we would go short.
Trend Lines Trend lines are lines that are drawn to show the prevailing
direction of price. They are visual representations to give us insight into
where prices could go next. In an uptrend, we draw a trend line by joining
the signifi cant higher lows. In a downtrend, we draw the trend line by join-
ing the signifi cant lower highs.
The steeper the angle of the trend line, the stronger the momentum.
However, it is important to note that trends with steep angles are very often
short-lived.
Traders use trend lines to show three things:
1. T he direction of the trend
2. T he angle of the trend
3. T he possible chart patterns that may evolve

Understanding a Trend I n an uptrend, it is easy for us to conclude
that prices rise because there are more buyers than sellers. However, this
is not true. In the forex market, the number of contracts bought always
equals the number of contracts sold. As an example, if you want to buy fi ve
cc0022..iinndddd 4411 0066//1122//1122 22::2233 PPMM

42 FOREX IS A GAME
lots of EUR/USD, the contract must be available from someone who wants
to sell it. Conversely, if you want to sell three lots of USD/CHF, someone
must be willing to buy it.
Hence, the number of long and short positions in the forex market is
always equal. If the number of contracts bought and sold is always equal,
why do prices move up and down?
T he reason lies in the intensity of emotions between the buyers
and the sellers. In an uptrend, the buyers are in control because they
don’ t mind paying a high price. They buy high because they expect prices
to rise even higher. Sellers are nervous in an uptrend, and they agree to
sell only at a higher price. The price moves up because the intensity of
the buyers’ greed overpowers the fear and anxiety of the sellers. The
uptrend starts to fail only when buyers refuse to buy at higher prices
anymore.
In a downtrend, the sellers are in control because they don ’t mind sell-
ing at a low price. They sell low because they expect prices to drop even
further. Buyers are nervous in a downtrend, and they agree to buy only at a
discount. The price moves down because the intensity of the sellers’ greed
overpowers the buyers’ fear and anxiety. The downtrend starts to fail only
when sellers refuse to sell at lower prices anymore.
Range
A range occurs when the price is trading in a channel between two borders.
Using an analogy of a bouncing rubber ball, the price seems to “bounce”
between a fl oor and a ceiling. The ceiling is called an area of resistance
while the fl oor is called an area of support. (See Figure 2.31 .)

SUMMARY
Traders make money in the forex market by entering long and short
trades. Traders go long on a currency pair when they expect the base
currency to rise against the counter currency. Traders go short on a cur-
rency pair when they expect the base currency to fall against the counter
currency.
T here are essentially three points in every trade: entry price, stop loss,
and profi t target. The entry price is the price at which the trade is triggered.
The stop loss is a level to cut the trade with a loss when it doesn ’t go the
intended way. The profi t target is a level to exit the trade with a profi t when
the market moves the intended way.
For a long position, the profi t target is located above the entry price,
and the stop loss is placed below it. For a short position, the profi t target is
located below the entry price, and the stop loss is placed above it.
Brokers charge a fee for every long or short trade executed on their
platform. This is termed the spread. In general, spreads are lower for the
most liquid pairs, such as EUR/USD and USD/JPY. For long positions,
traders would execute on the ask price and exit on the bid price. For
short positions, traders would execute on the bid price and exit on the
ask price.
F our main factors cause forex prices to fl uctuate: economic factors,
political factors, natural disasters, and speculation. Since currencies are
quoted in pairs, the fraction theory helps traders to get a sense of the mar-
ket ’s general direction.
The main crux of the fraction theory is to pair the strongest currency
against the weakest currency at any point. If we pair the strongest cur-
rency in the numerator against the weakest currency in the denominator,
the result will be a strong uptrend. In such cases, it is prudent for traders to
go long. If we pair the weakest currency in the numerator against the stron-
gest currency in the denominator, the result will be a strong downtrend. In
such cases, it is prudent for traders to go short.
The three most popular ways to read a forex chart are: line chart,
bar chart, and candlestick chart. The candlestick chart is the most popu-
lar choice of traders worldwide for two reasons. First, the candlestick
shows the four most important price points at any given period: the open,
high, low, and close prices. Second, it shows the intensity of the fi ght
between the bulls and the bears. This is characterized by the heights
of the shadows (the highs and lows) and the lengths of the candlestick
bodies.

How Money Is Made in the Game 49
The forex market can be broken down into three simple structures:
trend, range, and breakout. An uptrend occurs when prices move in a con-
sistent fashion of higher highs and higher lows. A downtrend occurs when
prices move in a consistent fashion of lower highs and lower lows.
A range occurs when prices tend to bounce between two levels of sup-
port and resistance. A breakout occurs when prices move strongly above
the level of resistance or strongly below the level of support.

CHAPTER 3
The Six Major
Players
T
he forex market is exciting because it is made up of millions of par-
ticipants. The constant buying and selling by these participants adds
to the unprecedented liquidity found only in the forex market. This
chapter focuses on the six biggest players in the forex market. They are:
1. C entral banks
2. C ommercial and investment banks
3. M ultinational companies (MNCs)
4. I nstitutional traders
5. R etail forex brokers
6. R etail traders
We start with the central banks and the three ways in which they man-
age infl ation. We then take a sneak peek into the banking world of pro-
prietary trading and get a grip on the Volcker Rule. We also get to know
the three biggest rogue traders in history. The segment on m ultinational
companies (MNCs) presents two examples of how importers and export-
ers conduct hedging activities in the forex market to gain certainty of
price. Finally, a look into the retail crowd shows us why forex brokers
and high-frequency trading are exploding all over the world.
CENTRAL BANKS
T he main aim of central banks is to stabilize the country’ s economy. They
do this by monitoring one of the most important benchmarks in the econ-
omy: infl ation.
51
cc0033..iinndddd 5511 0033//1122//1122 44::3322 PPMM

52 FOREX IS A GAME
Infl ation is commonly defi ned as the rate at which prices of goods and
services are rising. If the central bank does not tackle infl ation swiftly, it
can lead to an erosion of purchasing power.
In most countries, infl ation is measured through the consumer price
index (CPI). The CPI is a weighted average of prices of a basket of con-
sumer goods and services. These consumer goods and services normally
include but are not limited to housing, food, transportation, recreation, edu-
cation, and medical care. A central bank controls infl ation in three ways:
1. I t regulates interest rates.
2. I t intervenes by buying or selling currencies.
3. I t regulates the reserve requirement ratio.
Let ’s explore all three in detail.
Regulate Interest Rates—Up
Central banks normally increase interest rates when infl ation is high. In
simple terms, infl ation is defi ned as “too much money chasing too few
goods, causing the price of goods to increase.” If no measures are taken
to curb infl ation, the likely effect is a weakening of the currency. When
this happens, central banks step in to raise interest rates in the hope of
curbing infl ation and strengthening the currency again.
How does raising interest rates help this process? When central banks
increase interest rates, deposit rates and lending rates in commercial
banks go up accordingly. This affects two groups of people: savers and
borrowers. Higher lending rates make the money “more expensive” to bor-
row, thus discouraging both people and businesses to take up loans. The
opposite effect is also true. Higher deposit rates encourage people and
businesses to save more than they normally would.
This combined effect causes the money supply in the system to
decrease, thereby countering the effects of infl ation. (See Examples 3.1
and 3.2 .)
EXAMPLE 3.1: PEOPLE ’S BANK OF CHINA INCREASES
INTEREST RATES
On July 6, 2011, the People ’s Bank of China (PBOC) announced a 25 basis
point increase in its interest rates—its fi fth such move in nine months.
The main reason for the increase was China ’s infl ation—consumer prices
rose 5.5% in May from a year earlier.
cc0033..iinndddd 5522 0033//1122//1122 44::3322 PPMM

The Six Major Players 53
As shown in this report:
“China ’s central bank increased interest rates for the third time this
year, making clear that taming infl ation is a top priority even as
the economy slows gently. Benchmark one-year lending rates will
be raised 25 basis points to 6.56 percent, and benchmark one-year
deposit rates will be raised 25 basis points to 3.5 percent.”
Reuters, July 6, 2011
EXAMPLE 3.2: CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA INCREASES
INTEREST RATES
On February 3, 2012, the central bank of Sri Lanka raised interest rates
by 50 basis points, its fi rst increase since 2007. The rate hike was
announced to contain credit growth and infl ation after the country’ s econ-
omy expanded the most since the 1970s.
As shown in this report:
“Sri Lanka unexpectedly raised interest rates to contain credit growth
and infl ation after the economy expanded the most since at least the
1970s. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka raised the reverse repurchase
rate to 9 percent from 8.5 percent and the repurchase rate to 7.5
percent from 7 percent.”
Bloomberg Businessweek , February 14, 2012
Regulate Interest Rates—Down
C entral banks decrease interest rates to weaken its currency. This normally
happens when infl ation rates are low. A weak currency encourages lend-
ing and ultimately stimulates growth. When central banks decrease inter-
est rates, deposit rates and lending rates in commercial banks go down
accordingly. This affects two groups of people: savers and borrowers.
Lower lending rates make the money “cheaper” to borrow, thus encour-
aging both people and businesses to take up loans. The opposite effect is
also true. Lower deposit rates discourage people and businesses to save
more than they normally would. Hence, this combined effect will cause the
money supply in the system to increase, thereby stimulating growth. (See
Examples 3.3 , 3.4 , and 3.5 .)

EXAMPLE 3.3: EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK CUTS
INTEREST RATES
On November 3, 2011, the European Central Bank (ECB) cut interest rates
by a quarter point, lowering the benchmark rate from 1.5% to 1.25%. The
main reason for the rate cut was new ECB president Mario Draghi ’s con-
cern that the Eurozone could subside into a “mild recession.”
As shown in this report:
“The European Central Bank cut interest rates for the fi rst time in two
years, as Europe is heading into a mild recession. In response the ECB
cuts its key rate to 1.25% from 1.5%, less than four months after it
raised the rate in an effort to battle infl ation.”
CNN Money, November 3, 2011
In a second move, ECB president Mario Draghi cut the benchmark
rates from 1.25% to 1% on December 8, 2011. The rate cut was done to
encourage banks to lend again, during the European debt crisis.
As shown in this report:
“The European Central Bank cut interest rates and announced further
unorthodox measures to boost liquidity but ECB President Mario Draghi
disappointed markets by stopping short of pledging more aggressive
bond buying.”
CNBC, December 8, 2011
EXAMPLE 3.4: RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA CUTS
INTEREST RATES
On November 1, 2011, the Reserve Bank of Australia cut interest rates by 25
basis points from 4.75% to 4.5%, its fi rst cut since April 2009. The move was
done to combat slowing global growth caused by the debt crisis in Europe.
As shown in this report:
“The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has cut interest rates amid
fears of a slowdown in the global economy. The central bank lowered
its key rate to 4.5% from 4.75%, the fi rst cut since April 2009. RBA
said it was concerned about the impact of global economic growth.”

EXAMPLE 3.5: RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA CUTS
INTEREST RATES
On December 6, 2011, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) lowered the
interest rate by another 25 basis points to 4.25%. The biggest reason for
the rate cut was due to China ’s slowing growth.
As shown in this report:
“Australia ’s central bank reduced its benchmark interest rate today
for a second straight month as Europe’ s fi scal crisis threatens to
slow the nation ’s commodity exports, sending the nation’ s currency
lower.”
Bloomberg Businessweek , December 6, 2011
Central Bank Intervention
Central banks sometimes engage in currency interventions to strengthen
or weaken a country ’s currency. (See Examples 3.6 , 3.7 , and 3.8 .)
EXAMPLE 3.6: BANK OF JAPAN INTERVENES
On August 4, 2011, the Bank of Japan sold 4.5 trillion yen to weaken
its currency. Prior to the intervention, investors had fl ocked to the yen
because of its reputation as a safe haven among the G10 currencies. This
caused the currency to strengthen considerably.
Japan is an export-oriented country that thrives on a weak currency.
The yen had risen so much so that it threatened to derail Japan’ s recovery
from the March 11 earthquake and nuclear disaster.
As shown in this report:
“The yen fell against all 16 of its most-traded counterparts after
Japan yesterday sold its currency to stem gains that threaten the
nation ’s economic recovery.”

56 FOREX IS A GAME
EXAMPLE 3.7: BANK OF JAPAN INTERVENES
On October 31, 2011, Japan intervened again. Prior to the intervention,
the yen reached a post-war high of 75.35 against the U.S. dollar as traders
and investors continued to seek refuge from Europe ’s fi scal debt
woes and the United States’ slowdown. During this second intervention,
Japan sold a record 8 trillion yen, causing the yen to plunge more than 4%.
At the time, Finance Minister Jun Azumi said that the move was carried
out to combat one-sided speculative moves that did not refl ect the eco-
nomic fundamentals of the Japanese economy.
As shown in this report:
“The dollar shot up against the yen as Japan stepped in to weaken
its currency after it hit a fresh post-year high against the US. The
dollar stood at 79.18 against 75.82. The move also saw the euro rise
sharply to 111.20 yen from 107.29.”
ChannelnewsAsia, October 31, 2011
EXAMPLE 3.8: SWISS NATIONAL BANK INTERVENES
On September 6, 2011, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) intervened in the
forex market to impose a ceiling on the franc by spending 11 billion
francs to buy euros. This was the fi rst time in more than three decades
that such an action was taken. In a statement, the Zurich-based bank
said that it “will no longer tolerate a EUR/CHF rate below 1.20 and is pre-
pared to buy foreign currency in unlimited quantities.”
At the time, the franc had been steadily gaining against the entire
basket of G8 currencies. In fact, before the intervention, the Swiss franc
had surged more than 13% against the euro in 2011. After the SNB inter-
vened, the Swiss franc immediately weakened, snapping four days of
gains against the euro and causing the EUR/CHF to shoot up like a rocket,
clearing over 1,000 pips in just three hours.
As shown in this report:
“The Swiss National Bank stunned fi nancial markets by setting a ceil-
ing for the Swiss franc against the euro in an attempt to prevent the
strength of its currency from pushing its economy into recession. The
central bank said it would set a minimum exchange rate of SFr1.20
against the euro.”

The Six Major Players 57
Regulate Reserve Requirement Ratio
T he reserve requirement ratio (RRR) is defi ned as the amount of liquid
assets that a central bank mandates a bank to keep at all times. Expressed
as a percentage of the bank’ s total deposits, the RRR ensures that the bank
is able to pay an unusually high number of withdrawals should the need
ever occur. It also helps to ensure that the bank does not overleverage
itself. Increasing or decreasing the RRR has the effect of controlling the
money supply, thereby regulating infl ation.
Increasing the RRR
On May 11, 2011, China announced infl ation fi gures of 5.4% for April 2011.
This was higher than the median estimate of 5.2% that economists were
expecting. A day later, China announced a 50 basis point hike in the RRR,
raising it from 20.5% to 21%. Increasing the RRR essentially limits the sup-
ply of money in the fi nancial system. This has the effect of cooling down
infl ationary pressures.
As shown in this report:
“The People’ s Bank of China just announced another hike in reserve
requirement ratio by 50 basis points. Just as the data published
yesterday invoked divided responses, ranging from rate cut to more
tightening, the PBOC ’s announcement today confirms that they will
continue with its tightening stance.”
Business Insider, May 12, 2011
Decreasing the RRR
On February 18, 2012, China announced a 50 basis point reduction in the
RRR, from 21% to 20.5%. The RRR reduction was estimated to free up
about 350 to 400 billion yuan. The move was done to increase the supply of
money in the fi nancial system, spur lending, and crank up economic activ-
ity in the wake of slowing growth.
As shown in this report:
“China ’s central bank cut the amount of cash that commercial lenders
must hold as reserves on Saturday for the second time in nearly
three months. The PBOC delivered a 50-basis-point cut in banks’
reserve requirement ratio (RRR), after repeatedly defying market
expectations for such a move.”

COMMERCIAL AND INVESTMENT BANKS
Commercial banks are the biggest traders of forex currencies worldwide.
Hooked up to the interbank market, these banks trade currencies with
each other through electronic networks. The spreads, or the difference
between the bid and ask prices, are razor-thin within the interbank market.
T hese narrow spreads allow banks to transact huge amounts of cur-
rencies at very low costs. The top-tier interbank market accounts for about
55% of all forex transactions worldwide. According to the 2012 Euromoney
foreign exchange survey, Deutsche Bank retained its position as the world’ s
largest forex trading bank for the eighth consecutive year.
Other players in the top 10 can be seen in Table 3.1 .
There are basically two reasons why commercial banks participate in
the forex market: to facilitate transactions for clients and to run a propri-
etary trading desk.
Facilitate Transactions for Clients
Banks offer a wide variety of forex services for their clients. These include,
but are not limited to, spot transactions, forwards, options, and interna-
tional money transfers. Their clients include small banks, corporations,
fi nancial institutions, and high-net-worth individuals.
T hese clients engage the currency market in order to hedge currency
risk or to speculate on price movements for profi t. A typical transaction
between the bank and a client follows a simple three-step process:
1. C ontact. This is the fi rst initiation that a client makes with the bank.
The call is usually done through a dedicated direct phone line or

through an electronic dealing platform, such as Reuters Dealing 3000.
The call could be to place an order or simply to request for market
information and seek the salesperson ’s opinion on the direction of the
market.
2. D eal. If there is a need to transact, the client will state the amount
and the currency pair involved. The salesperson on hand then either
quotes the client directly or calls over to the trading desk and obtains
a live price. In general, clients who have an existing relationship with
the bank or who transact larger volumes usually enjoy more competi-
tive pricing than others.
3. E xecute. When the client accepts the quoted price from the bank, the
deal is executed.
By facilitating these transactions for clients, salespeople earn margin
for the bank. The margin is the slack, or the amount in the client ’s quoted
price that a salesperson can alter to benefi t the bank.
Run a Proprietary Trading Desk
B anks run proprietary trading desks for only one reason: to generate
profi t. However, such speculative activities recently have come under fi re
because of the lack of risk management involved. Investment banks such
as Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank are known to generate a large por-
tion of their quarterly and annual profi ts through proprietary trading.
T hese proprietary trading desks are normally kept separate from cus-
tomer fl ow. In 2008, the blowup of the global fi nancial crisis uncovered the
huge risks that banks undertook in their proprietary trading activities.
Bear Stearns, the fi fth largest investment bank in the United States,
was the fi rst big casualty to go under. In March 2008, the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York provided an emergency loan to the bank in
a bid to avert a sudden collapse. However, the losses racked up from its
issuance of asset-backed securities proved to be the death knell for the
company.
I n September 2008, Bear Stearns was sold to JP Morgan Chase
for USD10 per share, a price far below its pre-crisis 52-week high of
USD133.20 per share. The sale, which was higher than the original agreed
upon price of USD2 per share, caused stock holders to lose about 90% of
their investment.
L ehman Brothers, the fourth largest investment bank in the United
States, was the next to follow when it went bankrupt on September 15,
2008. When it fi led for Chapter 11, it had over 26,000 employees and USD639
billion in assets, making it the largest bankruptcy fi ling in the history of the

O n the same day, Merrill Lynch was sold to Bank of America in an all-
stock deal worth USD50 billion. The other top three blowups from propri-
etary trading in recent years are listed next.
1. J erome Kerviel, Société Générale. In 2008, Jerome Kerviel stunned
the entire world by creating the largest loss for a major bank in fi nan-
cial history. In 2000, Kerviel joined the compliance department of
Société Générale, the second largest bank in France. In 2005, he was
promoted to the bank’ s Delta One trading team, which specialized in
the futures markets.
In the course of his trading career, Kerviel made unauthorized trades
worth 30 billion euros, making 1.4 billion euros by the end of the year.
Having cleverly disguised the size of his trade earnings with fake trades,
he started 2008 with an even bigger and, of course, riskier appetite.
W ith his computing skills and inside knowledge, Kerviel managed
to hide 50 billion euros in unauthorized trades. On January 19, 2008,
his employers uncovered his scheme and started winding down posi-
tions over three days beginning January 21.
The losses associated with Kerviel ’s unauthorized trades amounted
to 4.9 billion euros. With the exception of Bernie Madoff’ s Ponzi scheme,
Kerviel’ s losses are considered to be the largest fraud in banking history.
I n May 2010, Kerviel published a book called L ’engrenage: Mémoires
d’un Trader ( Downward Spiral: Memoirs of a Trader ), in which he
alleged that his superiors knew of his trading activities all along.
In October 2012, the Paris appeals court ordered Kerviel to spend
three years in prison and pay back a staggering 4.9 billion euros to his
former employer, Sociéte Genéralé.
2. K weku Adoboli, UBS. In September 2011, Swiss banking giant UBS
announced that it had lost over USD2 billion as a result of the rogue
trading activities by 31-year-old Kweku Adoboli. Adoboli joined UBS
as a trainee in March 2006 and worked his way up to the bank’ s Delta
One trading business, handling exchange-traded funds. When news
of his unauthorized trading activities broke out, UBS’ s shares plum-
meted, wiping off over 3.3 billion euros from the bank ’s market value.
O n September 24, 2011, Oswald Gruebel, then the chief executive
officer (CEO) of UBS, resigned to take responsibility for Adoboli ’s
acts. It was later discovered that UBS had failed to act on a warning
issued by its computer system about Adoboli ’s trading. On January 30,
2012, Adoboli pleaded not guilty to two counts each of fraud and false
accounting. On November 20, 2012, he was found guilty after a 2-month
trial. He was sentenced to 7 years in jail for fraud, and earned the tag of
having caused the largest unauthorized trading loss in British history.

3. B runo Iksil, JP Morgan Chase & Co. In May 2012, JP Morgan Chase
& Co. CEO Jamie Dimon stunned the world when he announced to
investors that bad trades made in London would result in losses of
USD2 billion. The announcement caused the bank ’s share price to
plummet 10% in a day, wiping off USD14 billion of its value. The person
responsible for the huge loss was a French trader name Bruno Iksil,
nicknamed “the London whale” or “Voldermort” after the character in
the Harry Potter books.
A pparently, Iksil had taken bets so large on a credit derivatives
index that the skew (the measure between where the index should be
trading based on its underlying components and where it actually was
trading) got too big for too long. At the time, hedge fund managers
bet against Iksil, and his positions left him deep in the red when the
economic outlook worsened dramatically. In June 2012, CNBC’ s Kate
Kelly reported that JP Morgan Chase & Co. Chief Investment Office
had sold off as much as 65% to 70% of its losing London whale position
in the CDX IG-9 10-year index.
In July 2012, JP Morgan announced that the trading loss amounted
to USD4.4 billion, more than twice the initial estimate. In the same
month, Iksil and two other employees, Achilles Macris and Javier
Martin-Artajo, were taken off the company ’s internal employment
database.
A fter the true amount of the trading loss came to light, Dimon
admitted he was “dead wrong” to dismiss concerns that were raised in
April 2012 about the trades as a tempest in a teapot.
The Volcker Rule
S ince 2008, the repeated unfolding of failed proprietary trading activities
prompted American economist and former U.S. Federal Reserve chairman
Paul Volcker to draw up what is now known as the Volcker Rule. In pro-
posing the rule, Volcker stated that the speculative activities engaged by
the banks, particularly derivatives, played a key role in the global fi nancial
crisis that lasted from 2008 to 2010.
D erivatives initially were designed to mitigate risk in the fi nancial sys-
tem, but their vast usage had produced exactly the opposite effect. Volcker
also argued that Wall Street banks took on excessive risk and engaged in
unfair business practices because regulators were unable to properly moni-
tor the banks’ complex instruments and activities.
Essentially, the Volcker Rule is a specifi c section of the Dodd-Frank
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which restricts U.S.
cc0033..iinndddd 6611 0033//1122//1122 44::3322 PPMM

62 FOREX IS A GAME
banks from trading speculative investments that do not benefi t their
customers.
T he rule states that banks are not allowed to simultaneously enter
into an advisory and creditor role with clients, such as with private equity
fi rms. The Volcker Rule aims to minimize confl icts of interest between
banks and their clients by separating the various types of business prac-
tices fi nancial institutions engage in. It also aims to protect individuals
by creating a more transparent fi nancial framework that can be regulated
more easily.
O n January 21, 2010, President Barack Obama publicly endorsed the
Volcker Rule. A month later, on February 22, fi ve former U.S. Treasury
Secretaries—W. Michael Blumenthal, Nicholas Brady, Paul O’ Neill, George
Shultz, and John Snow—followed suit and endorsed the Volcker Rule by
sending a letter to the W all Street Journal.
T he Volcker Rule is not without its critics. On April 10, 2012, Peter J.
Wallison, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, sent a letter
to the W all Street Journal titled “The Volcker Rule Is Fatally Flawed.” In
the letter, Wallison argued for the repeal of the rule. Here’ s an excerpt from
that letter:
“It ’s not as though proprietary trading of debt securities by banks is
some new idea that sprang from the mind of a Wall Street quant. Bank
regulators, including the Fed when it was headed by Mr. Volcker, have
always permitted banks to buy and sell whole loans, bonds, notes and
commercial paper, as well as securities backed by car loans, credit-
card receivables and mortgages.”

MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS
M ultinational corporations (MNCs) participate in the forex market primar-
ily for hedging purposes. Hedging is basically a type of activity that offsets
the risk associated with currency movements. Hedging represents approxi-
mately 5% of all global forex transactions.
S ome companies even have their own trading fl oors, with traders spec-
ulating in order to make profi ts and to reduce the risks related to exchange
rate fl uctuations. Daily movements in currencies can have a signifi cant
impact on their bottom line.
Examples 3.9 and 3.10 are some real-life examples.

EXAMPLE 3.9: SWISS WATCHMAKER SWATCH GROUP
In July 2011, Swatch CEO Nick Hayek reported that the strength of the
Swiss franc could cost the company upwards of USD 1 billion.
As shown in this report:
Swatch Chief Executive Nick Hayek said: “I think 2011 will be a record
year, but the franc is a real concern.” He added: “If the situation
stays like it is now, sales could be hit by as much as one billion Swiss
francs, or $1.25 billion, due to the impact of the strong franc.”
Wall Street Journal , July 28, 2011
EXAMPLE 3.10: JAPANESE CARMAKER NISSAN
Japan is an export-oriented country, and a strong yen can wipe billions
of dollars off corporate balance sheets in the country. In February 2012,
Nissan reported that for every 1 yen that strengthens against the U.S.
dollar (e.g., if USD/JPY falls from 80 to 79), the company loses 20 billion
yen in annual operating profi t.
As shown in this report:
Chief executive Carlos Ghosn said “the yen ’s recent weakening trend
doesn ’t go far enough. We need more [weakening] to reestablish the
competitiveness of Japan. The dollar should be between ¥90 and
¥100,” adding that he doesn’ t see the yen’ s recent weakening trend
as just a short-term development.
Wall Street Journal, February 27, 2012
Next we look at how hedging is done on the futures market to offset
currency risks.
Hedging Example for Exporters
Let ’s take an example of an export company in Germany (called A), which
has sold a container of materials worth USD100,000 to an import company
in the United States (called B). The deal is done on June 1, 2012, but the
payment is settled only once the goods are delivered on September 1, 2012.
T he risk to Company A is the fl uctuation of the currency rate EUR/USD.
If the euro strengthens against the U.S. dollar between June 1, 2012, and
cc0033..iinndddd 6633 0033//1122//1122 44::3322 PPMM

64 FOREX IS A GAME
September 1, 2012, Company A will receive fewer euros for the USD100,000
paid by Company B, thereby affecting Company A ’s bottom line.
If, however, the euro weakens against the U.S. dollar in the same
period, Company A will receive more euros once the exchange rate is taken
into account. There is no currency risk for Company B because it is based
in the United States and the payment is made in U.S. dollars. Company B
is assured that the amount to pay will always be USD100,000 regardless of
when the payment is made.
T o protect itself against such currency fl uctuations, Company A can
hedge this risk by going “long” on EUR/USD on the futures market. A long
position is a bet that the EUR/USD currency pair will rise. This position
is taken on the day the deal is done, which is June 1, 2012. On September
1, 2012, the day of the cash transaction between the two companies, two
scenarios can happen.
Scenario 1: Euro Strengthens Against the U.S. Dollar Say
the euro strengthens against the U.S. dollar between June 1, 2012, and
September 1, 2012. With a stronger euro, Company A will receive fewer
euros once the USD100,000 is converted to euros. However, it will net a
profi t on the futures market because of its long position.
The lesser cash received for the goods will be offset by the profi t
received on the futures market. This sum total will be almost equivalent to
the sum paid by Company B had the transaction been done on June 1, 2012.
Scenario 2: Euro Weakens Against the U.S. Dollar In contrast,
say the euro weakens against the U.S. dollar between June 1, 2012, and
September 1, 2012. With a weaker euro, Company A will receive more cash
once the USD100,000 is converted to euros. However, it will net a loss on
the futures market because of its long position (which is essentially a bet
that the euro will strengthen against the U.S. dollar).
T he more cash received for the goods will offset the loss incurred on
the futures market. This sum total will be almost equivalent to the sum paid
by Company B had the transaction been done on June 1, 2012.
Let ’s take a look at the next sample transaction.
Futures exchange: Singapore Mercantile Exchange
1 lot 5 € 25,000
1 pip 5 USD2.50
EUR/USD exchange rate on June 1, 2012 5 1.3000
Note: Had the transaction been done on June 1, 2012, the exporter
would have received €76,923 (100,000/1.3000). Hence, the exporter
needs to hedge an amount close to €76,923.
cc0033..iinndddd 6644 0033//1122//1122 44::3322 PPMM

The Six Major Players 65
S ince the contract size for 1 lot on Singapore Mercantile Exchange is
€25,000, the exporter goes long on 3 lots for EUR/USD.
Figure 3.1 shows a hedging example for an exporter.
Because of the hedge, Company A gained certainty of price. If the trans-
action was done on June 1, 2012, the exporter would have received €76,923.
W ith a simple hedge done on the Singapore Mercantile Exchange, the
EUR/USD could have strengthened or weakened 500 pips in three months,
and the amount the exporter received would have been almost identical.
Let ’s have a look at the fi nal summary.
• If goods had been transacted on June 1, 2012, the exporter would have
received €76,923.
• On September 1, 2012, if EUR/USD had strengthened to 1.35, the
exporter would have received €76,852.
• O n September 1, 2012, if EUR/USD had weakened to 1.25, the exporter
would have received €77,000.
T he hedge executed by the exporter provided less than a €100 variance
on either side of the amount of €76,923. This hedge is important to protect
the company ’s bottom line from wild currency fl uctuations.
I f Company A did not enter into a hedge position on the futures
market, it would have received either €74,074 (100,000/1.35) or €80,000
(100,000/1.25). It is this uncertainty that causes exporters to hedge on the
currency market.

I n summary, for exporters, the affected revenue caused by currency
fl uctuations is canceled out by taking a long position in the futures market.
Hedging Example for Importers
Let ’s take an example of an import company in Germany (called A) that
has bought a container of materials worth USD100,000 from an export
company in the United States (called B). The deal is done on June 1, 2012,
but the payment is only settled once the goods are delivered on September
1, 2012.
T he risk to Company A is the fl uctuation of the currency rate EUR/
USD. If the euro weakens against the U.S. dollar between June 1, 2012,
and September 1, 2012, Company A will have to pay more euros for the
USD100,000 due to Company B, thereby affecting its bottom line.
If the euro strengthens against the U.S. dollar in the same period,
Company A will pay fewer euros for the USD100,000 once the exchange
rate is taken into account.
T here is no currency risk for Company B because it is based in the
United States and the incoming payment is made in U.S. dollars. It has
the assurance that the amount it receives from Company A will always be
USD100,000 regardless of when the payment is made.
T o protect itself against currency fl uctuations, Company A can hedge
this risk by going short on EUR/USD on the futures market. A short posi-
tion is a bet that the EUR/USD currency pair will drop.
T his position is taken on the day the deal is done, which is June 1, 2012.
On September 1, 2012, which is the day of the cash transaction between the
two companies, two scenarios can happen.
Scenario 1: Euro Strengthens Against the U.S. Dollar Say
the euro strengthens against the U.S. dollar between June 1, 2012, and
September 1, 2012. With a stronger euro, Company A will pay fewer euros
once the USD100,000 is converted to euros. However, it will incur a loss on
the futures market because of its short position.
T he lower payment for the goods will be countered by the loss incurred
on the futures market. This sum total will be almost equivalent to the sum
paid to Company B had the transaction been done on June 1, 2012.
Scenario 2: Euro Weakens Against the U.S. Dollar In contrast,
say the euro weakens against the U.S. dollar between June 1, 2012, and
September 1, 2012. With a weaker euro, Company A will pay more euros
for the USD100,000 bill due to Company B. However, it will net a profi t on
the futures market because of its short position.

The more euros paid out is countered by the profi t gained on the
short position in the futures market. This sum total will be almost equiva-
lent to the sum paid to Company B had the transaction been done on June
1, 2012.
Let ’s take a look at the next sample transaction.
Futures exchange: Singapore Mercantile Exchange
1 lot 5 $ 25 , 000
1 pip 5 USD2.50
EUR/USD exchange rate on June 1, 2012 5 1.3000
Note: Had the transaction been done on June 1, 2012, the importer
would have paid €76,923 (100,000/1.3000). Hence, the importer needs to
hedge an amount close to €76,923.
S ince the contract size for one lot on Singapore Mercantile Exchange
is €25,000, the importer goes short on 3 lots for EUR/USD.
Figure 3.2 shows a hedging example for an importer.
B ecause of the hedge, Company A gained certainty of price. If the
transaction was done on June 1, 2012, the importer would have paid
€76,923.
W ith a simple hedge done on the Singapore Mercantile Exchange, the
EUR/USD could have strengthened or weakened 500 pips in three months
and the amount the importer paid would have been almost identical.

Let ’s have a look at the fi nal summary:
• I f goods had been transacted on June 1, 2012, the importer would have
paid €76,923.
• On September 1, 2012, if EUR/USD had strengthened to 1.35, the
importer would have paid € 76,852.
• O n September 1, 2012, if EUR/USD had weakened to 1.25, the importer
would have paid €77,000.
The hedge executed by the importer provided less than a €100 variance
on either side of the amount of €76,923. This hedge is important to protect
the company ’s bottom line from wild currency fl uctuations.
I f Company A did not enter into a hedge position on the futures market,
it would have paid either €74,074 (100,000/1.35) or €80,000 (100,000/1.25). It
is this uncertainty that causes importers to hedge on the currency market.
In summary, for importers, the cost of goods caused by currency fl uc-
tuations is canceled out by taking a short position in the futures market.
INSTITUTIONAL TRADERS
I nstitutional investors in the forex market include investment and insur-
ance companies, pension funds, endowment funds, mutual funds, and
hedge funds. These institutions make up about 30% of all forex transac-
tions worldwide.
A s international players on the fi nancial circuit, these institutions par-
ticipate in the forex market for two reasons. The fi rst reason is to trade for
profi t. The second reason is that with a global portfolio spanning several
countries, fl uctuations in the forex market require the investment manag-
ers to hedge their portfolios against currency risks.
An example of a modern-day hedge fund is FX Concepts, the world ’s
largest currency hedge fund, which manages over USD12 billion in assets
(as of 2012). In early 2011, chairman and chief investment offi cer John
Taylor announced that its Global Currency Program earned 12.53% in 2010,
topping the Barclay Hedge Fund Index by 2 percentage points.
A segment of the institutional crowd that has gained rapid popularity
in recent years is called high-frequency trading (HFT). Sometimes referred
to as algorithmic trading, HFT aims to earn small, short-term profi ts on a
high number of trades.
I nstitutional-level HFT is rarely conducted over the public Internet,
due to latency issues. It generally is outsourced to an institutional-grade
cc0033..iinndddd 6688 0033//1122//1122 44::3322 PPMM

The Six Major Players 69
data center. Due to the extreme necessity for speed in the execution of
trades, most principals seek to co-locate their transaction servers at dis-
tances measured in yards of their liquidity provider’ s servers. Milliseconds
can mean the difference between success and failure in HFT.
RETAIL FOREX BROKERS
Brokers allow individuals to access the forex market by passing clients’
orders to commercial banks or institutional trading platforms, such as
EBS, Reuters Dealing, and HotSpot. There are two basic models of bro-
kers: straight-through processing (STP) or market making (MM). STP
brokers pass the entire fl ow of their clients’ orders straight through to the
liquidity providers behind them. These brokers get paid from the spread
or by charging a commission on each transaction. MM brokers operate
differently. Besides earning a spread or commission on each transaction,
MM brokers book clients’ trades in house, which means that the brokers
themselves become the counterparties to client trades.
On October 31, 2011, one of the world ’s largest derivatives brokers, MF
Global, went under, becoming the seventh largest bankruptcy in U.S. his-
tory. Besides embracing a market-making model, what sealed MF Global’ s
fate was a USD6.3 billion bet on the bonds of some of Europe’ s most
indebted nations.
As shown in this report:
“MF Global filed for bankruptcy on Monday morning in New York,
after the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as well as the major
exchanges suspended dealings with the broker-dealer led by Jon
Corzine. This followed its suspension as a primary dealer by the
New York Fed, as well as the suspension on trading by MF Global on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, ICE and NYSE Life, which said
MF Global clients were limited to liquidation-only trading.”
Financial Services, October 31, 2011
The market-making model of brokers carries huge risks. Profi ts can
soar when trades go their way, but things can turn sour very quickly when
trades go horribly wrong. The STP model, in contrast, is a steady business
model with no downside risk. Unlike the market-making model, profi ts are
not volatile because the broker itself does not act as the counterparty to
the client’ s trades. Profi ts are made solely on the volume of trades executed
by the clients.

S ome of the world’ s largest retail forex brokers include FXCM, Oanda,
Alpari, GFT, and FXPRIMUS.
RETAIL TRADERS
By all accounts, retail traders represent the fastest-growing segment of the
entire forex market. One of the key factors for the explosive growth in
recent years was the crash of 2008.
O n September 29, 2008, the Dow Jones fell a jaw-dropping 778 points
in a single day, closing at 10365. From October 2008 to March 2009, the
Dow continued to shed 40% of its value. The global fi nancial crisis caused
decade-old institutions to go out of business, and many families saw their
hard-earned wealth evaporate.
The fi nancial crisis also triggered a massive wave of deleveraging that
saw investors fl ock to the safety of the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, and Swiss
franc. As investors in other asset classes were reeling from the crisis, trad-
ers in the forex market remained largely unscathed. One of the key ele-
ments that kept the heads of forex traders above water was the ability to
go long or short at any time.
T his was, and continues to be, the very reason that draws thousands
of people into the forex market daily. Today, retail forex traders account
for about 8% of the total forex market—and still growing. According to a
recent report by Forex Magnates on February 1, 2012, the retail forex mar-
ket volume is USD217 billion daily and USD4,777 billion monthly.
SUMMARY
There are six main participants in the forex market: central banks,
commercial banks and investment banks, multinational corporations,
institutional traders, retail forex brokers, and retail traders.
Central banks take part in the forex market to stabilize their respec-
tive economies. They do this in three main ways: regulating interest rates,
regulating reserve requirement ratios, and direct intervention by buying or
selling currencies.
C ommercial banks take part in the forex market for two reasons: to
facilitate forex transactions for their clients and to speculate for profi t.
Banks speculate by running their own proprietary trading desks. However,
inherent risks exist when they do this. Some of the biggest trading blowups
cc0033..iinndddd 7700 0033//1122//1122 44::3322 PPMM

The Six Major Players 71
in history occurred because bank traders were left unchecked when they
took on too much risk by piling on one trading position after another.
T hree of the most notable rogue traders in history are Jerome Kerviel
of Société Générale, Kweku Adoboli of UBS, and Bruno Iksil of JPMorgan
Chase & Co. Through their rouge trading activities, these three men racked
up collective losses exceeding USD10 billion.
The repeated unfolding of such failed proprietary trading activities
prompted American economist and former United States Federal Reserve
chairman Paul Volcker to draw up the Volcker Rule, which is a specifi c sec-
tion of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
that restricts U.S. banks from trading speculative investments that do not
benefi t their customers.
Multinational corporations take part in the forex market primarily for
hedging purposes. A hedge is basically a type of activity that offsets the
risk associated with currency movements. Hedging is mostly done when
companies receive money or pay for goods in currencies other than their
own local currency.
E xporters take out long positions on their currency because the risk of
a stronger currency erodes their net profi t when payment is made in other
currencies. Importers take out short positions on their currency because
the risk of a weaker currency means they have to pay more for goods that
are denominated in other currencies. With a simple hedge, corporations
gain certainty of price. Doing this keeps their bottom line fairly predictable
regardless of how the currency market moves.
Institutional traders, forex brokers, and retail traders all trade the
forex market for the same reason: to generate profi ts. A segment of
the institutional crowd that has gained rapid popularity in recent years is
called high-frequency trading (HFT). Sometimes referred to as algorith-
mic trading, HFT aims to earn small, short-term profi ts on a high number
of trades.
A s a result of increasing demand from the retail crowd, transaction
costs have decreased, technology offerings have improved, and value-
added services on forex brokerage fi rms have increased tremendously over
the years.

CHAPTER 4
Why You Must Play
the Game
T
here are many reasons why retail traders are jumping on the forex
bandwagon at an accelerated pace. This chapter lists the top 17
advantages. One of the biggest attractions lies in the market’ s unpar-
alleled liquidity. The forex market is the largest market in the world and is
open 24 hours a day, 5 days a week. Traders can also go short at any time
and take advantage of the massive leverage available, sometimes as high
as 500:1.
B rokers provide other advantages. Some of these advantages include
free tools, quality resources, free practice accounts, and the beauty of start-
ing live trading with a low capital outlay. This chapter also discusses the
biggest advantage in trading the forex market: It gives you a fi rm grip on
global fi nance and other asset classes because it deals with the lowest com-
mon denominator in every country: the currency.
TOP 17 REASONS TO TRADE FOREX
T here are a myriad of reasons to explain why ordinary folks and fellow
traders are jumping on board the forex market at an accelerated pace.
Here we discuss 17 of these reasons.
1. Global 24-Hour Market
One of the biggest draws of the forex market is its 24-hour accessibility,
Mondays to Fridays. This accessibility is possible because markets around
the world open and close at different times to facilitate cross-border global
73
cc0044..iinndddd 7733 0066//1122//1122 22::2244 PPMM

trade. Trading starts in Sydney, Australia, on Monday morning, and as the
day goes on, more fi nancial markets open for business: Japan, Singapore,
and other parts of Asia. The Middle East, Europe, and fi nally the Americas
follow.
When the U.S. market starts to close, Australia begins again, and the
process goes on 24 hours a day until the markets close at 5 p.m. New York
time on Friday. Today, at any point of time, there is always a major fi nan-
cial center open where commercial banks, hedge funds, corporations, and
retail traders engage in trading currencies.
T he 24-hour availability means that traders can trade virtually any time
of the day, without waiting for markets to open. This accessibility is par-
ticularly helpful to people who hold a day job. In contrast, the stock or
futures market is opened for about eight hours a day only.
T he next table shows the opening and closing times of the top three
fi nancial markets in the world: London, New York, and Tokyo.
Forex Market Greenwich Mean Time
Tokyo open 23:00
Tokyo close 08:00
London open 07:00
London close 16:00
New York open 12:00
New York close 21:00
2. World ’s Most Liquid Market
The forex market today is undisputedly the largest fi nancial market
in the world. According to the 2010 Triennial Survey from the Bank for
International Settlements, the offi cial forex daily turnover was already
USD4.0 trillion.
With such an immense amount of money in the fi nancial system, there
are always ready buyers and sellers to transact any amount at any price,
especially the currencies of the major economies. Traders never have to
worry about the inability to exit a trade once they enter.
Other asset classes, such as stocks, futures, options, and commodities,
do not enjoy such massive liquidity. In fact, their illiquidity tends to restrict
traders, especially during after hours.
The most liquid hours of the trading cycle occur when two major fi nan-
cial centers are open, such as during the period of Asia closing/Europe
opening and Europe closing/U.S. opening.
cc0044..iinndddd 7744 0066//1122//1122 22::2244 PPMM

Why You Must Play the Game 75
3. Limited Slippage
“ Slippage” is defi ned as the difference between the expected price of a trade
and the price the trade actually executes at. However, due to the market ’s
liquidity, slippage is almost a non-issue as most brokers honor instantaneous
trade executions from real-time quotes that are displayed on the traders’
screens. Slippage is inversely proportional to the volume available at each
price level—the more volume there is, the less slippage a trader experiences.
D uring normal market conditions, there is usually no slippage. The
only time slippage becomes an issue is when economic news is released.
Such times lead to higher volatility than usual, and slippage may occur
when markets move too fast.
When slippage does occur, a trader ends up paying more than the
quoted spread. As an example, if the quoted spread for the EUR/USD is 2
pips and the trader gets slipped an additional 2 pips, the entire cost for the
transaction becomes 4 pips.
4. Go Short Anytime
I n the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
introduced a rule that disallowed selling short in the equity market, except
on an uptick. This rule limits traders who are able to spot opportunities in
the market when prices fall fast.
S uch restrictions are not confi ned to the equity market. In the futures
market, a limit-down/limit-up rule prevents prices from moving beyond a
certain percentage from the previous day ’s settlement price. However, no
such rules apply in the forex market. You can short a currency pair as much
as you want at any time, without needing to wait for any upticks.
The main reason forex traders can go short at any time is because forex
is traded in currency pairs. This means that in every currency transaction,
there will always be one currency that gains over another.
A s an example, when you go short on USD/CAD, you are in fact selling
U.S. dollars and buying Canadian dollars. When you go long on USD/CAD,
you are in fact buying U.S. dollars and selling Canadian dollars.
Depending on how the market moves, one currency will always be los-
ing value over the other. It is for this reason that forex traders are able to
go short at any time.
5. No Restrictions
T he forex market is considered an over-the-counter (OTC) market, where
trading is done via an interbank network. OTC trading is the opposite of
exchange trading, which occurs on futures exchanges or stock exchanges.
cc0044..iinndddd 7755 0066//1122//1122 22::2244 PPMM

76 FOREX IS A GAME
When trading is done on an exchange, rules apply. Here ’s an example:
O n August 12, 2011, four European countries—Italy, France, Spain, and
Belgium—banned the short selling of stock in their markets to try to halt
the precipitous plunge in value of troubled European banks. The move was
similar to the decision made by the SEC when it banned the shorting of
stocks in the United States during the 2008 fi nancial crisis.
Such exchange-enforced rules do not apply to the forex market simply
because, as an OTC market, forex is not traded on any exchange, and thus
it is not governed by the rules of any exchange.
6. High Leverage
The forex market offers the highest leverage available for any fi nancial
instrument. Today, brokers offer leverage as high as 500:1. This means that
traders can control $100,000 worth of currencies with only $200. Traders
also have the fl exibility to select the right amount of leverage to suit their
style of trading.
Leverage is essential for retail traders to make good money from forex
trading. This is because the average daily percentage move of a major cur-
rency is less than 1%, whereas a stock can easily have a 10% price move
on any given day. With decent leverage, you do not need to fork out a huge
amount to trade one standard lot.
Comparatively, high leverage is not available in the equity market. This
means that equity traders have to fork out more margin to trade. Leverage
is further reduced when the trader decides to short. Again, these restric-
tions do not exist in the forex market.
7. Low Cost
When you trade the forex market, the only transaction cost you pay is the
spread. As discussed in Chapter 2 , the spread is the difference between
the buy price and the sell price, and it is the only fee charged by the broker
for executing your trade.
I n comparison, when equity traders execute a trade, both spread
and commission are incurred as fees. Due to the intense competition
from thousands of brokers worldwide, spreads have dropped dramati-
cally in the last few years. That is good news for retail traders like you
and me.
T oday, most brokers offer a spread of only 2 to 3 pips on the EUR/USD,
the most widely traded currency pair in the forex market.
Figure 4.1 shows a 2 pip spread for EUR/USD on FXPRIMUS.

8. Absolute Convenience
A s an OTC market, the forex market has no physical location; all trading is
done electronically. All you need is an Internet connection and your favor-
ite device and you can execute a trade anywhere in the world.
W ith the explosion of technology, almost everyone is connected to
the Internet, and brokers have made it easy to access their platform via
laptops, mobile phones, iPhones, iPads, and BlackBerrys.
I know many forex traders who travel the world while staying con-
nected to their business of making money online. This freedom is truly
something which the forex market can offer to anyone.
9. Practice Accounts
E very good broker offers a free practice or demo account. The practice
account means two things: You trade with virtual money but you see live
prices. Practice accounts allow new traders to get a taste of the forex mar-
ket before jumping in with real funds.
Practice accounts are useful because they help both new and advanced
traders alike. For new traders, practice accounts help them to build
confi dence and familiarity. For advanced traders, practice accounts help
them to refi ne or test new strategies before using those exact systems to
trade live.

10. Market Transparency
Whenever governments, central bank chiefs, or fi nance ministers make
economic/monetary policies that affect currencies, the announcements
are readily available on almost every media imaginable within a few min-
utes. The bonus is that in most cases, warning signals or hints about future
actions are dropped in advance. Here ’s an example:
O n August 4, 2011, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) sold 4.5 trillion yen
to weaken its currency. This caused the USD/JPY to shoot up 300 pips in
one day.
O n October 31, 2011, Japan intervened again, selling a record 8 trillion
yen. This move caused the yen to plunge more than 4% and caused the
USD/JPY to shoot up over 350 pips in just three hours.
T he fact of the matter is this: Prior to the interventions, BOJ gov-
ernor Masaaki Shirakawa and the two fi nance ministers who were in
charge at the time—Yoshihiko Noda on August 4 and Jun Azumi on
October 31, 2011—had been preparing the markets for the move weeks
before they acted.
T hey had dropped strong hints of an upcoming intervention to combat
one-sided speculative trades on the Japanese yen. The reason why they
were so transparent with their intentions was to signal the traders to stand
on the same side as them and collectively go long on USD/JPY.
cc0044..iinndddd 7788 0066//1122//1122 22::2244 PPMM

Why You Must Play the Game 79
When traders participate in a coordinated action, chances of a sustain-
able rally become higher, and the central bank does not have to spend as
much money to weaken the yen.
M arket transparency in stocks or commodities, however, is a lot lower.
For example, no large institution will signal its intention to acquire a stock
at a certain price. If word gets out and traders take part in a similar coordi-
nated action and start bidding up the stock price, the stock would become
more expensive for the institution to acquire.
As shown in this report:
“Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said that the yen is “strongly
overvalued” and made it clear he has been in touch with overseas
authorities on currency matters, fueling speculation the government
may act to stem the yen ’s steady rise.”
Wall Street Journal , August 2, 2011
11. No One Can Corner the Market
Due to its sheer size, no single entity, not even a central bank, can control
the market price for an extended period. Take a look at Figure 4.3 , which
shows the intervention by the BoJ on August 4, 2011. Within four days,
the price of USD/JPY had fl oated back down to the pre-intervention price.

This is one of the main reasons why central banks are becoming less and
less inclined to intervene and manipulate market prices.

12. Tools and Resources
Most forex brokers today provide a plethora of resources for traders to
access. These include breaking news, trade alerts, live webinars, vid-
eos, and tutorials just to name a few. Traders today have a wide range of
resources to get them up to speed to trade profi tably.
I n my experience, to be consistently profi table in the forex market,
you need:
1. T he ability to decode breaking news
2. T he skill to execute live trades
3. T he mentorship of a coach
Some brokers offer resources that fulfi ll part or all three of these
requirements. This is great news for new and experienced traders alike
because getting a world-class education enables you to achieve consistent
profi ts in the forex market.
cc0044..iinndddd 8800 0066//1122//1122 22::2244 PPMM

Why You Must Play the Game 81
A dditionally, some brokers offer the ability to trade several asset
classes all on the same platform. As you mature as a trader, it is only natu-
ral that you become more aware of capital fl ows and how they move into
gold, oil, and commodities. You will appreciate the convenience of monitor-
ing several markets all on one platform provided by the broker.
13. No Middlemen
Y ou don’ t have to pick up a phone to tell someone on the other end
to execute or close a trade for you. Although you are trading through
your broker ’s platform, you are in total control of the transaction the
entire time.
Y ou decide when you would like to go long on the GBP/USD or short
on the NZD/USD. You have full control and autonomy over your account,
which puts you in the driver ’s seat to achieve consistent profi ts in the
forex market.
14. Low Start-up Cost
One of the biggest advantages of getting started in forex trading is the low
barrier to entry. Ten years ago, it was rare for someone to open a forex
trading account for under USD100,000. However, with the explosion of
forex brokers all over the world, you no longer have to lay out a lot of cash
when you start trading live. Today, some brokers offer you the opportunity
to open a real account with as little as USD100. Additionally, you won ’t
incur any setup fees, monthly payments, or software rental fees.
The brokers provide the trading software for free, and it comes with
the practice account that we discussed earlier. Most forex brokers world-
wide use the Meta Trader 4 platform, which is the most popular trading
software loved by traders all around the world.
15. Global Finance Decoded
I speak from personal experience when I say that I could never really
understand global fi nance until the day I started trading forex. As a trader,
understanding market sentiment is key and knowing when risk is on or off
helps me tremendously in my trading decisions.
Let ’s take a look at an example. When you trade forex, you will be
privy to the interest rates attached to each currency. Generally the curren-
cies with higher interest rates are categorized as the risk currencies while
those with lower interest rates are termed the safe haven currencies.
cc0044..iinndddd 8811 0066//1122//1122 22::2244 PPMM

82 FOREX IS A GAME
When risk appetite is strong in the markets, currencies with low
interest rates—the low yielders—will be sold off in preference for the
risk currencies, which give a better return. This trade is commonly
known as the carry trade.
Conversely, when risk is off, the opposite effect happens. Risk cur-
rencies are sold off, and money moves back to the low yielders. The
distinction is subtle but important: Currencies with high interest rates
do not climb all the time.
I n times of fear and panic, risk is off and traders are more concerned
with parking their money in a safe place as opposed to earning a higher
return. Trading the forex market helps you to decode such sentiment.
16. Recession-Proof Income
One of my earliest mentors told me an important money lesson that I ’ll
never forget: “Mario, if you want to be rich, you ’ve got to get yourself on a
platform that is recession-proof.” Knowing what I know now, I believe that
trading the forex market is the best recession-proof platform to generate
consistent income.
W hy is this true? There is always an opportunity to go long or short.
There is always an opportunity to make money. Forex traders are never
affected by recessions, market cycles, or downturns.
17. All for One, and One Forex
This last point is the most important. It also takes slightly longer to explain.
Trading the forex market gives you insights into other fi nancial markets,
such as stocks, oil, gold, commodities, and fi xed income securities like
bonds.
When you trade currencies, you are trading a unit of a country. This
gives you the ability to see global capital fl ows.
Stocks Here ’s an example of how forex helps in trading the stock
market. Let’ s take an example of a trader who is based in Singapore but
decides to buy shares in global giant Apple, which is based in the United
States.
To do this, the trader needs to exchange Singapore dollars (SGD) to
U.S. dollars before using U.S. dollars to buy the Apple stock. In this regard,
the trader is already exposed to the forex market through the USD/SGD
exchange rate.
Fast forward three months. Our trader makes a 20% gain from the Apple
stock. To realize the profi t, the trader sells off the shares and converts the
cc0044..iinndddd 8822 0066//1122//1122 22::2244 PPMM

Why You Must Play the Game 83
U.S. dollars back into Singapore dollars. However, during the three months,
the Singapore dollar actually strengthened against the U.S. dollar.
Although our trader made 20% gains from Apple stock, the stronger
Singapore dollar would have eroded a portion of his cash. Knowledge of
the forex market could have induced the trader to take a short position
on the USD/SGD currency pair so that he would not be susceptible to the
wild swings of the USD/SGD exchange rate.
Commodities T hree factors affect the price of commodities worldwide:
1. D emand and supply
2. V alue of the U.S. dollar
3. S peculation on the futures market
The U.S. dollar is used in vast amounts in international trade, and
almost all global commodities are priced in U.S. dollars. Hence, under-
standing its role in the commodities arena is key. In general, the price of
commodities is inversely proportional to the value of the U.S. dollar. This
means that when the value of the U.S. dollar goes down, the price of com-
modities tend to rise.
T here are two reasons for this. First, a weak dollar makes U.S. exports
cheaper for foreign countries, which boosts sales of commodities, such as
corn, wheat, and soybeans, and causes their prices to rise.
Understanding the nature of the U.S. dollar as a safe haven and a
reserve currency helps us with the second reason—when risk is on, fund
managers move money out of safe haven assets and into risk assets. This
causes the U.S. dollar to be sold off (causing it to fall in value) in favor of
risk assets, such as commodities. When speculation on commodities is rife
in the futures market, price tends to rise.
We discuss strategies for other commodities in Chapter 8 .
Bonds T he key driver of bond prices is the prevailing interest rate in the
country. Trading the forex market helps keep us abreast of the interest rate
environment because it ’s one of the drivers of currency fl ows.
It also helps us to be ahead of the curve. Here ’s an example:
I n Chapter 2, we discussed how high infl ation normally brings about
expectations for higher interest rates. Forex traders are among the fi rst
to take advantage of any impending rate hikes because rate hikes tend to
strengthen the currency, and forex traders do not want to miss out on the
chance to go long.
Once interest rates are hiked, the natural path is for bond prices to
drop. Armed with this information ahead of time, forex traders can make
cc0044..iinndddd 8833 0066//1122//1122 22::2244 PPMM

84 FOREX IS A GAME
calculated decisions on the benefi ts of owning a cheaper bond when
prices drop. This is how forex trading helps with the buying and selling
of bonds.
SUMMARY
With a daily trading volume in excess of USD4 trillion, the forex market
offers unparalleled advantages. Due to the sheer size of the forex mar-
ket, its immense liquidity offers three advantages:
1. B uyers and sellers are able to execute any order size at any price.
2. S lippage is drastically reduced.
3. H ardly any insider trading occurs. The same cannot be said with other
asset classes, such as equities or commodities.
Another important aspect of the forex market is that it is the only fi nan-
cial market in the world that is open 24 hours a day, fi ve days a week.
International trade takes place continuously between countries, and the
ability to buy and sell currencies must be available.
As quotes are given in currency pairs, traders have the ability to go
long or short at any time, with absolutely no restrictions on going short.
Considered an OTC market, the forex market also enjoys the privilege of
not falling under the jurisdiction of any fi nancial exchange.
When instruments are traded on an exchange, rules and regulations of
both the country and the exchange apply. This sometimes can be more of a
hindrance than a help to retail traders.
High leverage is also another advantage when trading the forex market.
Leverage is provided by brokers. The higher the leverage employed, the
less margin needed to control one standard lot of currencies.
T o date, the leverage available on the forex market far outweighs
the leverage available on either the equities or the futures market. Other
benefi ts that brokers provide include low transaction costs, low account
start-ups, free practice accounts, and free tools and resources. As the retail
forex brokerage space becomes more and more competitive, brokers start
to compete with one another to offer the best products and services to
retail traders.
All this is good news for traders, who now have a wide array of choices
to consider when starting on a forex journey.
Today, the forex market continues to attract retail traders all over the
world at an unprecedented pace for three reasons:
cc0044..iinndddd 8844 0066//1122//1122 22::2244 PPMM

Why You Must Play the Game 85
1. T he ability to go long and short anytime means that the forex market is
practically a recession-proof vehicle.
2. T raders can access the forex market with just an Internet connection
and an electronic device (e.g., laptop, tablet, or mobile phone).
3. M ost important, forex trading gives traders an in-depth understand-
ing of other asset classes, such as equities, bonds, and commodities
because currencies are truly the lowest common denominator in any
country. An understanding of forex gives traders a huge advantage in
decoding global fi nance and capital fl ows.

CHAPTER 5
Play It Your Way
Understanding Your Profile
T
his chapter provides insight into the fi ve different categories of forex
traders: scalpers, day traders, swing traders, position traders, and
mechanical traders. After reading it, you will understand the differ-
ences among the fi ve and the three advantages of each category. This chap-
ter also includes a test to help you determine which category you belong
to. Once you discover your category, you will learn how your personality
can help or affect your trading.
I have had the privilege to speak to large audiences all over the world.
The most common question thrown at me is “Should I buy now or sell
now?” Each time I hear the question, I can ’t help but smile. After all, that
was my biggest question when I fi rst started trading forex. “Tell me what to
do now, and we ’ll talk about trading later!”
M y answer, as always, goes like this: “You can buy now if your trading
strategy tells you to buy now. You can also sell now if your trading strategy
tells you to do so.”
This answer always draws one of two responses: confused looks or
exasperated ones.
However, the answer is precisely that—you can buy or sell at anytime.
Let ’s see why.
A s shown in Figure 5 .1, Trader A goes long at Point X and exits at
Point Y. Simultaneously, Trader B goes short at Point X but exits at Point Z.
In both cases, each trader ended up with a profi t.
I n each case, both traders entered at exactly the same time and price.
The only reason why both traders ended up making a profi t is because
they had different exit prices. This example also tells us that both traders
executed their trades using different strategies.
Y ou see, one of the key elements of successful trading is having a
specifi c strategy that tells you what to do. Human beings are emotional

creatures. This is the reason why fear, greed, and hope are antithetical to
successful trading.
When you follow a concise strategy, nothing is left to emotional
triggers and everything boils down to following the rules of the strategy. The
sentence “When you fail to plan, you plan to fail” rings true in the trading
world as well as in life.
H owever, over the years as a trader and coach, I unearthed a disturbing
pattern that seemed to permeate the global trading community: Even with a
successful trading strategy, traders still seemed to suffer consistent losses
rather than consistent profi ts.
THE EXPERIMENT
This fi nding led me to conduct an experiment at my forex academy. The
experiment involved two traders whom I shall call Mike and Amanda.
The test was simple. All Mike and Amanda had to do was to follow the
trading plan I gave them. The trading plan consisted of a trading strategy,
complete with specifi c rules on how to enter for a long trade and how to
enter for a short trade.
We even spent two days together to ensure that they fully understood
the rules of the trading plan. In fact, to ensure that I left no stone unturned,
cc0055..iinndddd 8888 0033//1122//1122 99::5555 AAMM

Play It Your Way 89
I sent both traders alerts via their mobile phones to watch for any
upcoming trade setup.
A t the end of one month, their results were very different. Mike ended
up having a net return of 10% for his account; Amanda managed a return
of only 2%. This result was all the more interesting considering that both
Mike and Amanda:
1. S tarted with the same capital
2. T ook exactly the same number of trades
3. E ntered all the trades correctly
4. F aithfully called me after they entered every trade
How could this be?
After an in-depth study on their trades, I found that the biggest reason
for the difference in their accounts was that Amanda constantly meddled
with her trades. Although she executed the entries perfectly, she messed
up the exits. A common and truthful statement she shared with me was
“I was too impatient to wait for the trade to exit so I got out earlier.”
M ike, however, had no problems following through on trades after
he entered them. Essentially, he did not meddle with his trades after he
entered them but allowed them to hit either their stops or their targets.
In short, although both traders had the same strategy, Amanda ’s per-
sonality caused her to exit some trades prematurely. Those actions caused
her account to have a different result from Mike ’s, although both had access
to the same resources and the same trading strategy.
The result of that experiment became the driving force to write this
book. The message is simple: Having a successful strategy is only the
fi rst step. Pairing a successful strategy with your personality is far more
important.
I n essence, there is no perfect strategy. The perfect strategy is the one
that perfectly suits you.
Sports Illustrated
Let ’s look at an example in sports. If I were a sports coach and a budding
athlete came up to me and asked, “Hey, coach, which sport should I play so
that I can achieve mega success in the sporting world?”
As a coach, I would consider fi ve options. Option 1 could be baseball.
One of its greats, Babe Ruth, has been named the greatest baseball
player of all time in various surveys and rankings. In 1998, the Sporting
News ranked him number one on the list of “Baseball’ s 100 Greatest
cc0055..iinndddd 8899 0033//1122//1122 99::5555 AAMM

90 FOREX IS A GAME
Players.” In 1969, he was named baseball ’s Greatest Player Ever in a bal-
lot commemorating the hundredth anniversary of professional baseball.
In 1993, the Associated Press reported that Muhammad Ali was tied with
Babe Ruth as the most recognized athlete in America.
I n his career, Ruth had an eye-popping batting average of 0.342 en route
to winning the World Series seven times.
Option 2 could be soccer. One of its greats, Lionel Messi, has numer-
ous accolades. In 2010, France Football ranked him at the top of its list of
the world’ s richest soccer players, ahead of David Beckham and Cristiano
Ronaldo, with £29.6 million in combined income from salaries, bonuses,
and off-fi eld earnings.
In 2011, Messi won the prestigious Fifa Ballon d ’Or, making him the
fi rst player in the world to win three straight Fifa world player trophies.
In 2012, Messi made Union of European Football Associations (UEFA)
Champions League history by becoming the fi rst player to score fi ve goals
in one match.
The third option could be motor racing. The offi cial Formula 1 website
states that Michael Schumacher is “statistically the greatest driver the sport
has ever seen.” He holds many of the sport ’s records, including race victo-
ries, fastest laps, pole positions, points scored, and most races won in a
single season—13 in 2004.
In 2002, he became the only driver in Formula 1 history to fi nish in
the top three in every race of a season and then also broke the record for
most consecutive podium fi nishes. To date, he is the sport’ s only 7-time
world champion.
Option 4 could be track and fi eld. Usain Bolt is a Jamaican sprinter
who has netted fi ve gold medals in two World Championships and six gold
medals in two Olympics. At the time of this writing, he is the world record
and Olympic record holder in the 100 meters, the 200 meters, and (along
with his teammates) the 4×100 meter relay. He is also the reigning Olympic
champion in these three events.
In 2009, Bolt stunned the world in Berlin with a record-breaking effort
in the 100 meter fi nal, fi nishing in an astonishing 9.58 seconds.
The fi fth and fi nal option could be boxing. Manny Pacquiao is boxing ’s
fi rst 8-division world champion, having won six world titles. He is also
the fi rst fi ghter to win the lineal championship in four different weight
classes. He was named “Fighter of the Decade” for the 2000s by the Boxing
Writers Association of America (BWAA). He is also a 3-time “The Ring”
and BWAA “Fighter of the Year,” winning the award in 2006, 2008 and 2009.
Today, Pacquiao is rated as the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world.
I n all fi ve of these examples, the athletes would be considered extremely
successful in their chosen sporting fi eld. Some even feature regularly in the
cc0055..iinndddd 9900 0033//1122//1122 99::5555 AAMM

Play It Your Way 91
annual F orbes list of the world ’s highest-paid athletes, earning millions of
dollars from salaries, bonuses, and sponsorships. However, pointing young
athletes a certain way just because others have been successful in that fi eld
may not yield similar results.
I n fact, it would be hard to even imagine soccer great Lionel Messi
having the same level of boxing success as Manny Pacquiao, should he
decide on a career switch one day.
Recently, global TV giant Entertainment and Sports Programming
Network (ESPN) came up with a list of ten skills that it determined make
up a successful sports person. These were:
1. E ndurance
2. S trength
3. P ower
4. S peed
5. A gility
6. F lexibility
7. H and–eye coordination
8. N erve (defi ned as the ability to maintain composure in a fearful
environment)
9. D urability (defi ned as the ability to withstand constant physical
punishment)
10. Analytic aptitude (defi ned as the ability to evaluate and react to strategic
situations)
E SPN then analyzed 60 sports and asked a group of experts made up of
sports scientists, kinesiology academics, and sporting journalists to assign
a number from 1 to 10 to each of these skills.
The Results Among the 60 sports analyzed, baseball came out tops in
the hand–eye coordination category with a rating of 9.25. Soccer led the
pack in the agility category with a rating of 8.25. Motor racing was number
1 in the nerve category with a rating of 9.88. Track and fi eld sprinting was
placed fi rst in the speed category, also with a rating of 9.88. Finally, boxing
emerged victorious in the durability category with a rating of 8.5.
H ence, to ensure the highest chance of success in any given sport, a
sports coach would put an athlete through a series of tests to determine
his or her strengths and weaknesses. If the athlete scored the highest in
the hand–eye coordination category, the baseball route would be apt.
If the athlete came out tops in the agility category, soccer would be the top
cc0055..iinndddd 9911 0033//1122//1122 99::5555 AAMM

92 FOREX IS A GAME
choice. If the athlete had the best score in the nerve category, a career in
motor racing might beckon.
T rack and fi eld sprinting would be the answer had the athlete aced the
speed category, and, fi nally, an illustrious boxing career wouldn’ t be too far
off if the athlete led in the durability category. Your best chance of achiev-
ing greatness in the sporting world is choosing the sport that best resonates
with your dominant strengths.
Forex trading is like sports. There are many fi elds where success can
be achieved in the forex market. A certain strategy in the forex world corre-
sponds to a certain discipline in the sporting world, whether it is soccer or
boxing. Similarly, the best chance of succeeding in forex trading is select-
ing a toolbox of strategies that complements your personality.
FIVE CATEGORIES OF FOREX TRADERS
Style is important. We hear about style on a daily basis from the mass
media. Not a day goes by without the newspapers, magazines, radio, or TV
promoting a perfume, apparel, a luxury car, a watch, or a mobile phone.
Advertisers know that style is an integral part of our personality.
This is why products are painstakingly created with different textures,
smells, or purposes. Everyone is different, and the best product is the
one that best suits your needs. The products that you buy tell a lot about
the kind of style that you like and reveal much about your personality.
They defi ne who you are.
I t is the same with forex trading: No two traders have exactly the same
style. That’ s why it’ s important for you to choose a style of trading that
resonates with your personality and defi nes who you are. Forex traders the
world over fall into one of fi ve categories: scalpers, day traders, swing trad-
ers, position traders, and mechanical traders. The main difference between
the categories of traders is the time frame employed while trading.
E ssentially, the length of time in which a trading position is held
increases from a scalper to a day trader, to a swing trader, and fi nally to
a position trader. Mechanical traders are oblivious to the passing of time.
Their trades are based on a fi xed routine, regardless of time frame and
regardless of market activity.
Scalpers
Scalpers are traders who like fast action. They enter and exit the forex mar-
ket multiple times a day, taking a few pips each time. Typically, profi ts can
range anywhere from a single pip to 10 pips. These trades can last anywhere
cc0055..iinndddd 9922 0033//1122//1122 99::5555 AAMM

Play It Your Way 93
from several seconds to several minutes. In terms of time frames, scalpers
prefer looking at M1 and M5 charts (minute charts and 5-minute charts).
T heir actions are mostly centered around the overlapping sessions of
the major regions, typically during the Asia close/Europe open, Europe
close/U.S. open. Scalpers trade during these hours mainly because these are
the busiest hours in the forex market on any given day. This business tends
to generate more volume, which in turn presents more trading opportunities.
As they need to react to market movements quickly, scalping is most
suitable for traders who can devote their undivided attention and focus on
the charts for a couple of hours at a time. In addition, scalpers need the
ability to think on their feet and switch the direction of their trades fast if
the situation calls for it.
D ue to the numerous times in which scalpers enter and exit the
markets, there are three simple rules in their toolbox:
1. S preads. The spread on currency pairs is a signifi cant factor in
the scalper’ s strategy. Scalpers tend to stay away from currency
pairs with large spreads and focus only on the major pairs, such as
EUR/USD, GBP/USD, and USD/JPY. They do this because the spread
on the majors is normally the tightest, and the majors have the highest
liquidity.
2. N ews. Scalpers tend to avoid trading during major news announce-
ments. This is because major news can evoke different emotions in
the markets and cause wild swings in currency pairs. The unwelcome
volatility during such news announcements can be the difference
between a winning trade and a losing one.
3. L everage. Scalpers tend to use high leverage because they are in and
out of the market repeatedly with only a small profi t. The high leverage
amplifi es their returns signifi cantly.
Due to the fast-paced nature of scalping, it is not uncommon for
traders to employ automated trading systems to execute trades on their
behalf.
Scalping offers these top three advantages:
1. R isk exposure. Due to the nature of scalping, traders stay in the
market for brief periods each time. This reduces their risk of getting
stopped out by any unforeseen adverse events.
2. E asier bites. Markets can ’t make big moves without fi rst making
small ones. As commonsensical as that sounds, it is also why scalpers
love small moves—they happen more frequently, so scalpers’ chances
of winning are bumped up.
cc0055..iinndddd 9933 0033//1122//1122 99::5555 AAMM

94 FOREX IS A GAME
3. F requency. For markets to achieve signifi cant up or down moves, a
major change in expectations is required. Such changes normally are
caused by primers, such as a major news release. The good news for
scalpers is that even in the absence of news, profi ts can still be made.
Day Traders
T he main distinguishing characteristic of day traders is that they don’ t
like to hold a trading position overnight. Day traders typically put on a
trade at the start of the trading day and tend to close it out before the day
is over. To day traders, fi nishing the day without an open position is more
important than the actual result of the trade itself. This means that the
trade could either be a profi t or a loss.
D epending on the currency pair, the profi t potential per trade for day
traders can range from 20 pips to 40 pips or more. In terms of time frames,
day traders prefer looking at the M15 and the M30 charts (the 15-minute
and the 30-minute chart respectively).
U nlike scalpers who avoid the news, day traders love trading the news.
Keeping abreast of the daily news releases actually help them to plan their
trades more effectively. Additionally, many day traders depend on news
announcements as triggers for their trades.
Day traders are big momentum traders. This means that they look for
a certain directional bias and go long or short based on the current move-
ment, or wave, at that time. Part of the strategy entails looking for possible
breakouts from tight ranges, especially when certain news announcements
fare better or worse than forecasted numbers.
Day trading offers these top three advantages:
1. P eace of mind. Day traders sleep soundly at night knowing that they
do not have any open market positions. As long as a position remains
open in the forex market, it is exposed to risk. Examples of risk include
market gapping, which happens when prices are non-existent during
brief periods because of market volatility.
I f a trader’ s stop loss is located in the gap, the trade might not
close out. If this happens, the trader has a higher risk exposure. Since
day traders close out their positions by the end of the trading day,
market gapping risk is hardly present.
2. E asy analysis. Day traders love the news, because news often injects
momentum and causes currencies to move up or down. As positions
are closed out every day, day traders do not subject themselves to
analysis paralysis. This trading disease happens to many news traders
cc0055..iinndddd 9944 0033//1122//1122 99::5555 AAMM

Play It Your Way 95
who grapple with the concept of how much markets tend to price in
upcoming news or released news.
S ince day traders are momentum traders who take advantage of
the fi rst moves, analysis is easy and straightforward.
3. S tructured calculations. This is also one of the benefi ts of starting
with a clean slate every day. When trades are left hanging in the market,
equity and margin levels constantly fl uctuate to refl ect the current size
of the open position. This fl uctuation can confuse traders who need to
make adjustments when they calculate their lot size for the next trade.
Day traders do not have this problem because trades are closed
out at the end of the day, and lot sizes are calculated on a clean slate
the next day.
Swing Traders
Swing traders normally hold trades beyond a day but never beyond a week.
This trading style is most suited to part-time traders who have full-time
jobs because not much time is needed to analyze the markets and set up
the trade.
D epending on the currency pair, the profi t potential per trade for swing
traders can range from 50 pips to 150 pips or more. In terms of time frames,
swing traders prefer looking at the H1 and the H4 charts (the hourly and the
4-hourly charts respectively).
Swing traders tend to be a bit more conservative than scalpers or
day traders; they typically wait for several confi rmation signals before
triggering a trade.
A t the same time, swing traders are not bothered by intraday volatil-
ity and price swings because they are more concerned with catching the
medium-term trends. Profi t targets and stop-loss levels are naturally larger
for swing traders because they have a slightly longer-term view than day
traders.
Since trades usually have larger targets, spreads won ’t have as much of
an impact to overall profi ts for swing traders. As a result, trading pairs with
larger spreads and lower liquidity is acceptable.
Swing trading offers these top three advantages:
1. F avorable risk to reward. Swing traders normally are not concerned
with intraday movements of the market because they have a slightly
longer time horizon in watching the markets.
A s their time horizon is longer than that of day traders, swing trad-
ers normally set favorable risk to reward ratios of 1:2, 1:3, or more.
cc0055..iinndddd 9955 0033//1122//1122 99::5555 AAMM

96 FOREX IS A GAME
If the stop loss is set at 50 pips, the profi t target is normally 100 pips,
150 pips, or more.
2. S ave time. Swing traders are mostly technical traders, which means
they do not have to spend time every day to keep abreast of fi nancial
news.
This is not to say that news is not important, but due to the swing
trader’s trading style of exiting positions in two to fi ve days, daily news
events don’ t matter much. This is one of the biggest draws of swing
trading and makes the method perfect for new traders or part-time
traders who have full-time jobs.
3. H assle-free. Many traders feel the need to meddle with ongoing
trades or to trigger unnecessary ones. This normally happens when
traders trade several times a day.
A s swing traders depend on a trading plan to trigger long and short
positions, they do not fall into this trap. In fact, swing traders thrive on
following a structured plan. Following a plan keeps human error to a
minimum and enables swing traders to avoid emotional trading.
Position Traders
Position traders have the longest time horizon of the different catego-
ries. The total opposite of scalpers, position traders can sit on a trade for
several weeks to several months. They have a very strong grasp of mar-
ket fundamentals and are able to spot changes that could lead to highly
profi table long-term gains once trades are locked in. Depending on the
currency pair, the profi t potential per trade for position traders can range
from 500 pips to several thousand pips or more.
I n terms of time frames, position traders prefer looking at the D1, W1,
and even the MN charts (daily, weekly, and monthly charts respectively).
Position traders are usually sophisticated investors with two distinct
characteristics: Their astute reading of the fi nancial markets makes them
totally unconcerned with the short-term or even the medium-term move-
ments of the currency market, and they own a large trading account. This
size is necessary because capital is needed to withstand large fl oating
losses should trades go against the trader for an extended period of time.
Position trading offers these top three advantages:
1. L ower transaction costs. Brokers charge a spread for every position
executed in the forex market. Thus, scalpers incur the highest costs by
virtue of their trading frequency. Position traders are on the o pposite
cc0055..iinndddd 9966 0033//1122//1122 99::5555 AAMM

Play It Your Way 97
end of the pole. Instead of executing many trades, position traders
execute very few trades and prefer to manage those trades effectively.
They do this by tightening the stop loss for open positions, which is a
technique of dynamically shifting the stop loss level to chase the price.
A s an example, for long positions, the stop loss is continu-
ously shifted upwards. For short positions, the stop loss is continuously
shifted downwards. This technique helps position traders to lock in
profi ts along the way.
2. E arn swap. In every forex transaction, the trade involves borrowing
one currency to buy another. Interest or swap is paid on the currency
that is borrowed and earned on the one that is bought.
A s an example, if you are buying a currency with a higher interest
rate than the one you are borrowing, the net interest rate differen-
tial will be positive, and you earn interest for every day that the trade
remains open. This is sometimes called the carry trade. Position trad-
ers stand to gain a huge amount of swap when they hold trades for an
extended period of time.
3. C haracter building. Emotions sometimes set in when trades are held
for a long time. Both greed and fear can take over during the course
of the trade. Position traders have to learn to manage greed when a
sizable profi t builds up. They have to weigh the decision of exiting the
trade early to bank the profi ts against holding the trade longer for even
bigger returns.
T he opposite is also true. When trades go against position traders,
fear is bound to set in. They then have to weigh the decision of exiting
the trade early to realize the loss against holding on to the position
in the event markets reverse. Over their trading journeys, position trad-
ers must cultivate patience.
Mechanical Traders
M echanical traders are usually beginners in the forex market. Their main
focus in trading the markets is not time driven but system driven.
A fter mechanical traders go through a period of back-testing with
historical data, they deem a particular strategy sound. Thereafter, these
traders focus only on the execution of that strategy based on its rules. This
method allows them to enter and exit trades without emotions or stress.
Due to the robotic application of mechanical trading, it is not uncom-
mon to fi nd mechanical traders coding their strategies into automated
trading systems that can be fi red off on cue. Once these systems are
cc0055..iinndddd 9977 0033//1122//1122 99::5555 AAMM

98 FOREX IS A GAME
trading automatically, traders have the added advantage of further back-
testing the automated systems with more historical data to ensure that
it remains robust.
However, the very nature of robotic application is a double-edged
sword. Since no discretionary trading takes place, an automated system
can lull mechanical traders into a false sense of security.
This false security becomes a problem when market conditions change,
as when interest rates are raised or lowered or when central banks inter-
vene to pump liquidity into the fi nancial system. Such acts undoubtedly
affect the currency volatility and trading ranges.
I f automated systems are not tweaked periodically to refl ect chang-
ing market conditions, mechanical traders can be in for a rough time with
prolonged losses on their trading account.
Mechanical trading offers these top three advantages:
1. N o monitoring needed. Once mechanical traders are confident
that the system works, absolutely no monitoring of the market
is needed, because mechanical traders are mostly system driven.
Trades are executed faithfully (sometimes several times a day)
regardless of how the market moves.
2. F lexible trading. Since mechanical traders are not dependent on
any specifi c time frame, they are able to formulate trading systems to
exploit the movements of any currency pair. This gives them the fl ex-
ibility to trawl all available currency pairs on the broker’s platform and
build a mechanical system around it.
3. F ree time. A fair amount of mechanical traders utilize expert advisors
(EAs) on their trading platform to assist in trade execution. EAs are
essentially automated trading systems. Because the model is hands-
free, these mechanical traders have the time to pursue other work
interests and hobbies.
YOUR PERFECT STRATEGY
W e are how we trade and we trade how we are. No two traders are exactly
alike. Your unique personality will cause you to trade differently from
someone else. If you enjoy a fast-paced life fi lled with action from the word
Go!, you most likely fall into the scalper category.
If you are holding down a job and don ’t have too much time to monitor
the markets, you most likely fall into the swing trader category. It is import-
ant to note that no one category is better or worse than the other. They are
all the same in terms of making you a consistently profi table trader.

Scorecard
25–34: Scalper
You are a true-blue scalper. You like to have fun and variety is the name of the
game. You get bored easily, which is why you live a life fi lled with activities.
As an individual, you are not afraid to be original or contrarian. However, you
display a mildly aggressive nature when things don ’t go your way.
You like the excitement of fast-moving markets, and you don’ t like it when
trades take too long to exit. Your ability to focus on the charts for several hours
at a time is an important part of your success.
Impatience stands out as one of your characteristics, because you expect
your trades to become profi table immediately. As a scalper, impatience can
work in your favor too, because you will exit trades promptly if they go
against you. Additionally, this quick-thinking helps you to maintain a fl exible
mind-set when setting up new trades in the opposite direction when the need
calls for it.
35–46: Scalper/Day Trader
You are an excitable and passionate individual. You are a person who does
not do well with details as your current lifestyle does not have a fi xed routine
yet. As a scalper/day trader, you embody characteristics in both categories.
Sometimes you love the action when markets are moving fast. At other times,
you tend to get stressed in the same market conditions.
Due to your time fl exibility, on some days you can commit several hours
looking at the charts. However, on days when your schedule fi lls up, you can
only afford to glance at the charts for several minutes each time. You like to
vary your trading style according to the time you have. When time permits, you
prefer to spend hours looking at the charts and scalp, taking a few pips each
time. When time is a factor, you prefer to pick the best trade setup for that day.
You are extremely delighted when your trade registers a profi t, but your
mood sours considerably when you hit a loss. The good news is that when you
are wrong, you don ’t have a problem owning up to it. As part of your person-
ality, you like to experiment with different trading strategies and systems to
keep your interest from waning.

47–56: Day Trader
You are a true-blue day trader. You like to keep abreast of news and watch the
markets for any moves throughout the day. As a tech-savvy individual, you love
your gadgets and probably own at least a laptop, a tablet, and a smart phone.
These devices help you to stay on top of the markets. Analytical and unbiased,
you take pride in crunching the numbers after you have done your research
and data mining.
Sometimes you take it a step further and calculate all possible scenarios
and outcomes for each trade before triggering it. You are not afraid of risk. In
fact, one of your strengths lies in effective risk management because you might
have a couple of open trades in a day. You are not known for reckless trading,
but at odd times you throw caution to the wind and enter a trade when not all
the rules have been met. During those times, you fi nd it diffi cult to cut your
losses because of your nature to defend your decisions.
The great part about you is that you like to face and solve challenges.
Life is an adventure, and you look forward to new things every day. Your zest
reveals your personality as an individual who does not allow problems to weigh
you down.
57–68: Day/Swing Trader
You are an optimistic person who is dedicated to improving yourself every
day. You are well-read and street-smart, and your life has pretty much settled
down into a fi xed routine in terms of work and play. As a busy person, you
pride yourself in effective time management, and you usually keep a daily
to-do list that helps you prioritize your activities. Due to your working hours,
you are content to take a smaller number of trades daily or weekly.
You like to plan ahead, and the main reason for you starting to trade is to
build up a second income to complement your active income. Occasionally,
when you have some spare time, you tend to overanalyze your trade setups.
This sometimes results in a tendency to abandon your game plan because you
are swayed by different sources of information.
69–78: Swing Trader
You are a true-blue swing trader. Your day job takes up most of your time,
but you enjoy trading on the side. In fact, because of your lack of time, you
actually like it that you don ’t have to analyze the market too much.
You are comfortable to sit and wait for the best trade setup and are not
at all bothered with how prices fl uctuate during the day. In fact, you know too
well that too much time spent looking at the charts can bring about the danger
of emotional trading.
You classify yourself as a conservative person who doesn ’t enjoy taking
unnecessary risks. Unlike most traders, who don ’t have a trading plan, you
thrive on having a solid trading plan. Rules are clearly defi ned, and you know
exactly when to enter and exit a trade.
Once you decide on a trade, you are not easily swayed to change it. You are
perfectly fi ne to see your trade fl uctuate between profi t and loss, as your main
concern is whether you followed all the rules and executed the trade correctly.
Your eye is fi rmly fi xed on a favorable risk to reward ratio.

106 FOREX IS A GAME
The best thing that you like about forex trading is that it doesn’ t cause you
to alter your lifestyle. After all, when you execute a couple of trades a week,
the result is a steady increase in part-time income.
79–90: Swing/Position Trader
You are an independent thinker who ignores popular opinion. As a rational
and practical individual, you make your own decisions after taking in all the
relevant information. You are fully aware that frequent trading leads to more
mistakes. Hence, you adjust your trading style to take fewer trades with bigger
gains. An avid reader of the markets, you have a good grasp of the fundamen-
tals and how countries are managing their economies.
However, your depth and insights on the markets can sometimes be a
double-edged sword. Due to your analysis of mid- to long-term trends, procras-
tination sometimes can set in. This keeps you from executing the trade even
though all the rules have been met.
If left unchecked, your procrastination can slowly take root in your char-
acter. You now tend to look for more reasons to substantiate each trade entry,
or lack thereof. This vicious cycle can affect your trading style if you don’ t take
steps to rectify it.
97–100: Position Trader
You are a true-blue position trader. You are a calm soul who’ s sensitive to feelings
and don ’t enjoy confl ict. As an individual, you are more intuitive than analytical.
Stress is a foreign word because you don’ t have much of it in your life. You are
able to detach any emotional highs and lows you experience in trading.
Due to your trading style, you prefer to trade with a large account size
to help you weather fl uctuations of hundreds or even thousands of pips. You
hardly ever look at technicals as your main focus is on the fundamentals of how
governments run their countries.
You are able to see the big picture of how monetary policies and fi scal poli-
cies affect currency movements farther down the road. Your biggest virtue is
patience, as you don ’t mind waiting several weeks or months for your reward.
101 and above: Mechanical Trader
You are a true-blue mechanical trader. You like routine and structure in life.
Sometimes, eating your favorite food every day for a week makes you happy.
As a newbie in the forex market, you get overwhelmed with all the infor-
mation out there. You want to get started, but you ’re just not sure how. Hence,
you depend on a robust system to help you make educated decisions. The sys-
tem you settle for either requires you to spend a few minutes a day to trigger
the trade or trades on its own via automated software.
You have tried to make sense of the news that impacts the market, but that
has been the cause of your stress. This is because you realize that news occurs
on a daily basis, and you either can’ t keep up with it or you don’ t want to do so.
News is the main reason you have a love-hate relationship with the forex mar-
ket. You know that fundamental news causes the prices to move, but you can ’t
manage the unpredictable way in which it does. You settle for a trading methodol-
ogy that disregards the impact of news. Doing this takes the stress out of trading
and puts the focus on delivering a style that is both profi table and system driven.

SUMMARY
The perfect strategy to use in the forex market is the one that perfectly
suits you. Two traders can employ the exact same strategy but have differ-
ent results. This is mainly due to the trader ’s personality, which causes him
or her to meddle with the trade as it is engaged.
There are essentially fi ve categories of traders in the world: scalp-
ers, day traders, swing traders, position traders, and mechanical traders.
The main difference among the categories of traders is the time frames
employed while trading.
E ssentially, the length of time in which a trading position is held
increases from a scalper to a day trader, to a swing trader, and fi nally to
a position trader. Mechanical traders are oblivious to the passing of time.
Their trades are based on a fi xed routine, regardless of time frame and
regardless of market activity.
N o one category of traders is better than the other, as each category
has its own unique characteristics and advantages. The end goal for all
categories of traders is the same: to be consistently profi table when trading
the forex market.
Just as sports coaches put athletes through a series of tests to ascertain
their dominant strengths, budding forex traders must determine their own
strengths. Finding your fl ow as a trader is critical to your goal of becoming
a profi table trader once and for all.

PART TWO
Strategies to Win
the Game
T
his part is divided into fi ve chapters. Each chapter covers strate-
gies for the fi ve profi les of scalper, day trader, swing trader, position
trader, and mechanical trader.
C hapter 6 covers two strategies for scalpers, called the rapid fi re and
the piranha. These strategies are used on the lowest time frames, namely the
minute chart and the 5-minute chart.
Chapter 7 covers four strategies for day traders. The fi rst two strategies
are focused on breakouts while the next two are centered purely on trading
the news. A unique way of trading the news, called the Rule of 20, is also
discussed here. All four strategies are employed using the 15-minute and
30-minute time frame.
Chapter 8 covers fi ve strategies for swing traders. As swing traders
typically exit their positions within two to fi ve days, the time frames used
for the strategies are longer than the day traders. Hence, all fi ve of the
swing trading strategies are used on the hourly and the 4-hourly time
frame.
Chapter 9 covers three strategies for position traders. The first one,
swap and fly, takes advantage of interest rate differentials between
the currencies and aims to earn maximum returns by holding on to
positions for an extended period of time. The next two strategies are
used specifically for the two most popular commodities in the world:
oil and gold.

110 STRATEGIES TO WIN THE GAME
Chapter 10 covers three strategies for mechanical traders. Traders in
this category are oblivious to the passing of time. This is why all strategies
discussed here employ three different time frames from the other
categories: the 5-minute chart, the 15-minute chart, and the daily chart.

CHAPTER 6
Strategies for
Scalpers
A
s a scalper, you love strategies characterized by high-volume trading.
These strategies are designed to enter the market frequently, taking
small profi ts each time.
Most scalping strategies employ either indicators (including custom
indicators) or price action (including candlestick patterns) or a combina-
tion of both. Ideally, the strategies should be employed on the lowest time
frames available on the broker ’s platform.
T he two scalping techniques discussed here—rapid fi re and piranha—
are developed on the M1 (1-minute) and M5 (5-minute) charts respectively.
These two time frames give you ample opportunities to enter in and out of
the market several times a day. Although scalping can be very exciting, the
constant monitoring of market movements can give rise to fatigue and loss
of focus.
Hence, you need to know when to take a break or call it a day. Failure
to do so could result in unwarranted mistakes. To overcome this, establish
simple guidelines or rules for yourself.
As an example, say: “I will take a break after trading for one hour” or
“I will stop trading after I hit my daily target of 20 pips.”
R emember, overtrading does not necessarily yield more profi ts. As a
scalper, your most important tools are a very reliable computer, a high-speed
Internet connection, and a pot of coffee to help you stay awake.
STRATEGY 1: RAPID-FIRE STRATEGY
The rapid-fi re strategy was designed with two criteria in mind:
1. T he most liquid currency pair in the world
2. T he lowest time frame available
111
cc0066..iinndddd 111111 0033//1122//1122 99::5555 AAMM

112 STRATEGIES TO WIN THE GAME
T his criterion led to the development of the strategy on the minute
chart (M1) for the EUR/USD currency pair.
The M1 time frame is fast-paced and exhilarating. If you are not careful,
the adrenaline rush you experience can cloud your trading decisions. This
problem is compounded by the high frequency of trading opportunities that
the strategy presents. On average, there are about 30 to 40 trading opportu-
nities for the rapid-fi re strategy every day.
This is the reason why the rapid-fi re strategy employs two indicators to
assist you in spotting objective trades throughout the day. You can then fi re
off the trade rapidly once you decide to take it.
Time Frame
The rapid-fi re strategy works with the 1-minute (M1) time frame. Each
candlestick on the chart represents 1 minute of price movement.
Indicators
We use these indicators for the rapid-fi re strategy:
1. P arabolic SAR with default setting:
a. S tep 0.02
b. Maximum 0.2
2. S imple moving average (SMA), period 60, and apply to close.
Parabolic SAR The “step” is also known as the acceleration factor
(AF), and it starts at a minimum value of 0.02. Maximum 0.2 means that
the AF can reach a maximum of 0.2, no matter how long the uptrend or
downtrend extends. A higher step basically moves the SAR closer to the
price action, which makes a reversal more likely. If the step is set too high,
the indicator reverses often and produces whipsaws.
T he Parabolic SAR is an indicator developed by J. Welles Wilder to
fi nd trends in market prices. The acronym “SAR” stands for “stop and
reverse.”
SAR ( i ) = SAR ( i − 1 ) + AF × { EPRICE − SAR ( i − 1 ) }
Where:
SAR (i) = the value of the indicator on the current bar;
SAR(i − 1) = the value of the indicator on the previous bar;
cc0066..iinndddd 111122 0033//1122//1122 99::5555 AAMM

Strategies for Scalpers 113
AF = the acceleration factor. This factor is increased by 0.02 each time
a new EPRICE is recorded.
E PRICE (Extreme Price) = the highest price reached during the cur-
rent uptrend or the lowest price during a downtrend. In each
trend, when the price reaches a new high or low, the EPRICE will
be updated to that value.
T raders utilize the positions of the Parabolic SAR to generate buy or
sell signals. A bullish signal is generated when the dots of the Parabolic
SAR is below the price, causing traders to expect the upward momen-
tum to continue. Conversely, a bearish signal is generated when the dot is
above the price, causing traders to expect the downward momentum to
continue.
T he indicator works extremely well when markets are moving in a
trend.
Simple Moving Average 60 A simple moving average (SMA) is
calculated by adding the price of the candlestick over a given number
of periods and then dividing this total sum by the number of periods.
Since this strategy uses minute candlesticks, SMA 60 (apply to close)
is the sum of closing prices for 60 candles divided by 60. The fi gures
are dynamic, which means that old data are dropped as new ones are
added. This rolling fi gure causes the moving average to move along the
time scale.
T he most common use of the SMA is to identify the direction of mar-
ket momentum. When the market price is above the moving average, the
market is deemed to have a bullish momentum and traders will look for an
entry to go long. When the market price is below the moving average, the
market is deemed to have a bearish momentum and traders will look for an
entry to go short.
Currency Pairs
The strategy is designed specifi cally for the EUR/USD, the most traded cur-
rency pair in the world.
Strategy Concept
T he strategy concept is a trend-scalping strategy, which means it works
best in a trend. The strategy combines two trend indicators, SMA 60 and
cc0066..iinndddd 111133 0033//1122//1122 99::5555 AAMM

114 STRATEGIES TO WIN THE GAME
Parabolic SAR with default setting (step 0.02). The SMA 60 is used to
identify the direction of the momentum. This means that we look to long
EUR/USD when the price is above the SMA 60. Similarly, we look to
short EUR/USD when the price is below the SMA 60.
T he Parabolic SAR is used to give the exact entry signal for both long
and short positions. When the price for EUR/USD goes above the Parabolic
SAR, we fi re off a long trade. When the price for EUR/USD goes below the
Parabolic SAR, we fi re off a short trade.
Long Trade Setup
Here are the steps to execute a long trade using the rapid-fi re strategy:
1. L ook for the market price to go above the SMA 60.
2. W ait for the Parabolic SAR to move above the market price.
3. O nce the market price goes above the Parabolic SAR, the Parabolic
SAR will appear below the market price. This is the signal to enter for
long. (See Figure 6.1 .)
4. T he stop loss is set at 15 pips below the entry price.
5. T he profi t target is set at 10 pips above the entry price. (See
Figure 6.2 .)

Strategy Roundup
The rapid-fi re strategy could give you another trade signal even before the
current trade exits. It is not uncommon to encounter consecutive trading
signals one after the other, simply because of the low time frame used.
cc0066..iinndddd 111177 0033//1122//1122 99::5555 AAMM

118 STRATEGIES TO WIN THE GAME
As a scalper, you have to decide how to manage the trades, especially
when the setups come fast and furious. Do you exit the previous trade
before entering a new one, ignore any new trade signals until the current
trade exits, or simply fi re off whenever there is a trade signal?
Remember, the rapid-fi re strategy works best in a trending environment.
It requires fast thinking and nimble reactions. It is most suitable for action-
driven traders who can maintain their composure while in the thick of action.
STRATEGY 2: PIRANHA STRATEGY
T he forex market spends most of its time either in a trend or in a range. The
rapid-fi re scalping strategy works best in a trend. The piranha strategy was
developed to work when markets move in a range.
Let us get right into the world of the piranhas. Piranhas take small fre-
quent bites off their prey until it is totally devoured. Although a single bite
may not cause much harm, the frequency of the bites causes the attack to
be deadly. In much the same way, the piranha strategy was developed
to give scalpers ample opportunities to bite the market and chew off small
profi ts each time.
T his strategy is designed specifi cally for the GBP/USD currency pair,
using the 5-minute (M5) time frame. On average, there are about 15 to 20
trading opportunities for the piranha strategy every day.
Time Frame
T he piranha strategy works with the 5-minute (M5) time frame. This means
that each candlestick on the chart represents 5 minutes of price movement.
Indicators
We use this indicator for the piranha strategy:
One set of Bollinger Bands
a. P eriod 12, Shift 0.
b. Deviation 2 (default).
D eveloped by technical trader John Bollinger, Bollinger Bands consist
of three lines, with the simple moving average in the center and the outer
Bands plotted using standard deviation formula away from the simple
moving average.
cc0066..iinndddd 111188 0033//1122//1122 99::5555 AAMM

Strategies for Scalpers 119
S tandard deviation is a measure of price volatility. When markets
become more volatile, the Bands widen and move farther from the center
moving average line. The formulas to calculate the upper and lower Bands
are:
Upper band = SMA + ( D × Std Dev )
Lower band = SMA − ( D × Std Dev )
Where:
SMA = Simple moving average
D = Deviation value (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.)
Std Dev = Standard deviation
D ue to the complexity of the formula, I will not focus too much on it;
instead, I focus more on the signifi cance of the upper and lower Bands.
When prices approach the upper band, it is considered to be in an
overbought region. When prices approach the lower band, it is considered
oversold. At these extreme levels, markets tend to consolidate and move
back to the center moving average line.
B y setting a higher deviation value, the price volatility measure will be
magnifi ed, and you will get a Bollinger band with wider upper and lower
Bands.
Currency Pairs
T he strategy is designed for the cable, which is the nickname for the
currency pair GBP/USD.
Strategy Concept
Bollinger Bands are used to identify the trading band of the GBP/USD.
The Bands help us to mimic the nature of the piranhas by giving objective
entries for long and short positions. (See Figure 6.7 .)
Long trades are taken when market prices touch the bottom band;
short trades are taken when market prices touch the upper band.
Piranhas are active in relatively calm waters, such as rivers, but not
in the rough open seas with strong currents and waves. In much the same
way, avoid trading this strategy at times of major news releases during the
U.S. and U.K. trading hours, as such environments refl ect the rough open
seas with strong currents and waves. We use the GBP/USD currency pair
on the M5 time frame to illustrate both long and short trades.

T he risk for this trade is 10 pips, and the reward is 5 pips. The risk to
reward ratio is 2:1, which yields us a 1.5% return if we take a 3% risk.
Short Trade Setup
Here are the steps to execute a short trade using the piranha strategy:
1. W ait for the market to touch the upper band of the Bollinger Bands.
2. E nter for a short when the market touches the upper band of the
Bollinger Bands. (See Figure 6.11 .)
3. S et the stop loss at 10 pips above the entry price.
4. S et the profi t target at 5 pips below the entry price. (See Figure 6.12 .)
From the short example in Figure 6.13 :
Entry price = 1.5941
Stop loss = 1.5951
Profit target = 1.5936
T he risk for this trade is 10 pips, and the reward is 5 pips. The risk to
reward ratio is 2:1, which yields us a 1.5% return if we take a 3% risk.

Strategy Roundup
A t the beginning of this section, I mentioned that piranhas attack their prey
until it is totally devoured. In much the same way, once your trade hits a
cc0066..iinndddd 112233 0033//1122//1122 99::5555 AAMM

124 STRATEGIES TO WIN THE GAME
stop loss, the loss is telling you that there is nothing left of your prey and
it ’s time to look for a new one.
H ence, hitting a stop loss is a telltale sign that the market is no longer
trading in a band and it is starting to move into a trend. So how do you look
for the next prey?
The answer is to look for a trade that is in the opposite direction of
your stop-loss trade. For example, if you took a long trade that resulted
in a stop loss, look to short the GBP/USD at the next opportunity with the
same rules.
T his is an important consideration and a neat trick for you to navigate
yourself in trending markets. As this strategy was designed primarily for
range trading, it fails badly when the market goes into a strong trend.

CHAPTER 7
Strategies for Day
Traders
A
s a day trader, your biggest pet peeve is holding trading positions
overnight. You are more concerned with fi nishing the day without an
open position than the actual result of the trade itself.
Your trades are characterized by profi t targets of around 20 to 50 pips
per trade. Most day trading strategies involve a combination of both techni-
cal and fundamental analysis.
For technical analysis, chart patterns, candlestick patterns, and
indicators are important considerations. For fundamental analysis, trading
important news, such as non-farm payrolls (NFP) and interest rates, is the
focus.
F our strategies are discussed in this section. The fi rst two—fade
the break and trade the break—are centered on technical analysis. The
next two—gawk the talk and balk the talk—are centered on fundamental
analysis, or news trading.
A ll strategies are developed using the 15-minute (M15) time frame
and the 30-minute (M30) time frame. The biggest reason why these time
frames are most suited for day traders is because the positions are most
likely to exit in a day. As a day trader, the biggest frustration that you will
face is the constant dilemma of leaving a trade open or exiting it manu-
ally. Sometimes, Murphy’ s Law strikes when you decide to exit the trade
manually, sending your trade to its intended profi t level had you left it
open in the fi rst place.
T o prevent such scenarios, set some guidelines for yourself when it
comes to closing off your open positions. An example could be “I will close
off my position exactly at 11 P.M. every day, regardless of the trading result.”
An objective rule like that can help you to manage your positions better—
and prevent Murphy ’s Law from striking in the future.

STRATEGY 3: FADE THE BREAK
T he forex market is a constant battle between bulls and bears. Sometimes
this fi ght occurs between retail and institutional traders. It is common
knowledge that institutional traders prey on unassuming retail traders who
sometimes engage in emotional trading.
Fade the break is a strategy that follows the trail of the institutional
traders. It allows retail traders like you and me to pick up the clues of the
smart money. Let ’s get right into it.
Time Frame
T he fade the break strategy works with the 15-minute (M15) or 30-minute
(M30) candle. This means that each candle on the chart represents 15 or
30 minutes of price movement.
Indicators
N o indicators are used for this strategy. We use support and resistance
levels only.
Currency Pairs
T his strategy is suitable for all currency pairs listed on the broker’ s plat-
form, especially the seven major currency pairs of:
EUR/USD
USD/JPY
GBP/USD
USD/CHF
USD/CAD
AUD/USD
NZD/USD
Strategy Concept
Markets often reverse after a failure to break above the resistance level or
below the support level. At the resistance level, the failure is characterized
by the shadow of the candle that goes above the resistance level but fails to
close above it. Subsequently the price falls back below the resistance level.
cc0077..iinndddd 112266 0066//1122//1122 22::5533 PPMM

Strategies for Day Traders 127
At the support level, the failure is characterized by the shadow of
the candle that goes below the support level but fails to close below it.
Subsequently the price rises above the support level.
Many retail traders get caught at exactly these levels because they
take the “break” of the resistance as a signal that prices will continue to
go up. Similarly, they assume that the break of the support is a signal that
prices will continue to move down. Let’ s see how to trade this setup when
it occurs.
Long Trade Setup
W e use the EUR/USD on the M30 time frame to illustrate long trades. Here
are the steps to execute the fade the break strategy for long:
1. I dentify the support level.
2. I dentify a candle that has a shadow that goes below the support level.
3. W ait for that candle to close as a bull candle. This is called the false-
break candle. (See Figure 7.1 .)
4. E nter at the opening of the next candle.
5. S et a stop loss of 5 pips below the low price of the false break candle.
6. S et two profi t targets for this trade. Set the two targets at a risk to
reward ratio of 1:1 and 1:2 respectively. (See Figure 7.2 .)

entry price.

Entry price = 1.3090
Stop loss = 1.3062

Profit target 1 = 1.3118
Proft target 2 = 1.3146
The risk for this trade is 28 pips, and the reward is 56 pips if both tar-
gets are hit. The risk to reward ratio is 1:2, which yields a tidy 6% return if
we take a 3% risk.
Short Trade Setup
We use the GBP/USD on the M15 time frame to illustrate short trades. Here
are the steps to execute the fade the break strategy for short:
1. I dentify the resistance level.
2. I dentify a candle that has a shadow that goes above the resistance level.
3. W ait for that candle to close as a bear candle. This is called the false-
break candle. (See Figure 7.4 .)

6. S et two profi t targets for this trade. Set the two targets at a risk to
reward ratio of 1:1 and 1:2 respectively. (See Figure 7.5 .)
7. I n this example, the stop loss is 22 pips, the fi rst profi t target is 22 pips
from the entry price, and the second profi t target is 44 pips from the
entry price.

Strategy Roundup
T he main reason why false breaks occur is due to the tussle between retail
and institutional traders. Both groups of traders easily identify levels of
support and resistance, and false breaks are big clues for us retail traders
that there is a lack of momentum to push prices further.
R emember that false breaks are traps to catch day traders off guard.
However, fade the break helps us to turn these traps into opportunities.
STRATEGY 4: TRADE THE BREAK
In the previous strategy, we discussed a method to trade the market when
prices fail to close above resistance or below support. In trade the break,
we see exactly where to place our entries and exits for both short and
long positions. The biggest difference between trade the break and fade
the break is that for trade the break, prices have to close above resistance
or below support.
For this strategy, the trick is not so much in the entry price but in the
stop loss. Many retail traders have no problem identifying areas of entry
since the directional bias is to follow the momentum. However, the correct
placement of the stop loss is what separates winners from losers.
You see, as with the previous fade the break strategy, both retail and
institutional traders closely watch areas of support and resistance. More
often than not, these areas are the biggest battlegrounds between these two
groups of traders. This is why prices sometimes reverse quickly once they
break above resistance or below support.
W hen we learn how to place the stop loss correctly for these trades,
many potential “losers” can in fact turn into winners. Let ’s get right into it.
Time Frame
T rade the break works with the 15-minute (M15) or 30-minute (M30) candle.
This means that each candle on the chart represents 15 minutes or 30 min-
utes of price movement.
Indicators
No indicators are used for this strategy.

form, especially the seven major currency pairs of:
EUR/USD
USD/JPY
GBP/USD
USD/CHF
USD/CAD
AUD/USD
NZD/USD
Strategy Concept
T rade the break is all about momentum. A big clue is seen when prices close
above resistance or below support. This clue tells us that momentum is
building strongly on one side. When prices close above resistance, that can-
dle is called the breakout candle. A long trade is then taken at the opening
price of the next candle. The stop loss is placed below the midpoint of the
prior range because we do not expect prices to fall back below that point.
W hen prices close below support, that candle is also called the breakout
candle. A short trade is then taken at the opening price of the next candle.
The stop loss is placed above the midpoint of the prior range because we do
not expect prices to rise above that point.
Long Trade Setup
W e use the AUD/USD on M15 time frame to illustrate long trades. Here are
the steps to execute the trade the break strategy for long:
1. U se at least two lows and two highs to identify the support and
resistance levels. (See Figure 7.7 .)
2. I dentify a candle that closes above the resistance. This is the breakout
candle. (See Figure 7.8 .)
3. E nter long at the opening of the next candle.
4. S et the stop loss at the 60% mark of the range (distance between the
support and resistance) below the resistance. In this example, the dis-
tance between the support and resistance is 41 pips; the stop loss is set
at 25 pips below the resistance.

Strategy Roundup
A s a trader, our job is not to predict but to react. In other words, we should
not second-guess where the market is going and execute trades based
on assumptions. Whenever the market approaches resistance or support
levels, traders tend to jump in prematurely, which can yield disastrous
consequences when the markets don ’t go the way we want.
I nstead, a better option is to wait for the story to unfold. It certainly
pays to wait for a confirmation before jumping onboard the breakout
bandwagon. The confirmation comes in the form of the breakout can-
dle that closes above the resistance or below the support. This is the
market ’s way of telling us that it has enough momentum to continue
the run.
By now, you must have realized that the two strategies—fade the
break and trade the break—work hand in hand. Both strategies require
us to pause and wait for a confi rmation candle before deciding what to
do. These candles are either false-break candles or breakout candles.
With these two strategies, we can take a trade regardless of market
direction.

138 STRATEGIES TO WIN THE GAME
TRADING THE NEWS
T rading the news is one of the best ways I know of making good profi ts in
a short time with bearable risk. This is because volatility is highest during
these announcements, and traders tend to look out for these times to capi-
talize on price movements for a quick profi t.
I f you are a trader who loves making trading decisions around news
announcements, the next two strategies are for you. One of the greatest advan-
tages of news trading is accessibility. Today, more than ever before, we are
able to access the results as soon as they are released and trade off them.
Many free websites report economic news events almost hourly. The one
that I use daily is a site called forexfactory.com . The site is very user friendly,
and the economic calendar allows you to view the upcoming news at a glance.
T he news comes with color-coded fl ags, with red fl ags signifying the
greatest potential impact. I prefer trading these red fl ags as opposed to
the orange or yellow ones because the potential for big movements is
higher. These red fl ags are also the basis for the events discussed in the
next section.
The top seven news that cause the greatest moves in the forex market
are discussed next.
Interest Rates
A s discussed in Chapter 2 , central banks usually raise or lower interest
rates to achieve a particular infl ation target. If the current infl ation is below
their target, banks may cut the rate to entice consumers to spend more,
given the cheaper borrowing rate. In this way, banks increase the demand
for goods and services.
A n increase in demand for goods and services would result in an
increase in infl ation. Conversely, banks may hike their rate if the current
infl ation reading is above their target. Making borrowing costs more expen-
sive puts a curb on demand and spending and thus lowers infl ation. High
interest rates subsequently cause funds to fl ow into that particular country
as compared to a country with relatively lower rates.
K ey point: When a country raises interest rates, its currency tends to
strengthen.
Gross Domestic Product
G ross domestic product (GDP) is considered the broadest measure of a
country ’s economy because it represents the monetary value of all goods
cc0077..iinndddd 113388 0066//1122//1122 22::5533 PPMM

Strategies for Day Traders 139
and services produced within a country ’s borders in a specifi c time period,
usually a year. Most countries target economic growth at a rate of about 2%
per year. When GDP fi gures are rising, demand for the nation’ s currency
increases. This causes its currency to rise in value against other curren-
cies. In much the same way, a decreasing GDP could mean that a country
is not growing. In fact, a recession is defi ned as two consecutive quarters
of negative growth.
H ence, lower GDP fi gures tend to decrease the country’ s value because
growth is stunted and confi dence is affected. This causes foreign capital
to leave the country and, in turn, lowers the value of its currency against
other currencies.
K ey point: When GDP fi gures are better than expected, the currency
tends to strengthen.
Employment
Employment data is highly sought after by retail traders. In the United
States, this news is termed the non-farm payrolls (NFP), and it accounts for
about 80% of the workers who contribute to the GDP. The NFP is released
on the fi rst Friday of every month and is arguably the most traded piece of
news worldwide.
The NFP report is statistical data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics. It represents the total number of paid U.S. workers of any busi-
ness, excluding:
• General government employees
• Private household employees
• Employees of nonprofi t organizations that provide assistance to indi-
viduals
• Farm employees
The fi gures in an NFP report indicate the number of jobs created in
that particular month. Increasing employment levels signal robust growth,
which directly increases consumer spending and causes confi dence to rise.
Naturally, the added effect of consumer spending and confi dence brings
about demand for US dollars and causes it to rise.
A n increase in unemployment levels in a country tends to signal a slow-
down in growth because consumer spending falls. This slowdown impacts
demand for goods and services and causes business confi dence to drop as
well. Even those still employed tend to worry about the future and reduce
cc0077..iinndddd 113399 0066//1122//1122 22::5533 PPMM

140 STRATEGIES TO WIN THE GAME
spending. As demand continues to falter, the currency supply builds up,
and its value decreases against other currencies.
Key point: When employment fi gures are higher than expected, the cur-
rency tends to strengthen.
Trade Balance
The trade balance measures the ratio of exports to imports for a given
country’ s economy. If exports are higher than imports (called a trade sur-
plus), the trade balance will be positive. If imports are higher than exports
(called a trade defi cit), the trade balance will be negative.
Trade balance is derived primarily from three factors:
1. T he price of goods in a country
2. T ax and tariff levies on imported or exported goods
3. T he exchange rate between two currencies
T his last factor is fundamental to forex trading. Since the trade
balance depends so heavily on the current state of exchange rates between
two countries, the trade balance is a key indicator of a country’ s economic
health.
K ey point: When trade balance fi gures are higher than expected, the
currency tends to strengthen.
Consumer Price Index
T he consumer price index (CPI) is the best measure of infl ation for any
country. It measures the change in the cost of a fi xed basket of products
and services, including housing, electricity, food, and transportation. The
CPI is published monthly. In some countries, the CPI is called the infl ation
index or the cost-of-living index.
A high CPI fi gure shows that the infl ation in a country is high. Most
countries tend to keep the annual infl ation rate between the 2% and 3%
mark. If infl ation is stubbornly above the fi gures set by a country, its
central bank will lean toward a higher interest rate to cool infl ationary
pressures.
The expectation of a higher interest rate and the subsequent interest
rate hike by the central bank will cause the currency to appreciate.
Key point: When CPI fi gures are higher than expected, the currency
tends to strengthen in anticipation of an interest rate hike.

Purchasing Manufacturing Index
In the United States, the Purchasing Manufacturing Index (PMI) measures
the activity level of about 400 purchasing managers in the manufacturing
sector. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, and a reading below 50
indicates contraction.
P urchasing managers are surveyed on fi ve subtopics with these
breakdowns:
1. P roduction level—25%
2. N ew orders—30%
3. S upplier deliveries—15%
4. I nventories—10%
5. E mployment level—20%
Traders watch these surveys closely because purchasing managers
have early access to data about their company ’s performance. Hence
the PMI alone can act as a leading indicator for the overall economic
health of the country. A rising trend has a positive effect on the nation ’s
currency.
Variations of the PMI include:
• I nstitute for Supply Management (ISM) Non-Manufacturing Report
on Business (United States)
• Construction PMI (Great Britain)
• Services PMI (United States, Great Britain)
• Ivey PMI (Canada)
K ey point: When PMI fi gures are higher than expected, the currency
tends to strengthen.
Retail Sales
F igures for retail sales give the best gauge for consumer spending and
possible clues into infl ation data and, ultimately, the direction of inter-
est rates. Retail sales track the dollar value of merchandise sold within
the retail trade by sampling companies engaged in the business of selling
end products to consumers. Generally, the most volatile components are
transportation, accommodation, and food prices.
cc0077..iinndddd 114411 0066//1122//1122 22::5533 PPMM

142 STRATEGIES TO WIN THE GAME
I f retail sales growth is stagnant or slowing down, it tells us that con-
sumers are not spending at previous levels, and could signal a recession
due to the fact that personal consumption is needed to maintain robust
growth in the economy.
Key point: When retail sales fi gures are higher than expected, the cur-
rency tends to strengthen in anticipation of an interest rate hike.
Rule of 20
News traders compare three different news fi gures:
1. P revious
2. F orecast
3. A ctual
Previous fi gures denote the data that were last released. Forecast
fi gures tell us what the analysts or economists expect the fi gures to be
this time round. Actual fi gures are the reported data when they come out.
Here’ s an inside scoop: Traders trade based on expectations. This means
that the previous fi gures are not really important to their trading deci-
sions. In fact, on their own, forecasted fi gures do not have much weight
either.
The trick is to compare the forecasted fi gures with the actual fi gures.
This is where the Rule of 20 comes in. The Rule of 20 states: If the devia-
tion between the actual and forecasted fi gures exceeds 20%, trade in the
direction of the deviation.
L et’ s use the U.S. NFP as an example. If forecasted fi gures are
300K, a 20% deviation is 60K. This means we can long the U.S. dollar
if NFP numbers come in above 360K, or we can short the U.S. dollar if
NFP numbers come in below 240K. Specifi cally, going long on the
U.S. dollar means going long on USD/JPY or going short on EUR/USD.
Similarly, going short on the U.S. dollar means going short on USD/JPY
or going long on EUR/USD.
There are two special cases for the Rule of 20: PMI and interest rates.
For PMI, the deviation between the actual and forecasted fi gures must
exceed 50 basis points (0.5%) before a trade can be taken. For interest
rates, the deviation between the actual and forecasted fi gures must exceed
20 basis points (0.2%) before a trade can be taken.
L et’ s look at how the Rule of 20 is applied to two strategies, gawk the
talk and balk the talk.

STRATEGY 5: GAWK THE TALK
Time Frame
G awk the talk works with the 15-minute (M15) or 30-minute (M30) candle.
This means that each candle on the chart represents 15 minutes or 30 min-
utes of price movement.
Indicators
No indicators are used for this strategy.
Currency Pairs
The gawk the talk strategy is suitable for all currency pairs listed on the
broker ’s platform, especially the seven major currency pairs of:
EUR/USD
USD/JPY
GBP/USD
USD/CHF
USD/CAD
AUD/USD
NZD/USD
Strategy Concept
W e use either the M15 or M30 charts to determine our entries because the
news is usually released in 15-minute intervals. Examples include 8 A.M.,
9:15 A.M., 10:30 P.M., and 11:45 P.M.
As discussed in the Rule of 20, trades are taken by comparing the fore-
casted fi gures with the actual fi gures. For this strategy, we go long on the
affected currency when actual fi gures are greater than forecasted fi gures
by a minimum factor of 20%. Since we trade in currency pairs, we focus on
pairs which feature the U.S. dollar in either the base currency or counter
currency.
A s an example, if the news is a positive interest rate announcement by
the Reserve Bank of Australia, we will take a long trade on the AUD/USD.
If the news is a positive retail sales announcement by Switzerland, we take
a short trade on the USD/CHF.

What about news announcements by the United States?
F or news that affects the United States directly, it is best for us to trade
the two most liquid pairs: EUR/USD and USD/JPY.
I n summary, if the affected currency is the base currency, we go long
on the currency pair. If the affected currency is the counter currency, we
go short.
Long Trade Setup
W e use the Australian employment data on the M15 time frame for illustrat-
ing a long trade. Here are the steps to execute the gawk the talk strategy
for long:
1. I dentify the currency to trade the news (AUD employment change).
2. E nter long on AUD/USD once the actual fi gure released is higher than
the forecasted fi gure by 20% or more. (See Figure 7.15 .)
3. S et a stop loss of 20 pips from the entry price.
4. S et a profi t target of 40 pips from the entry price. (See Figure 7.16 .)
From the long example in Figure 7.17 :
Entry price = 1.0303
Stop loss = 1.0283
Profit target = 1.0343
The risk for this trade is 20 pips, and the reward is 40 pips. The risk to
reward ratio is 1:2, which yields a tidy 6% return if we take a 3% risk.

Short Trade Setup
We use the Swiss CPI to illustrate a short trade. Here are the steps to
execute the gawk the talk strategy for short:
1. I dentify the currency to trade for the news (CHF CPI month on
month [m/m]).
2. E nter short on USD/CHF once the actual fi gure released is higher than
the forecasted fi gure by 20% or more. (See Figure 7.18 .)
3. S et a stop loss of 20 pips from the entry price.
4. S et a profi t target of 40 pips from the entry price. (See Figure 7.19 .)
From the short example in Figure 7.20 :
Entry price = 0.9167
Stop loss = 0.9147
Profit target = 0.9107
The risk for this trade is 20 pips, and the reward is 40 pips. The risk to
reward ratio is 1:2, which yields a tidy 6% return if we take a 3% risk.

STRATEGY 6: BALK THE TALK
Fear is a greater driving force than pleasure. Humans tend to react more
drastically in times of fear, or when they are presented with bad news. Fear
is also the emotion that drives traders around the world to watch every
single news announcement, for fear of missing out on key information.
Fear also results in sell-offs. Whenever there is bad news, the fi rst reac-
tion of traders is to sell. This is precisely why I mentioned in Chapter 5 that
trading the news is one of the best ways I know of making good profi ts in a
short time with bearable risk, especially since you can make a profi t from
either buying or selling.
Let ’s see how bad news can become profi table news for traders like
you and me.
Time Frame
Balk the talk works with the 15-minute (M15) or 30-minute (M30) candle.
This means that each candle on the chart represents 15 minutes or 30 minutes
of price movement.

As discussed in the Rule of 20, trades are taken by comparing the fore-
casted fi gures with the actual fi gures. For this strategy, we go short on the
affected currency when actual fi gures are lower than forecasted fi gures by
a minimum factor of 20%.
Since we trade in currency pairs, we focus on pairs which feature the
U.S. dollar in either the base currency or counter currency. As an example,
if the news is a negative GDP announcement by Canada, we take a long
trade on the USD/CAD.
I f the news is a negative employment announcement by the United
States, we take a long trade on EUR/USD or a short trade on USD/JPY.
Long Trade Setup
W e use the Canadian gross domestic product (GDP) on M30 time frame for
illustrating a long trade.
Here are the steps to execute the balk the talk strategy for long:
1. I dentify the currency to trade the news (CAD GDP m/m).

B efore taking a trade, it is important to note whether the affected
currency is in the base currency or counter currency. As an example, if
CHF is the affected currency, we look to go long on USD/CHF. If AUD is the

CHAPTER 8
Strategies for
Swing Traders
Y
ou are a swing trader primarily because you have a full-time job
and don’ t have much time to analyze the markets. That is why your
trading strategy is considered fairly midterm, with several trad-
ing opportunities in a week. Depending on the currency pair, the profi t
potential per trade for swing traders can range from 50 pips to 150 pips or
more. With trades having profi ts as high as the daily volatility, it is normal
for these trades to take more than a day to exit.
M ost swing trading strategies use indicators to pinpoint entries. This
chapter covers fi ve strategies suitable for all swing traders. The techniques
are developed for use on middle time frames, such as the hourly (H1) and
the 4-hourly (H4) charts.
D ue to the strategies’ time frame, swing traders are presented with
trading opportunities that most likely last more than a day but exit within
a week.
STRATEGY 7: TREND RIDER
Two of the most popular quotes in the forex market are the sentences
“The trend is your friend until it bends” and “Always trade along the trend.”
Each is good advice.
One of the main reasons why many retail traders fail to make consis-
tent income is because they exit too early. How often have we had that
experience when we jump into a trade, watch in delight as it goes our way,
take a 30 pip profi t with a smug grin, and then watch in horror as the trade
goes another 500 pips in our direction?
T he strategy discussed here will help traders of all levels, because it
essentially prevents us from exiting our trade too early. This is achieved by
155
cc0088..iinndddd 115555 0033//1122//1122 99::5555 AAMM

156 STRATEGIES TO WIN THE GAME
not setting a predetermined profi t target level but by employing a momen-
tum indicator called the average directional movement index (ADX) to tell
us when to exit the trade. I use this strategy often, because it only needs
little monitoring but the payoff potential is huge.
Time Frame
T he trend rider method works with the hourly (H1) or 4-hourly (H4) chart.
This means that each candle on the chart represents 1 hour or 4 hours of
price movement respectively.
Indicators
We use three indicators for this strategy:
1. E xponential moving average (EMA) with period 12 (EMA 12).
2. E MA with period 36 (EMA 36).
3. A verage Directional Movement Index with Meta Trader 4 default
setting (ADX 14). A level of 40 is added.
To understand the EMA, we fi rst defi ne the simple moving average (SMA).
Simple Moving Average An SMA is calculated by adding the closing
price of the candlestick over a given number of periods and dividing this
total sum by the number of periods. For example, SMA 12 is the sum of
closing prices for 12 candles divided by 12. The fi gures are dynamic, which
means that old data are dropped as new data are added. This rolling fi gure
causes the moving average to move along the time scale.
Exponential Moving Average T he EMA is similar to the SMA except
that more weight is given to recent prices. The formula for an EMA is:
Exponential Percentage = 2 / ( Time Period + 1 )
For EMA 12:
Exponential Percentage = 2 / ( 12 + 1 ) = 15 %
T his means that the most recent candle will be weighted 15% of the
value of the EMA. For SMA 12, each candle has a uniform weight of only
8.3% (100/12).
The advantage of using an EMA over the SMA is its ability to pick up
on price changes faster. I select EMA 12 because 12-hourly candles give
me half a day ’s worth of price action. EMA 36 is 36 hourly candles, giving
cc0088..iinndddd 115566 0033//1122//1122 99::5555 AAMM

Strategies for Swing Traders 157
me one and a half days’ worth of price action. Twelve 4-hourly candles
give me two days’ worth of price action, and 36 4-hourly candles give me
6 days’ worth of price action on the 4-hourly chart.
T he combination of EMA 12 and EMA 36 on either the hourly or
4-hourly time frame is important to give me a feel of the market over this
time period.
Average Directional Movement Index The ADX indicator is used to
measure the strength of a trend. It is plotted as a line with values ranging
from 0 to 100.
A low reading indicates a weak trend while a high reading depicts a
strong trend. The ADX is non-directional, which means it registers trend
strength in both uptrends and downtrends. I select the level 40 as a guide
to tell me when momentum of the trend is losing steam. The default
setting is period 14, and this is the same setting we will use for the trend
rider strategy.
Currency Pairs
The strategy is suitable for all currency pairs listed on the broker ’s plat-
form, especially the seven major currency pairs of:
EUR/USD
USD/JPY
GBP/USD
USD/CHF
USD/CAD
AUD/USD
NZD/USD
Strategy Concept
T he strategy uses moving average cross-over to detect an early change
in momentum. Specifi cally, we get a signal to go long when the EMA 12
crosses above the EMA 36. Similarly, we get a signal to go short when the
EMA 12 crosses below the EMA 36. The ADX indicator helps us to gauge
the strength of the momentum. We set the 40 level as a benchmark, as any
value above 40 indicates that momentum is very strong. Once the ADX
crosses above 40 and comes back below, it is telling us that the momentum
is losing steam and it ’s time to exit the trade. (See Figure 8.1 .)

toolbox because there is no predetermined profi t target.
cc0088..iinndddd 116622 0033//1122//1122 99::5555 AAMM

Strategies for Swing Traders 163
One of the biggest reasons why retail traders fail to make good money
in the forex market is because they exit too early, especially when the
ongoing trade is registering a small profi t. The use of the ADX indicator
in this strategy prevents us from exiting a trade prematurely. Instead,
it keeps us with the trend for the long haul. This is how big profi ts are
generated.
Trend following is statistically valid in the sense that every successful
trader vouches for it. Additionally, because of the highly favorable risk to
reward ratio of trend following strategies, one good trade can more than
compensate for the losses incurred during a bad patch. Again, the key to
successful trend trading is not to cut your profi ts short.
STRATEGY 8: TREND BOUNCER
The trigger of a trend can be anything from a political decision, to a
central bank policy announcement, to the discovery of new resources, to
a myriad of other possibilities. Trends move like waves in that they ebb
and fl ow.
I n an uptrend, you will fi nd that, at a certain point in time, prices
will pull back or retrace before continuing with the upward movement.
Similarly for a downtrend, prices will retrace upward against the down-
ward momentum before continuing their way down again.
This ebb-and-fl ow movement frustrates many trend traders, because
these retracements often stop out their trades while the market moves in
their direction again later.
E xperienced trend traders usually wait for the retracement to
happen before taking a trade in the direction of the trend. This is how
the trend bouncer strategy came about. The Bollinger Bands indicator
provides an objective way of identifying the ebb-and-fl ow movement of
a trend.
S ince this is a trend strategy, we have more than one profi t target.
In fact, we have three specifi c profi t levels for this strategy. The strategy
differs slightly from the trend rider in that there are specifi c levels for trend
bouncer traders to exit with profi ts.
Time Frame
T he trend bouncer method works with the hourly (H1) or 4-hourly (H4)
chart. This means that each candle on the chart represents 1 hour or
4 hours of price movement respectively.

Indicators
We use these indicators for this strategy:
1. B ollinger Bands (moving average [MA] 12, deviation [Dev] 2)
2. B ollinger Bands (MA 12, Dev 4)
Bollinger Band
Refer to the piranha strategy in Chapter 5 for an explanation on the
Bollinger Bands indicator.
Currency Pairs
This strategy is suitable for all currency pairs listed on the broker ’s
platform, especially the seven major currency pairs of:
EUR/USD
USD/JPY
GBP/USD
USD/CHF
USD/CAD
AUD/USD
NZD/USD
Strategy Concept
W ith the help of the Bollinger Bands, we can objectively identify the
ebb-and-fl ow movement of a trend. When the candlestick hits the upper
band of Bollinger Bands (MA 12, Dev 2), it indicates an upward momen-
tum, and we prepare to go long. As prices retrace back to the MA 12
(the center line of the Bollinger Bands), a signifi cant retracement has
occurred, and it is a good time to enter for a long trade.
When the candlestick hits the lower band of the Bollinger Bands
(MA 12, Dev 2), it indicates a downward momentum, and we prepare to go
short. As prices retrace back to the MA12 (the center line of the Bollinger
Bands), a signifi cant retracement has occurred, and it is a good time to
enter for a short trade. This trend strategy exits at three different targets.
Long Trade Setup
We use the GBP/USD on the H4 time frame to illustrate a long trade. Here
are the steps to execute the trend bouncer strategy for long:
1. W ait for the price to hit the upper band of the fi rst Bollinger Bands (MA
12, Dev 2) and retrace back down to the center MA 12. (See Figure 8 .10. )
cc0088..iinndddd 116644 0033//1122//1122 99::5555 AAMM

2. W hen the price touches MA 12, enter for a long. (See Figure 8.11 .)
3. T he stop loss is the lower band of the second Bollinger Bands (MA 12,
Dev 4). (See Figure 8.12 .)
4. T he trade will have three profi t targets with risk to reward ratios of
1:1, 1:2, and 1:3 respectively. (See Figure 8.13 .)

The risk for this trade is 90 pips, and the reward is 270 pips if all three
targets are hit. The risk to reward ratio is 1:3, which yields a tidy 9% return
if we take a 3% risk.
Short Trade Setup
W e use the NZD/USD on H1 time frame to illustrate a short trade. Here are
the steps to execute the trend bouncer strategy for short:
1. W ait for the price to hit the lower band of the fi rst Bollinger Bands (MA
12, Dev 2) and retrace back up to the center MA 12. (See Figure 8.14 .)
2. W hen the price touches MA 12, go for a short. (See Figure 8.15 .)
3. T he stop loss is the upper band of the second Bollinger Bands (MA 12,
Dev 4). (See Figure 8.16 .)
4. T he trade will have three profi t targets with risk to reward ratios of 1:1,
1:2, and 1:3 respectively. (See Figure 8.17 .)
From the short example in Figure 8.17 :
Entry price = 0.8214
Stop loss = 0.8260
Profit target 1 = 0.8168
Profit target 2 = 0.8122
Profit target 3 = 0.8076

Strategy Roundup
Understanding how trends move in ebbs and fl ows allow traders like you
and me to identify the direction and timing of our entries. We enter during
the “ebb” and let the “fl ow” ride us to our profi t targets.
U nlike the trend rider strategy, the trend bouncer strategy has three
predetermined profi t targets. Traders who like to bank in profi ts in various
stages prefer this strategy. The strategy is rooted in trend trading. With a
momentum indicator like the Bollinger Bands, you will greatly increase
your odds at being profi table in the long run.
Remember that smart money typically follows the trend. This strategy
helps us to hop on board early when we identify the trend.
STRATEGY 9: FIFTH ELEMENT
“ I am using a wonderful strategy, but I have to constantly monitor the mar-
ket in order not to miss a trade.” “Ah! I missed a trade again.” “According
to my strategy, it looks like there may be a trade setup soon, but I have a
movie date in the next hour. What should I do?”
Do these scenarios sound familiar to you?
Wouldn ’t it be nice to have a strategy that actually prompts you when
momentum of the market has switched to a new trend? In fact, the beauty

of the fi fth element strategy is that it tells you ahead of time when the entry
price will be.
This is the third and fi nal trend strategy in this segment. Let ’s fi nd out
what ’s so special about it.
Time Frame
The fi fth element strategy works with the hourly (H1) or 4-hourly (H4)
chart. This means that each candle on the chart represents 1 hour or
4 hours of price movement respectively.
Indicators
We use this indicator for this strategy:
M oving average convergence divergence (MACD) with default settings:
a. F ast EMA: 12
b. Slow EMA: 26
c. M ACD SMA: 9
d. Apply to close.
The moving average was created by Gerald Appel in 1979. Today the
MACD is one of the most popular indicators used by forex traders world-
wide. The indicator calculates and displays the difference between the two
EMAs at any time.
Since we are using the default setting, this difference is based on the
EMA 12 and the EMA 26. As the market moves, the two moving averages
move in tandem, widening (diverging) when the market is trending and
tightening (converging) when the market is slowing down.
There are three important elements of the MACD indicator:
1. M ACD line. This is the difference between the EMA 12 and the
EMA 26.
2. S ignal. This is the 9-day SMA of the MACD line.
3. H istogram. This is the difference between the MACD line and the
signal.
It is important to recognize that the histogram is a derivative of the
price and not the price itself. The histogram is positive when the MACD line
is above its SMA 9 and negative when the MACD line is below its SMA 9.
cc0088..iinndddd 117700 0033//1122//1122 99::5555 AAMM

Strategies for Swing Traders 171
When prices rise, the histogram bar becomes longer as the speed of the
price movement accelerates; the bar contracts as price movement deceler-
ates. The same principle applies when prices are falling, but the histogram
bars form at the bottom.
Up until now, I have described the traditional MACD. In the fi fth
element strategy, we use the Meta Trader 4 MACD. The difference between
the traditional MACD and the Meta Trader 4 MACD is in the histogram.
The traditional MACD ’s histogram represents the difference between the
MACD line and signal. The Meta Trader 4 MACD ’s histogram however, rep-
resents only the MACD line, which is the difference between the EMA 12
and EMA 26.
The histogram is important to help us identify possible shifts in momen-
tum and acts as a confi rmation of the momentum. This is the main essence
of the fi fth element.
Currency Pairs
This strategy is suitable for all currency pairs listed on the broker ’s
platform, especially the seven major currency pairs of:
EUR/USD
USD/JPY
GBP/USD
USD/CHF
USD/CAD
AUD/USD
NZD/USD
Strategy Concept
The MACD histogram indicates the direction and momentum of the mar-
ket. When the MACD histogram switches from negative to positive, this
indicates a possible upward shift in momentum. We wait for fi ve positive
bars on the histogram to confi rm the momentum before entering a long
trade on the fi fth bar. No prizes for guessing why the name of this strategy
is called the fi fth element!
W hen the MACD histogram switches from positive to negative,
this indicates a possible downward shift in momentum. We wait for fi ve
negative bars of the histogram to confi rm the momentum before entering a
short trade on the fi fth bar.

Long Trade Setup
W e use the AUD/USD on the H4 time frame to illustrate a long trade. Here
are the steps to execute the fi fth element strategy for long:
1. W ait for the MACD histogram to go from negative (<0) to positive (>0).
(See Figure 8.18 .)
2. W ait for four positive bars to form on the histogram before going long
on the opening candle of the fi fth histogram. (See Figure 8.19 .)
3. S et the stop loss at the last low of the histogram.
4. T he trade will have two profi t targets with risk to reward ratios of 1:1
and 1:2 respectively. (See Figure 8.20 .)
From the long example in Figure 8.21 :
Entry price = 1.0300
Stop loss = 1.0150
Profit target 1 = 1.0450
Profit target 2 = 1.0600
The risk for this trade is 150 pips, and the reward is 300 pips if both
targets are hit. The risk to reward ratio is 1:2, which yields a tidy 6% return
if we take a 3% risk.

Strategy Roundup
The fi fth element is an excellent swing trading strategy for beginners. The
beauty of this strategy is that it does not require you to monitor the market
for a long time. It also signals you well in advance as to when the entry of a
trade is about to take place. As you know by now, the entry takes place on
the fi fth bar after the MACD histogram switches from negative to positive
or from positive to negative.
Five bars of the histogram is equivalent to 5 hours on the H1 time frame
or 20 hours on the H4 time frame. This means you need to monitor the
market only on a 5-hourly basis if you are trading the H1 time frame or
a 20-hourly basis if you are trading the H4 time frame. Knowing that the
entry is always on the fi fth bar of the histogram means that you are in total
control of your time.
As an example, let ’s say that you are trading the H1 time frame. You
spot the MACD histogram switching from negative to positive. You glance
at your watch and see that the time is 2:15 P.M.
T he current bar is the fi rst bar, and it corresponds to the 2 P.M. candle.
What would be the likely time that you will enter the trade? The answer is
cc0088..iinndddd 117766 0033//1122//1122 99::5555 AAMM

Strategies for Swing Traders 177
6 P.M., because that would be the start of the candle that corresponds to the
fi fth bar of the histogram. You have ample time to catch a two-hour movie
before heading home again to prepare for the trade!
STRATEGY 10: POWER RANGER
T he forex market either trends or ranges. The last three strategies were dedi-
cated to trading the trend. The next two strategies are used to trade the range.
Range strategies are based either on pure price action or on indicators,
or using a combination of both. Oscillators are a class of indicators that are
commonly used in range strategies, because the oscillator indicates a pos-
sible range that the price swings back and forth from.
S ome common oscillators are the stochastic and the relative strength
index (RSI). As a trader and coach, I have found that identifying ranges
poses more challenges to traders than identifying trends. After all, a range
looks obvious to us only after it is formed.
To make matters worse, when a range is clearly formed and we are
using a range strategy, price action soars and causes the market to break
out of a range again. Hence, identifying the range while it is still forming
offers a huge advantage to traders.
T he power ranger strategy serves to fi ll this gap. Let us take a look at
how this is done through the use of a powerful oscillator.
Time Frame
The power ranger method works with the hourly (H1) or 4-hourly (H4)
chart. This means that each candle on the chart represents 1 hour or 4 hours
of price movement respectively.
Indicators
We use the stochastic indicator for this strategy with these settings:
%K period = 10
%D period = 3
Slowing = 3
Price field = High/Low
MA method = Simple
Levels 20 and 80
cc0088..iinndddd 117777 0033//1122//1122 99::5555 AAMM

178 STRATEGIES TO WIN THE GAME
Formula
% K = 100 [ ( C − L10 ) / ( H10 − L10 ) ]
Where:
C = most recent closing price
L10 = low of the last 10 periods
H10 = high of the last 10 periods
%D = 3-period moving average of %K
Stochastic Indicator S tochastic is an oscillator that measures over-
bought and oversold conditions in the market.
How to Apply Stochastic Stochastic tells us when the market is
overbought or oversold. When the stochastic lines are above 80, the mar-
ket is overbought. When the stochastic lines are below 20, the market is
oversold. As a general rule of thumb, oversold gives us a buy signal, and
overbought gives us a sell signal.
L ooking at the chart in Figure 8 .26, you can see that the stochastic
has been showing overbought and oversold conditions respectively. Based
on this information, because the market was overbought for such a long
period of time, we expect the price to go down soon.

T hat is the basics of the stochastic. Many traders use the stochastic in
different ways, but the main purpose of the indicator is to show us where
the market is overbought and oversold.
Currency Pairs
This strategy is suitable for all currency pairs listed on the broker ’s
platform, especially the seven major currency pairs of:
EUR/USD
USD/JPY
GBP/USD
USD/CHF
USD/CAD
AUD/USD
NZD/USD
Strategy Concept
T he power ranger strategy is based on the concept that a range will form
after the market fi nishes trending. We use the stochastic to give us an indi-
cation of a possible range formation. We also rely on the current market
momentum to tell us when to go long or short. If the market is moving in
an uptrend, we look to go long in the range. The entry is determined by the
oversold region (below level 20) of the stochastic.
If the market is moving in a downtrend, we look to go short in the
range. The entry is determined by the overbought region (above level 80)
of the stochastic. We use the most recent high and low to determine the
possible resistance and support of the range.
T his strategy has two profi t targets, and we take the fi rst profi t target
within the range. The second profi t target is located beyond the range in
anticipation of a breakout opportunity.
Long Trade Setup
We use EUR/USD on the H1 time frame to illustrate a long trade. Here are
the steps to execute the power ranger strategy for long:
1. D raw an uptrend line based on a series of higher highs and higher
lows. (See Figure 8.27 .)
2. O n the stochastic, look for %K and %D to go below level 20 (oversold).
(See Figure 8.28 .)

Strategy Roundup
T his is an awesome range strategy as it allows us to take a range trade in
the early stages of formation. The bonus is that it also allows us to take
advantage of a second profi t target in the event prices break out of a range
and move into an early trend.
It doesn ’t mean that you should go long whenever the stochastic
is at the oversold region or go short whenever the stochastic is at the
overbought region. If you do so, you may end up selling on an uptrend
or buying on a downtrend. Going against momentum in this way can
be risky.
A lways determine the momentum of the market fi rst before deciding
whether to look for the overbought or oversold region of the stochastic.
In an uptrend, look for the oversold region. In a downtrend, look for the
overbought region. In this way, you will be trading along with the market
momentum and putting yourself in an advantageous position.
Determining the momentum of the market fi rst prevents us from
blindly trading the signal given by the stochastic.

STRATEGY 11: THE PENDULUM
I n the previous strategy, we explored a technique that helps us to antici-
pate a range with the help of the stochastic indicator and also trade it in
the early stages of formation. The pendulum strategy comes to the rescue
in the later stages of a range formation. In other words, we can still trade
the range after it has been formed.
You don ’t need any indicators for this strategy, and you can use it to
trade a range for as long as the market is swinging back and forth within
the range like a pendulum.
Time Frame
T he pendulum method works with the hourly (H1) or 4-hourly (H4) chart.
This means that each candle on the chart represents 1 hour or 4 hours of
price movement respectively.
Indicators
No indicators are used for this strategy.
Currency Pairs
This strategy is suitable for all currency pairs listed on the broker ’s
platform, especially the seven major currency pairs of:
EUR/USD
USD/JPY
GBP/USD
USD/CHF
USD/CAD
AUD/USD
NZD/USD
Strategy Concept
The pendulum in motion swings back and forth because the force of
gravity is pulling it back to the vertical position every time it swings away
from it. The pendulum reaches an optimal height before it starts to fall
back. However, if the swinging force is too great, the string holding the
pendulum will snap, and the pendulum will fl y off.
cc0088..iinndddd 118855 0033//1122//1122 99::5555 AAMM

186 STRATEGIES TO WIN THE GAME
T he ranging market acts in a similar fashion to the pendulum. Every
time prices pull away from the midpoint of the range toward the support
or resistance, market forces will pull it back towards the mid-point of the
range. However, when the market gathers enough momentum, prices will
break the support or resistance of the range and move into a trend.
I n this strategy, we wait for the pendulum to reach its optimal height
and fall before we enter the trade. We do this by executing a trade only at
the 10% mark after prices turn back from either support or resistance. The
fi rst target is set at the 50% mark of the range, and the second target is set
at the 90% mark of the range.
Long Trade Setup
W e use the AUD/USD on the H4 time frame to illustrate a long trade. Here
are the steps to execute the pendulum strategy for long:
1. I dentify the resistance and support. Take note when the price goes
back to the support again. (See Figure 8.35 .)
2. I n this example, the range is 269 pips; 10% of the range is 27 pips.
Enter when the price bounces 27 pips above the support (1.0101).
(See Figure 8.36 .)
3. T he fi rst and second profi t targets are 50% and 90% of the range respec-
tively, which are 135 pips and 243 pips above the support (1.0101).
4. U se risk to reward ratio of 1:1 to set the stop loss. (See Figure 8.37 .)

Strategy Roundup
This strategy is applicable as long as the market is swinging back and forth
in a range. The power ranger strategy and the pendulum strategy work per-
fectly together. You can use the power ranger strategy to identify and trade
the range in its early stage of formation, then apply the pendulum strategy
to trade the later portion of the range.

CHAPTER 9
Strategies for
Position Traders
T
hree characteristics defi ne you as a position trader:
1. Y ou have a deep understanding of market fundamentals.
2. Y ou are not concerned with the short-term and medium-term move-
ments of the currency market.
3. Y ou have a sizable account to trade with. This is necessary to support
your long-term outlook and withstand possible large fl oating losses
should the trade go against you for an extended period of time.
Two advantages come into play for position traders. The fi rst point is
that interest can be earned. This is because interest or swap is paid on
the currency that is borrowed and earned on the one that is bought. This
amount can be signifi cant when trades are held for long periods of time.
S econdly, correlations between other fi nancial instruments can be
brought into play. In the fi nancial world, capital fl ows in a fairly predict-
able manner. Position traders who have a great feel for the market can use
their knowledge to predict how other markets will correlate to the fl ow of
money in the forex market.
A great example is the commodity market. When risk is on, commod-
ity currencies, such as the Australian dollar, the New Zealand dollar, and
the Canadian dollar, tend to do well. Over time, the strengthening of these
3 currencies also translate into higher prices for the actual commodities
involved. Examples include gold and oil.
T his chapter explores three strategies with time frames of either the
daily or weekly charts. The two aspects of position trading—swap and
commodity correlation—are also explored to allow position traders to
achieve maximum gains across several asset classes.

192 STRATEGIES TO WIN THE GAME
STRATEGY 12: SWAP AND FLY
Every forex transaction involves the borrowing of one currency to buy
another. This transaction also forms the basis of why traders can go long
or short at any time.
A s an example, if you are buying a currency with a higher interest rate
than the one you are borrowing, the net interest rate differential will be
positive, and you earn interest for every day that the trade remains open.
Conversely, if the interest rate differential is negative, you will have to pay
interest for every day that the trade remains open. You may know this as
the carry trade.
Five P.M. in New York is considered the beginning and end of the
forex trading day. Hence, any trading positions that are open beyond
5 P.M. are considered to be held overnight—or rolled over—and are sub-
ject to swap rates. The forex market is closed on Saturdays and Sundays,
so no swap rate is incurred or earned over the weekend. However, most
liquidity providers still apply the swap rules over the weekend.
T o balance the effect of non-trading activities over the weekend, the
forex market books three days of swap on Wednesday. Hence, if you hold
a trade over 5 P.M. on a Wednesday evening, you will either incur or earn
three times the normal rates.
T he swap and fl y strategy is a slow but steady technique that helps you
to accumulate interest every day. You can even come out with a positive
return after a period of time, even though the trade exits at breakeven.
Figures 9.1 and 9.2 show how you can track which currency pairs
give positive swap when you execute a long or short position in the cur-
rency market. Do note, however, that fi gures may be different for different
brokers.

Time Frame
The swap and fl y method works with the daily candle (D1) and weekly
candle (W1). This means that each candle on the chart represents 1 day or
1 week of price movement.
Indicators
No indicators are used for this strategy.
Currency Pairs
T his strategy is suitable for all currency pairs listed on the broker’ s plat-
form that have positive swaps for either long or short positions.
Strategy Concept
The main aim of this strategy is to earn as much interest as we can. Hence
the fi rst step is to fi nd out which currency pairs on the broker’ s platform
offer the highest swap rates for both long and short positions.
If a positive swap is given on a long position, we look for a suitable long
entry on the chart. If a positive swap is given on a short position, we look
for a suitable short entry on the chart.
The next milestone is to shift the stop loss dynamically to the entry
price, also known as the break-even price. This step is done when the mar-
ket moves favorably in our direction. After a period of time, even if our
“new” stop-loss level is hit, the trade is exited with a profi t because of the
swap earned.

This strategy can be used in conjunction with any other high-time
frame strategies. To illustrate the effect of this strategy, I am going to use
common candlestick patterns, such as three white soldiers and three black
crows, to illustrate a long and a short trade.
T hree white soldiers is a bullish candlestick pattern consisting of three
consecutive bull candles. Three black crows is a bearish candlestick pat-
tern consisting of three consecutive bear candles.
Long Trade Setup
W e use the AUD/JPY on the daily time frame to illustrate the long setup.
Here are the steps to execute the swap and fl y strategy for long:
1. I dentify a three white soldiers candlestick pattern. (See Figure 9.3 .)
2. E nter long at the opening of the next candle.
3. R eference a recent signifi cant low to set the stop loss. (See Figure 9.4 .)
4. O nce the market moves in your favor at a risk to reward ratio of 1:1,
shift your stop loss to the entry price. (See Figure 9.5 .)
5. T rade hits breakeven after 36 weeks (252 days). (See Figure 9.6 .)

1. I dentify a three black crows candlestick pattern. (See Figure 9.7 .)
2. E nter short at the opening of the next candle.
3. R eference a recent signifi cant high to set the stop loss. (See Figure 9 .8. )

We then allow the trade to remain open every day until the new stop loss is
hit. Doing this allows us to earn positive swap every day.
T raders can also choose to close this trade before it exits, provided
the risk to reward ratio is favorable. As an example, traders can choose to
exit the entire position totally if the risk to reward ratio yields a minimum
factor of 1:3.
For the long AUD/JPY trade, the stop loss was 570 pips. Hence, traders
could have chosen to exit the trade entirely if the AUD/JPY was at a mini-
mum of 1710 pips (570 × 3) above the entry price.
F or the short GBP/AUD trade, the stop loss was 725 pips. Hence, trad-
ers could have chosen to exit the trade entirely if the GBP/AUD was at a
minimum of 2175 pips (725 × 3) below the entry price.
STRATEGY 13: COMMODITY CORRELATION (PART 1 )
Oil is one of the world ’s basic necessities. Among other things, it is needed
to run factories, plants, machinery, ships, and cars. A decline in oil prices
is a nightmare for oil producers but a dream come true for oil consumers.
The reverse is also true, when oil prices hit record highs. In July 2008, oil
peaked at over USD147 a barrel. Those were the days when oil producers
were smiling and oil consumers were sweating.
C anada is a country that exports most of its oil. In fact, as one of the
world’ s top ten oil-producing nations, its economy is severely hit when oil
prices decline. Many traders today also utilize the price of oil to predict the
movement of the Canadian dollar.
W hen oil prices are high, the Canadian dollar tends to strengthen.
When oil prices are low, the Canadian dollar tends to weaken. Japan, in
contrast, is considered a net oil importer. This causes the Japanese yen to
weaken considerably when oil prices are high and vice versa.
M any traders ask me for a “magic” strategy to trade oil. However, I
don ’t particularly like to trade it because oil prices can be very volatile.
A n easier improvisation of trading oil directly would be to utilize
knowledge of oil prices to trade the CAD/JPY currency pair. As Canada is a
net oil exporter and Japan is a net oil importer, the price of oil becomes a
leading indicator for the movement of the CAD/JPY currency pair.
Time Frame
T he commodity correlation method works with the daily charts (D1).
This means that each candle on the chart represents 1 day of price
movement.

200 STRATEGIES TO WIN THE GAME
Indicators
W e use the average true range (ATR) indicator to set the stop loss for this
strategy.
Average True Range T he ATR is an indicator developed by J. Welles
Wilder to measure the volatility of the market. The true range is defi ned
as the largest value of the absolute difference between the:
1. C urrent high and current low
2. C urrent high and the previous close
3. C urrent low and the previous close
The ATR is an N-period exponential moving average of the true range.
For example, ATR 14 is a 14-period exponential moving average of the
true range.
A larger value of ATR indicates a higher volatility, and a smaller value
of ATR indicates a lower volatility. We will use the ATR as a guide to set our
stop losses and profi t targets.
Currency Pairs
T his strategy is used with CAD/JPY only, with the movement of oil prices
acting as a leading indicator.
Strategy Concept
T he price movement on the oil chart is used as a reference to trigger a
trade on the CAD/JPY. Technical levels of support and resistance on the oil
chart are used to spot long and short trades on CAD/JPY. If candles close
above resistance on the oil chart, a long trade is triggered on the CAD/JPY
the following day. Similarly, if candles close below support on the oil chart,
a short trade is triggered on the CAD/JPY the following day.
The risk to reward ratio is set as 1:3. A bigger target is employed to
allow the trade to run its course.
Long Trade Setup
Here are the steps to execute the commodity correlation strategy for long:
1. I dentify the resistance of the oil chart on the daily time frame.
2. I dentify a candle that closes above the resistance. (See Figure 9.11 .)

STRATEGY 13: COMMODITY CORRELATION (PART 2 )
The correlation coeffi cient is a number that describes the extent to which
two instruments are correlated to each other. The number oscillates
between –1 and +1.
C ommonly mistaken as a momentum oscillator, the correlation coef-
fi cient is instead a number that moves from periods of positive correlation
to periods of negative correlation. Located on one end of the spectrum, +1
is considered a state of perfect positive correlation between the two instru-
ments. If the number is anywhere between 0 and +1, the two instruments
move in the same direction but with varying degrees of positive correlation.
O n the other end of the spectrum, –1 is considered a state of perfect
negative correlation between the two instruments. If the number is any-
where between 0 and –1, the two instruments move in the opposite direc-
tion but with varying degrees of negative correlation.
F or much of 2011 and 2012, the correlation coeffi cient for gold and the
dollar index was between –0.6 and –0.8. This means that if the dollar index
was up, there was a 60% to 80% probability that gold prices would come down.
cc0099..iinndddd 220044 0066//1122//1122 22::2266 PPMM

Strategies for Position Traders 205
I n contrast, if the dollar index was down, there was a 60% to 80% prob-
ability that gold prices would go up.
Here we explore how to trade spot gold using the U.S. Dollar Index as
a reference. The U.S. Dollar Index is an exchange-traded index that repre-
sents the value of the U.S. dollar in terms of a basket of six major foreign
currencies. These are:
Euro (57.6%)
Japanese yen (13.6%)
UK pound (11.9%)
Canadian dollar (9.1%)
Swedish krona (4.2%)
Swiss franc (3.6%)
The price action of the dollar index gives us an idea of how the U.S.
economy is performing compared to other major world economies.
O n August 15, 1971, the United States unilaterally terminated the
Bretton Woods system of having the U.S. dollar pegged to gold at USD35 an
ounce. At the same time, the U.S. dollar became a reserve currency.
The U.S. Dollar Index was started in March 1973. Its beginning value
was 100.000.
H istorically, from 1967 until 2012, the Dollar Index averaged 98.51,
reaching a historical high of 164.72 in February 1985 and a low of 70.698 on
March 16, 2008, during the global fi nancial crisis.
Gold prices, however, have steadily been climbing. The end of 2011
marked the eleventh straight year of gold ’s spectacular bull run, hitting a
record high of USD1920 an ounce on September 16, 2011.
This strategy seeks to exploit the inverse relationship between the
Dollar Index and the price of gold. According to the World Gold Council,
“While holding all else equal, gold tends to rise when the US dollar falls.”
In November 2010, Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke announced
a second round of quantitative easing (QE2) by injecting USD600 billion
into the fi nancial system. The added supply of US dollars in the system
caused gold prices to hit record highs within a month.
I n September 2012, in a move widely touted as “QE3,” the Federal
Reserve said it would expand its holdings of long-term securities with
open-ended purchases of USD40 billion of mortgage debt a month. The
announcement caused the price of gold to hit a 7-month high. With central
banks worldwide taking unprecedented measures to ensure ample liquidity
in the global fi nancial system, the inverse relationship between the Dollar
Index and gold prices looks set to continue.
Let ’s see how this strategy works.

206 STRATEGIES TO WIN THE GAME
Time Frame
T he commodity correlation strategy works with the daily candle (D1). This
means that each candle on the chart represents 1 day of price movement.
Indicators
We use the ATR indicator.
Currency Pairs
U se spot gold or XAU/USD only, with the price action of the Dollar Index
as a leading indicator.
Strategy Concept
T he price action of the Dollar Index is used as a reference to trigger a trade
on the XAU/USD. Technical levels of support and resistance on the Dollar
Index chart are used to spot long and short trades on XAU/USD. If a candle
closes below support on the Dollar Index chart, a long trade is triggered on
the XAU/USD the following day. Similarly, if a candle closes above resis-
tance on the Dollar Index chart, a short trade is triggered on the XAU/USD
the following day.
The risk to reward ratio is set as 1:3. A bigger target is employed to
allow the trade to run its course.
Long Trade Setup
Here are the steps to execute the commodity correlation strategy for long:
1. I dentify the support of the Dollar Index chart on the daily time frame.
2. I dentify a candle that closes below the support. (See Figure 9.17 .)
3. E nter long on gold (XAU/USD) at the opening of the next day’ s candle.
4. S et the stop loss at twice the ATR as the previous candle, which is
2,664 pips (1,332 × 2).
5. S et the profi t target at a risk to reward ratio of 1:3. In this example, the
profi t target is 7,992 pips (2664 × 3). (See Figure 9.18 .)
From the short example in Figure 9.19 :
Entry price = 1291.23
Stop loss = 1264.59
Profit target = 1371.15

frame.
2. I dentify a candle that closes above the resistance. (See Figure 9.20 .)
3. E nter short on gold (XAU/USD) at the opening of the next day ’s

From the short example in Figure 9.22 :
Entry price = 1857.81
Stop loss = 1938.25
Profit target = 1616.49
T he risk for this trade is 8,044 pips, and the reward is 24,132 pips if the

Strategy Roundup
Part of the commodity correlation strategy seeks to take advantage of the
positive correlation between oil prices and the CAD/JPY currency pair.
Using oil prices as a reference, trades are triggered on the CAD/JPY. This
strategy is especially suited to traders who would like to trade oil but pre-
fer not to experience the volatility associated with it.

Part 2 of the commodity correlation strategy seeks to take advantage
of the negative correlation between the Dollar Index and gold prices.
Using the Dollar Index as a reference, trades are triggered on XAU/USD,
which is the price for spot gold on FXPRIMUS.
W ith the Federal Reserve announcing its plans to keep interest rates
low until the middle of 2015, the inverse relationship between the U.S. dol-
lar and gold prices looks set to remain. This strategy is ideal for gold trad-
ers all around the world because it provides an objective way to take an
entry for gold, using the Dollar Index as an important reference.
STRATEGY 14: SIAMESE TWINS
In late 2007, China overtook Japan to become Australia ’s largest trad-
ing partner. In 2009, China became Australia ’s largest export market,
consuming commodities such as iron ore, coal, gas, and wool in record
amounts.
According to Australia ’s department of Foreign Affairs and Trade,
Australia’ s total trade with China in 2010 was $105 billion, almost 24% more
than the previous year. It was the fi rst time that Australia ’s two-way trade
with a single nation topped the $100 billion level. Forty years ago, two-way
trade between China and Australia was less than $100 million.

F or this reason alone, Australia’ s economy tends to move in t andem
with China ’s economy. When China reports good numbers on the
Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), gross domestic product (GDP) or
the trade balance, Australia’ s currency tends to rise. Similarly, when
China reports disappointing fi gures, the Australian dollar tends to fall
as well.
T his strategy seeks to take advantage of the movement of the AUD/
USD by taking cue from China’ s reported fi gures and monetary policies. It
is especially useful since we are not able to freely trade the Chinese cur-
rency (yuan) yet.

The Siamese twins method works with the daily candle (D1). This means
that each candle on the chart represents 1 day of price movement.
Indicators
No indicators are used for this strategy.
Currency Pairs
This strategy is applicable only to AUD/USD.
Strategy Concept
When China announces good data, such as high GDP and high PMI num-
bers, the AUD tends to strengthen for two reasons.
1. C hina will start to import more raw materials from Australia. This
increase in business gives rise to a stronger AUD because China has to
pay for such materials in AUD.
2. G ood data from China tend to increase speculation on higher-yielding
currencies. This is because China is largely seen as a major global
player, and good numbers from China tend to have a knock-on effect on
the world economy. This positive effect on the global economy encour-
ages the appetite for risk, which in turn strengthens the AUD because
its interest rate remains one of the highest among the G20 nations.
We take a long position on AUD/USD immediately after China
announces better-than-expected data. Similarly, we take a short position on
AUD/USD immediately after China announces worse-than-expected data.

212 STRATEGIES TO WIN THE GAME
I call this strategy Siamese twins because the economies of China and
Australia are joined at the hip. When China does well, the Australian econ-
omy fl ourishes, and vice versa.
Long Trade Setup
Here are the steps to execute the Siamese twins strategy for long:
1. L ook for any major news from China. On November 30, 2010, we see
how China cut the banks’ reserve requirement ratio for the fi rst time in
three years. This frees up more cash, which encourages banks to lend.
The effect is seen as positive because it spurs economic growth in China.
2. G o long on AUD/USD immediately. (See Figure 9.23 .)
3. S et the stop loss below the previous low.
4. T he trade will have two profi t targets with a risk to reward ratio of 1:1
and 1:2 respectively. (See Figure 9.24 .)
From the long example in Figure 9.25 :
Entry price = 1.0000
Stop loss = 0.9600
Profit target 1 = 1.0400
Profit target 2 = 1.0800
China cuts bank reserve requirement ratio for the 1st time
in 3 years (30 Nov 2011)

Short Trade Setup
Here are the steps to execute the Siamese twins strategy for short:
1. L ook out for any major news from China. In this example, we see how
the actual number of China ’s HSBC fl ash manufacturing PMI is worse
than expected. The effect is seen as negative because it is viewed as a
contraction in China ’s economy.
2. G o short on AUD/USD immediately. (See Figure 9.26 .)
3. S et the stop loss above the previous high.
4. T he trade has two profi t targets with risk to reward ratios of 1:1 and 1:2
respectively. (See Figure 9.27 .)
From the long example in Figure 9.28 :
Entry price = 1.0458
Stop loss = 1.0638

Strategy Roundup
The Siamese twins strategy is perfect for position traders because
of the long time frame employed. When China announces news—either
good or bad—the subsequent effect on the Australian economy may take
weeks or even months to play out.
As we learned in the swap and fl y strategy, a long AUD/USD trade can
give you additional swap as well. This amount can be very signifi cant if the
trade is held for several months before it is exited.

CHAPTER 10
Strategies for
Mechanical Traders
A
s a mechanical trader, your main focus in trading the markets is not
time driven but system driven. Your trades are based on a fi xed rou-
tine, regardless of time frame and regardless of market activity.
T his style of trading is especially suited to newbies because strategy
execution is based purely on a set of fi xed steps or rules. Due to its non-
dependence on specifi c time frames, the three strategies discussed here
employ time frames that span three different categories: scalping, day trad-
ing, and position trading.
The fi rst strategy, the guppy burst, is based on the 5-minute (M5) chart.
The second strategy, English breakfast tea, is based on the 15-minute
(M15) chart. The third strategy, good morning Asia, is based on the daily
(D1) chart.
Many newbies love the fi xed routine by which mechanical trades are
set up. It is also the reason why many go on to develop automated trading
systems by coding the trading rules into software.
Let ’s have a look at all three strategies.
STRATEGY 15: GUPPY BURST
The fi rst step in developing a mechanical trading system is to understand
and describe market behavior. The next step is to fi gure out the rules for
entries and exits. The guppy burst seeks to exploit trading profi ts when the
market is quiet.
T here is a window of around three hours between the close of the
U.S. market and the opening of the Asian market. The forex market is
relatively quiet during this time and tends to move in a gentle yet predict-
able manner.

cc1100..iinndddd 221177 0033//1122//1122 99::5577 AAMM

218 STRATEGIES TO WIN THE GAME
T he market then springs to life again when the Asian market opens.
The guppy burst seeks to identify the trading range during this 3-hour win-
dow and anticipate a potential breakout of the trading range.
T o take full advantage of this potential breakout, I have selected one
of the most volatile crosses, the GBP/JPY, commonly known as the guppy
among forex traders.
Time Frame
The guppy burst method works with the 5-minute candle (M5). This means
that each candle represents 5 minutes of price movement.
Indicators
We use only pure price action; no indicators are used for this strategy.
Currency Pairs
The guppy burst method applies only to the GBP/JPY.
Strategy Concept
A fter the trading range is identifi ed, we place pending long and pending short
orders. The entry price for the pending long is at the resistance level while
the stop loss is located at the support level. The entry price for the pending
short is at the support level while the stop loss is at the resistance level.
The profi t target is set at twice the amount of the stop loss. As an exam-
ple, if the stop loss is 50 pips from the entry price, the profi t target will be
100 pips. This is a risk to reward ratio of 1:2.
Long Trade Setup
The reference candle for this strategy is the one that corresponds to 5 P.M.
New York time, which is the closing time of the U.S. market. This is the
00:00-hour candle on the FXPRIMUS platform.
Here are the steps to execute the guppy burst strategy for long:
1. I dentify the trading range in the fi rst three hours after the U.S. market
closes by referencing the highest high (resistance) and the lowest low
(support) in these three hours. (See Figure 10.1 .)
2. P lace a pending buy stop order with entry price at the highest high
(resistance).

3. S et the stop loss at the lowest low (support). (See Figure 10.2 .)
4. M easure the number of pips between the EP and SL. The profi t tar-
get is double that number of pips. In this example, the number of pips
between EP (128.16) and SL (127.86) is 30, so the TP will be 60 pips
above the EP at 128.76. (See Figure 10.3 .)

Short Trade Setup
The reference candle for this strategy is the one that corresponds to 5 P.M.
New York time, which is the closing time of the U.S. market. This is the
00:00-hour candle on the FXPRIMUS platform.
Here are the steps to execute the guppy burst strategy for short:
1. I dentify the trading range in the fi rst three hours after the U.S. market
closes by referencing the highest high (resistance) and the lowest low
(support) in these three hours. (See Figure 10.5 .)
2. P lace a pending sell stop order with entry price at the lowest low
(support).
3. S et the stop loss at the highest high (resistance). (See Figure 10.6 .)
4. M easure the number of pips between the EP and SL. The profi t tar-
get is double that number of pips. In this example, the number of
pips between EP (128.12) and SL (128.33) is 21, so the TP will be
42 pips below the EP at 127.70. (See Figure 10.7 .)
From the short example in Figure 10.8 :
Entry price 5 128.12
Stop loss 5 128.33
Profit target 5 127.70
The risk for this trade is 21 pips, and the reward is 42 pips. The risk to
reward ratio is 1:2, which yields a tidy 6% return if we take a 3% risk.

Strategy Roundup
A s there is no way to anticipate when the market will reach the entry price,
the best option is to create one pending long order and one pending short
order after you have identifi ed the trading range of the three-hour window.
Once either of the pending orders is triggered, delete the other pend-
ing order immediately. As an example, if the pending long order gets

triggered fi rst, delete the pending short order. If the pending short order
gets triggered fi rst, delete the pending long order.
This strategy is suitable for traders who are available during a specifi c
time of the day to execute the trade during the three-hour gap.
STRATEGY 16: ENGLISH BREAKFAST TEA
W hen traders trade a particular currency pair for a long period of time,
they may start to observe certain characteristics or behaviors of that cur-
rency pair. These characteristics or behaviors could happen during market
opening hours, market closing hours, major news releases, Christmas and
New Year holidays, fi nancial year closings, and so on.
I n my years of trading, I have noticed peculiar behaviors in various cur-
rency pairs. In this strategy, I share one of my observations about the GBP/
USD during the London opening hours.
Time Frame
The English breakfast tea method works with the 15-minute candle (M15).
This means that each candle represents 15 minutes of price movement.
Indicators
We use pure price action, and no indicators are used for this strategy.
cc1100..iinndddd 222233 0033//1122//1122 99::5577 AAMM

224 STRATEGIES TO WIN THE GAME
Currency Pair
This strategy is applied to the GBP/USD only.
Strategy Concept
T he English breakfast tea strategy is based on an observation I’ ve had on
the GBP/USD for a while now. This occurs before and after the London
market opens in the morning.
Here ’s what I discovered: When the GBP/USD trends in one direction
from 04:15 hours to 08:30 hours London time, it has a tendency to move in
the other direction after 08:30 hours.
H ence, we fi rst compare the closing price of the 15-minute (M15) can-
dle that corresponds to 04:15 hours and 08:15 hours London time to deter-
mine the direction of the GBP/USD. We then enter a trade in the opposite
direction at 08:30 hours London time.
A s an example, if the closing price of the M15 candle at 08:15 hours is
lower than the closing price at 04:15 hours, we go long at 08:30 hours. If
the closing price of the M15 candle at 08:15 hours is higher than the closing
price at 04:15 hours, we go short at 08:30 hours.
T he stop loss is fi xed at 30 pips, and there are three profi t targets for
this strategy with risk to reward ratios of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3. In other words,
the profi t targets are 30 pips, 60 pips, and 90 pips respectively.
Long Trade Setup
T he 10:30-hour candle of the charts on FXPRIMUS platform is used to illus-
trate this strategy because it corresponds to London time 08:30 hours.
Here are the steps to execute the English breakfast tea for long:
1. T he closing price of the M15 candle at 10:15 hours must be lower than
the closing price at 06:15. (See Figure 10.9 .)
2. E nter at the opening of the candle at 10:30 hours. This is the entry
price.
3. S et the stop loss at 30 pips below the entry price.
4. T here are three profi t targets at 30 pips, 60 pips, and 90 pips above the
EP respectively. (See Figure 10.10 .)
From the long example in Figure 10.11 :
Entry price 5 1.5900
Stop loss 5 1.5870
Profit target 1 5 1.5930
cc1100..iinndddd 222244 0033//1122//1122 99::5577 AAMM

Profit target 2 5 1.5960
Profit target 3 5 1.5990
The risk for this trade is 30 pips, and the reward is 90 pips if all three
t argets are hit. The risk to reward ratio is 1:3, which yields a tidy 9% return
if we take a 3% risk.

long or short is the fi rst step that new traders normally get confused on
when they begin discretionary trading.
W ith its clear-cut rules and mechanical execution, the English b reakfast
tea method eliminates the guesswork in terms of strategy direction.
STRATEGY 17: GOOD MORNING ASIA
A fair number of traders prefer to trade the U.S. and Europe sessions of the
forex market because they feel that the market tends to be more exciting
at those times. These traders consider the Asian session boring and quiet
most of the time.
H owever, many part-time retail traders who are based in the
United States and Europe miss out trading opportunities in the U.S.
and Europe sessions because of work or business commitments. The
only time they can trade happens to fall within the perceived boring
and quiet Asia session.
T hankfully, now we all know that the forex market is open 24 hours a
day. When there are trade-related activities, there are opportunities.
My last strategy of this book is traded on the early-morning Asian
hours. This time period can provide numerous opportunities for traders
located in different time zones across the world, whether they are part time
or full time. I hope that it will greet you like the bright morning sun.
cc1100..iinndddd 222288 0033//1122//1122 99::5577 AAMM

Strategies for Mechanical Traders 229
Time Frame
T he good morning Asia strategy works with the daily candle (D1). This
means that each candle represents 1 day of price movement.
Indicators
We use only pure price action, and no indicators are used for this strategy.
Currency Pairs
This strategy applies only to the USD/JPY.
Strategy Concept
O pening hours of the Asian market begin after the U.S. market closes. The
direction of the Asian market tends to take its cue from the previous day ’s
performance on the U.S. market because the U.S. market is the largest
economy in the world.
If the U.S. market closes with a bullish sentiment, the Asian market
usually starts the day bullish. If the U.S. market closes with a bearish senti-
ment, the Asian market usually starts off bearish.
D uring the early-morning Asian hours, the best currency pair to take
advantage of this phenomenon is none other than the USD/JPY, as the
Japanese yen is the only Asian major currency.
T his strategy allows you to position yourself just before the opening of
the Asian market—hence the name good morning Asia.
T he entry time of this strategy is right after the U.S. market closes
at 5 P.M. If the previous daily candle is a bull candle, we ride along the
momentum to go long on Asia opening. If the previous daily candle is a
bear candle, we follow the bearish fl ow with a short on Asia opening.
We take the low or high of the previous candle as the stop loss. The
risk to reward for this strategy is 2:1. If the stop loss is 80 pips, the profi t
target is 40 pips.
Long Trade Setup
F or this strategy, the opening and closing of the daily candle corresponds
to 5 P.M. New York time, which is the closing time of the U.S. market.
Here are the steps to execute the good morning Asia strategy for long:
1. E nsure that the previous day’ s candle is a bull candle (i.e., the closing
price of the candle is higher than the opening price). (See Figure 1 0.15. )

4. M easure the number of pips between the entry price and stop loss. If
the number of pips is less than 30, shift the stop loss lower to make
sure it is at least 30 pips from the entry price. The profi t target is half
that number of pips. In this example, the number of pips between entry

price (78.42) and stop loss (77.36) is 106, so the profi t target is 53 pips
above the entry price at 78.95. (See Figure 10.16 .)
From the long example in Figure 10.17 :
Entry price 5 78.42
Stop loss 5 77.36
Profit target 5 78.95
The risk for this trade is 106 pips, and the reward is 53 pips. The risk to
reward ratio is 2:1, which yields a 1.5% return if we take a 3% risk.
Short Trade Setup
Here are the steps to execute the good morning Asia strategy for short:
1. E nsure that the previous day’ s candle is a bear candle (i.e., the closing
price of the candle is lower than the opening price). (See Figure 10.18 .)
2. E nter at the opening of the next candle. This is the entry price.
3. S et the stop loss at the high of the previous day ’s candle.
4. M easure the number of pips between the entry price and stop loss. If

Strategy Roundup
This strategy is suitable for traders with very little time to monitor the mar-
ket. Furthermore, it does not require any complex market analysis. The
entry time is predictable because the market is entered at a fi xed time of
the day, every single day.
Good morning Asia centers on the USD/JPY for three reasons:
1. T he United States and Japan are the largest and third largest econo-
mies in the world respectively.
2. T he USD/JPY is the second most traded currency pair in the world,
right after the EUR/USD.
3. J apan is the fi rst country in Asia where markets open. Hence, ample
liquidity on the USD/JPY allows traders to execute long and short posi-
tions easily.

in Chapter 6. If you are a day trader, either one of the four strategies dis-
cussed in Chapter 7 will give you lasting success. If you are a swing trader,
following the trend rider or the power ranger is an absolute must.
Trading is simple but it ’s not easy. It ’s simple because there are only a
few rules to follow—fi ve to be exact. Here they are:
1. E nsure the correct time frame. Be careful to check the time frame
on your trading platform before you trigger a trade. An uptrend on the
hourly chart may be a downtrend on the daily chart. Also, the strate-
gies discussed in this book are specifi c to certain time frames, so pay
extra attention to the time frame before you fi re off a trade.
2. O verlay the necessary indicators. Some strategies require the use
of indicators. Remember to check that the indicators have the correct
settings. Failure to check could give rise to a false setup. If you are
using the Meta Trader 4 trading platform, make use of the template
feature, which allows you to save various customized templates with
the required indicators.
3. E xecute long or short based on the strategy rules. Take note
that while the market may give you a setup, you are allowed to trigger
a trade only if all the rules fi t. Some strategies may have three steps
while others have fi ve. You must be strict and trigger a long or short
trade only when all rules are met.

236 STRATEGIES TO WIN THE GAME
4. D ouble check your entry point, stop loss, and profi t target levels.
Some traders get excited when they see a setup and hurriedly enter
trades. Ensure that your entry point, stop loss, and profi t target levels
are set according to the rules of the specifi c strategy. Don’ t worry if you
make a mistake—the Meta Trader 4 platform has a button called “Modify
Order” that allows you to alter these levels should you make any prior
mistakes.
5. R ecord your results in your trading journal. This is a good habit to
form early in your trading career. A trading journal is basically a diary
that helps you to archive the trades that you have taken. A good trad-
ing journal should include columns for you to input the trade entries
and exits and also space for you to record your emotions before, dur-
ing, and after the trade.
These fi ve rules apply across the board, regardless of which category
you are in: scalper, day trader, swing trader, position trader, or mechanical
trader.
Follow these fi ve rules conscientiously and you will be on your way to
becoming consistently profi table. That ’s the simple part. However, trading
isn ’t easy. It ’s not easy because the only person who can stop you from
achieving success in the forex market is you.
I would like to share one fi nal lesson from my Chinese mentor to illus-
trate my point better. He taught me that getting from where we are now
to where we want to go is a function of only three steps—yes, “just” three
steps.
The fi rst step is knowledge. Knowledge is defi ned as an awareness or
understanding gained through education or experience. In forex, this step
involves reading a forex quote, knowing how to execute a long or short
trade, gaining clarity on the factors that move the markets, and developing
insight into your very own trading profi le. This knowledge is thoroughly
discussed in Part One of this book, specifi cally in Chapters 1 through 5 .
The second step is action. Action is defi ned as the art of applying knowl-
edge through organized activities to achieve a desired result. In forex, this
step involves watching the markets, studying the rules, executing the trade,
and recording the results. This action is clearly detailed in Part Two of this
book, in Chapters 6 through 10 .
The third step starts with the letter “d.” When I ask the audience in my
seminars to guess what word this is, many people say decision, discipline,
or determination. Although these are good traits, the answer is not in any
of them.
The answer is desire.

Conclusion 237
What is the defi nition of desire? This is my mentor ’s defi nition:
(cid:3926)(cid:7536)(cid:6117)(cid:993)(cid:14033)(cid:712)(cid:6117)(cid:4613)(cid:980)(cid:4462)(cid:16213)(cid:452)(cid:3926)(cid:7536)(cid:6117)(cid:980)(cid:4462)(cid:16213)(cid:712)(cid:6117)(cid:4613)(cid:980)(cid:4462)(cid:14033)(cid:452)
In English, this means: “If I can ’t, then I must. If I must, then I can.”
A ny good forex mentor will be able to give you the functional ingre-
dients of knowledge and action. Unfortunately, no mentor can give you
desire. That has to come from deep inside you.
In the beginning of my story, I shared with you that I ’m not a smart guy.
I don’ t have a fi nance or economics degree. But what I had was the desire
to succeed.
Do you have the absolute desire to be a mega trading success? If your
answer is a resounding yes, congratulations, my friend. Because the other
two ingredients of knowledge and action are found between the covers of
this book.
I t is my sincere wish that you enjoyed reading this book as much as
I have enjoyed writing it. If you allow me, I will be your mentor to guide
your every step on this fascinating journey. Whether you ’re a beginner or an
advanced trader, my message remains the same: You can’ t afford to ignore
the forex market anymore.
I f you’ re a beginner, you might wonder how much time you need per
day to master this skill. The answer is just one to two hours. The forex
market is open 24 hours a day. You can start right now, without making
any change to your present lifestyle. When you start, I’ ll guarantee you one
thing: Within a few short years of seemingly not changing anything, you will
end up changing everything.
M y friend, the forex market is not just the largest fi nancial market in
the world. It is the biggest mirror to your soul. How you trade tells you who
you really are.
So let ’s get started.
Let ’s play fl at out.
Let ’s make magic.
Sincerely,
Mario Singh
