AN OPEN
LETTER TO
NEW READERS
I
f you listened to all the internet influencers telling you the things
you “need” to do every morning, here’s what your day would look
like:
4:00 a.m. wake up
4:01 a.m. meditate
5:00 a.m. drink 37 gallons of water
5:33 a.m. gratitude journal
10:45 a.m. eat (keto only)
11:00 a.m. track every penny of spending from the last 16 years
11:01 a.m. die
I dunno, guys. I prefer advice that actually works. And when I took a
hard look at the advice I gave in this book a decade ago, I realized one
thing: I was right.
If you bought this book ten years ago and followed the exact advice
in it, here’s what you would have accomplished by now.
n If you had invested just $100/month, that $12,000 would
have turned into over $20,000 (The S&P 500 averaged around
13 percent annually over the last decade.)
n If you had aggressively invested $1,000/month, that $120,000 you
contributed would have grown to more than $200,000.
n You would be spending less than 90 minutes per month on your
money.
n You would have been able to take multiple vacations and fly
business class—completely free—using credit card points.

==================================================

I Will Teach You to Be Rich
n Money would have gone from a source of anxiety and confusion
to one of calm and possibility.
As you’ll see in this book, I do things differently than typical money
“experts.” I won’t lecture you about cutting back on lattes (buy as many
as you want). I won’t try to convince you to keep a budget (I have a
better method). And one more thing: I’m a real guy. I post on Instagram
and Twitter (@ramit) and I write for millions of people on my blog and
newsletter almost every day (iwillteachyoutoberich.com). So let’s start
off doing something different: I want to hear from you. Really! Send me
an email (ramit.sethi@iwillteachyoutoberich.com, subject: new book
reader) and tell me two things:
1. What made you decide to take control of your money today?
2. What does your Rich Life look like? (Please be specific!)
I read every email and I try to respond to as many as possible.
What has I Will Teach You to Be Rich
allowed you to do?
One of my greatest joys is hearing from you about how you’ve applied
my material to change your life. I asked some of my readers to share
their results.
I paid off $10,000 in credit card debt that I accumulated while
unemployed, bought a condo in San Francisco, and am now debt-
free and building my retirement funds.
—JULIANA BRODSKY, 38
I have $200,000 in retirement savings and countless vacations
paid for by creating specific savings accounts for them; it’s hard to
put a specific number on that.
—KYLE SLATTERY, 30
I travel internationally for a month 1 or 2 times a year. Last year it
was South Africa; this year, Korea.

AN OPEN LETTER TO NEW READERS
The Rich Life is about freedom. In my case it allowed me to take
9 months off work and travel throughout Argentina, Colombia,
and the US. And now it’s allowing my wife to take a 6-month break
from work to figure out what’s next.
—SEAN WILKINS, 39
We were able to put three children into private school on one full-
time income.
—BRYAN DILBERT, 32
All that said, I’ll admit that I wasn’t perfect. Ten years ago, I made
three mistakes when writing the first edition of this book.
My first mistake was that I didn’t cover the emotions around money.
I spent time covering the nuts and bolts of personal finance—I gave you
the perfect word-for-word scripts to get late fees waived (page 42), the
exact asset allocation I use for investing (page 148), and even how to
manage money with your partner (page 292)—but if you don’t tackle
your invisible money scripts, none of it matters.
Invisible scripts are the messages you’ve absorbed from your
parents and society that guide your decisions for decades—and often
without even being aware of it. Do any of these sound familiar?
n “You’re throwing your money away on rent.”
n “We don’t talk about money in this house.”
n “Credit cards are a scam.”
n “Stop spending money on lattes.”
n “Money changes people.”
n “You don’t get that level of wealth without making a few shady
deals here and there.”
n “The stock market is gambling.”
n “Student loans are a scam.”
In this edition, I’ll show you what the most insidious, powerful
invisible money scripts are—and how to beat them.
3



==================================================
                     PAGE 14                      
==================================================

I Will Teach You to Be Rich
The second mistake I made was being too overbearing. The truth
is, you can choose what your Rich Life is and how you get there. In the
original book, I did write about the different definitions of a Rich Life,
but I didn’t acknowledge that we might take different routes to get there.
For example, your Rich Life might be to live in Manhattan. It might be
to ski forty days a year in Utah, or to save and buy a house with a huge
yard for your kids, or to fund an elementary school in Croatia. That’s
your choice.
But how you get there is also your choice. Some people choose the
traditional route of saving 10 percent, investing 10 percent, and slowly
working their way to a comfortable Rich Life. Others save 50 percent
of their income and quickly reach the “crossover point” where their
investments pay for their life—forever. (This is called “FIRE,” or Financial
Independence, Retire Early, which I cover on page 217.)
You choose your Rich Life. And in this edition, I want to show you
different ways to get there. To do that, I’ve included lots of examples of
people who took unconventional routes to create their Rich Lives.
Finally, the third mistake. Let me just say that I’ve messed up quite
a few things in my life: I’ve hired and fired the wrong people. I ruined my
chance at a TED talk by walking into the meeting unprepared. I was six
feet and 127 pounds into my mid-twenties, looking like a hairy Indian
Gumby. But nothing compares to my worst mistake of all:
Writing the actual interest rates of banks in the original edition of
this book.
Here’s what I wrote back then:
“Online banks pay a higher interest rate for savings accounts—about
2.5 to 5 percent, which would produce $25 to $50 interest per year on that
$1,000, compared with $5 per year on the Big Bank savings account.”
The information was right . . . at the time. The problem is, interest
rates change, which I forgot to mention. And in the years after the first
edition was published, they dropped—from 5 percent to 0.5 percent. I
assumed people would run the numbers and realize that the interest
rate doesn’t really matter much. For example, on a $5,000 balance,
that means your monthly interest dropped from $21 to $2. In the grand
scheme, not that big of a deal.
But when facing lower interest rates on savings accounts, readers
got mad—really mad. And they took their anger out on me. Here are a
few emails I got:
4



==================================================
                     PAGE 15                      
==================================================

AN OPEN LETTER TO NEW READERS
n “This book is a scam. Where are the 5% interest rates you talk
about??”
n “What bank has 3% interest rates??”
n “Subj: WHERE ARE THE BANKS U WROTE ABOUT”
For the last ten years, I’ve gotten over twenty of these emails every
single day. Never again. On page 84, you’ll see my favorite banks. But
not their interest rates. WHICH WILL CHANGE, GUYS. In this edition, I’ve
corrected these mistakes. And I’ve added new material.
1. New tools, new investment options, and new approaches to money.
If you want to get more aggressive about investing, I’ll show you how
(page 216). What do I think about robo-advisors? I’ll tell you (page 116).
And what about pre-nups? I share my thoughts (page 302).
2. New money scenarios you’ll confront. How do you handle relationships
and money? I’ve added new material (page 286). Once your financial
system is set up, I want you to know what to focus on next (page 260).
And finally, if you know people who complain about politics and baby
boomers to explain why they can’t pay off their debt and get ahead, they
should read my thoughts on victim culture (page 11).
3. Incredible stories from other IWT readers. I’ve included tons of new
examples, including inspirational success stories from all different kinds
of people: men and women in their twenties, thirties, forties, and fifties;
people who started from nothing and people who built on success to grow
even more. Plus, gut-wrenching stories about people who procrastinated
on implementing the material in this book—and what it cost them.
I added new material where appropriate, but I preserved techniques
that continue to work. Many people want “new” advice—but the value in
this book doesn’t come from novelty; it comes from usefulness.
In ten years, I’ve also changed. I’ve gotten married, I’ve grown my
business, and I’ve learned more about money and psychology. Now I
get the chance to share what I’ve learned with you. Amidst the noise,
the hype, the apps of the day, the IWT personal finance system works.
Long-term, low-cost investing works. Automation works. Use this book
to create your own Rich Life, just like thousands of others have.
—Ramit Sethi

INTRODUCTION
WOULD YOU
RATHER BE
SEXY OR RICH?
I
’ve always wondered why so many people gain weight after
college. I’m not talking about people with medical disorders,
but regular people who were slim in college and vowed
that they would “never, ever” let that happen to them.
Yet, little by little, most Americans gain an unhealthy
amount of weight.
In the ten years since I wrote my book, weight and health have
become such controversial topics that I was advised to delete my
references to them. But after my own journeys with nutrition, fitness,
and money, I now believe even more in the connections between them—
and that you can take control.
Weight gain doesn’t happen overnight. If it did, it would be easy
for us to see it coming—and to take steps to avoid it. Ounce by ounce,
it creeps up on us as we’re driving to work and then sitting behind a
computer for eight to ten hours a day. It happens when we move into the

real world from a college campus populated by bicyclists, runners, and
varsity athletes who once inspired us to keep fit. But try talking about
post-college weight loss with your friends and see if they say one of
these things:
“Avoid carbs!”
“Don’t eat before you go to bed, because fat doesn’t burn efficiently
when you’re sleeping.”
“Keto is the only real way to lose weight.”
“Drinking apple cider vinegar speeds up your metabolism.”
I always laugh when I hear these things. Maybe they’re correct or
maybe they’re not, but that’s not really the point.
The point is that we love to debate minutiae.
When it comes to weight loss, 99.99 percent of us need to know only
two things: Eat less and exercise more. Only elite athletes need to do
more. But instead of accepting these simple truths and acting on them,
we discuss trans fats, obscure supplements, and Whole30 versus paleo.

of people don’t need a financial adviser to help them get rich. We need
to set up accounts at solid banks, automate our day-to-day money
management (including bills, savings, and, if applicable, debt payoff).
We need to know about a few things to invest in, and then we need to
let our money grow for thirty years. But that’s not as cool or exciting, is
it? Instead, we read internet articles from “experts” who make endless
predictions about the economy and “this year’s hottest stock” without
ever being held accountable for their picks (which are wrong more than
50 percent of the time). “It’s going up!” “No, down.” As long as there is
something being said, we’re drawn to it.
Why? Because we love to debate minutiae.
When we do, we somehow feel satisfied. We might just be spinning
our wheels and failing to change anyone’s mind, but we feel as if we are
really expressing ourselves, and it’s a good feeling. We feel like we’re
getting somewhere. The problem is that this feeling is totally illusory.
Think back to the last time you and your friend talked about finances
or fitness. Did you go for a run afterward? Did you send money to your
savings account? Of course not.
People love to argue minor points, partially because they feel it
absolves them from actually having to do anything. You know what? Let
the fools debate the details. I decided to learn about money by taking
small steps to manage my own spending. Just as you don’t have to be a
certified nutritionist to lose weight or an automotive engineer to drive
a car, you don’t have to know everything about personal finance to be
rich. I’ll repeat myself: You don’t have to be an expert to get rich. You do
have to know how to cut through all the information and get started—
which, incidentally, also helps reduce the guilt.
I knew I should save for retirement, but I didn’t really know how,
besides “put some money in your 401(k).” I also thought saving
was only about NOT spending money. As a result, I felt horribly
guilty about spending money on *anything*, even if I had saved
up for it. I had also never really thought about asking for a raise
and didn’t know how to approach it. I had just treated the initial
wage I’d been offered as set in stone.

Why Is Managing Money
So Hard?
P
eople have lots and lots of reasons for not managing their
money, some of them valid, but most of them poorly veiled
excuses for laziness or not having spent ten minutes on
research. Let’s look at a few:
Info Glut
The idea that there is too much information is a real and valid concern.
“But Ramit,” you might say, “that flies in the face of all American
culture! We need more information so we can make better decisions! All
the experts on TV say this all the time, so it must be true!” Sorry, nope.
Look at the actual data and you’ll see that an abundance of information
can lead to decision paralysis, which is a fancy way of saying that with
too much information, we do nothing. Barry Schwartz writes about this
in The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less:
As the number of mutual funds in a 401(k) plan offered to
employees goes up, the likelihood that they will choose a fund—
any fund—goes down. For every 10 funds added to the array of
options, the rate of participation drops 2 percent. And for those
who do invest, added fund options increase the chances that
employees will invest in ultraconservative money market funds.
You scroll online and see ads about stocks, 401(k)s, Roth IRAs,
insurance, 529s, and international investing. Where do you start? Are
you already too late? What do you do? Too often, the answer is nothing—
and doing nothing is the worst choice you can make. As the table on the
next page shows, investing early is the best thing you can do.
Look carefully at the chart on the next page. Smart Sally actually
invests less, but ends up with about $80,000 more. She invests $200/
month from age thirty-five to age forty-five and then never touches that
money again. Dumb Dan is too preoccupied to worry about money until
he’s forty-five, at which point he starts investing $100/month until he’s
sixty-five. In other words, Smart Sally invests for ten years and Dumb
Dan for twenty years—but Smart Sally has much more money. And that’s

with just $200/month! The single most important thing you can do to be
rich is to start early.
HOW TO MAKE $60,000 MORE THAN YOUR
FRIENDS (WITH LESS WORK)
Smart Sally Dumb Dan
When beginning to
invest, the person 35 years old 45 years old

rate of return, at age Voilà—the value he invested for twice

If you’re younger, your money will grow even more. If you’re older, don’t
get discouraged. I recently got a message from a woman in her forties who
was unhappy about these numbers. “What’s the point of writing that?” she
asked. “It makes me feel bad that I’m already too far behind.”
I understand how she feels. But we can’t hide from the math—so
instead of sugarcoating the facts, I believe in showing you the truth,
including ways to increase your savings. Yes, the best time to start
investing was ten years ago. The second best time is today.
The Media Is Partially to Blame
(I Love Casting Blame)
Open the typical financial site and I bet you’ll see an article called “10
No-Hassle Frugality Tips for Getting Ahead with Your Finances” or “How
Today’s Senate Vote Affects Estate Taxes.” Reading those headlines, you
intuitively know why online columnists wrote them: to get pageviews
and sell ads.
We know that because reading yet another frugality article is not
going to change anyone’s behavior. And the estate tax affects less than
0.2 percent of people. But both of those headlines make people feel
good—or angry.
Enough! I don’t care about pageviews or stoking rage. If you’re like

me, you care about knowing where your money’s going and redirecting it
to go where you want it to go. We want our money to grow automatically,
in accounts that don’t nickel-and-dime us with fees. We don’t want to
have to become financial experts to get rich.
The Rise of Victim Culture
There’s a group of people—mostly young, disaffected people—who have
decided it’s easier to be cynical than to improve themselves.
“LOL! Invest? I can’t even save enough for pizza.”
“LOL! Find a job? What world do you live in . . .”
“Maybe if baby boomers hadn’t ruined it for all of us . . .”
People actually compete to see who’s the bigger victim. Oh, you
can’t afford a four-bedroom house at the age of 26? I can’t afford to live
in a cardboard box! Oh, you like going to parties to meet new people?
That must be nice, I have social anxiety so I can’t do that. (What? No, I
didn’t see a doctor. I diagnosed myself.)
You know who’s the real victim here?
Me. I’m offended at you being offended. And at the stupidity of this
entire victim culture.
I refuse to play into the theatrics of how you can’t afford to save even
$20 a month. When this book was originally published, I got hundreds
of angry emails accusing me of being elitist for encouraging people to
save and invest even a modest amount. Those cynics were wrong. They
surrounded themselves with other naysayers, bought flimsy arguments,
and incurred a staggering cost for their beliefs: They missed out on
hundreds of thousands of dollars of gains. Meanwhile, my readers put
in the work to create their Rich Lives.
You choose. Be a cynic or carefully evaluate your options, knowing
you’ll probably make a mistake here or there . . . but you’ll grow at each
step of the way. I choose to move forward.
I understand this is a complex issue. Yes, socioeconomic policy,
access to technology, and pure luck matter. For example, if you start off
with two parents and you graduate from college, you’re already luckier
than most people on this planet.
But we play with the cards we’re dealt. I believe in focusing on what
I can control.

For example, by the time I entered kindergarten, it was clear I would
never be in the NBA—fine. On the other hand, it was clear I would
dominate the shit out of my classmates in spelling bees. Also fine.
Then there were the gray areas, like starting a business, becoming
more fit, and learning to be better in dating. I had to learn those skills
and work really, really hard.
This is where the victim mindset comes in. So many people complain
about politicians and sociological problems without looking around at
their own behavior. They give up at the first sign of failure. If you want to
be a passenger in life, fine—go with the flow. I’ve found it’s a lot more
fun to be the captain of my own ship, even if I go off course sometimes.
As you can see, I don’t have a lot of sympathy for people who
complain about their situation in life but do nothing about it. That’s
why I wrote this book! I want you to be empowered to take control of
your situation, no matter where in life you started from. I want you to
have a level playing field against these huge Wall Street firms, mindless
articles, and even your own psychology.
Here are a few examples of victim culture when it comes to money:
“I can’t save any money.” Years ago, when the economy crashed, I
launched something called the “Save $1,000 in 30 Days Challenge,”
where I showed people tactical ways to save money using fresh
psychological techniques. Thousands of people joined and worked to
save thousands and thousands of dollars.
Except a few people.
While most people were supportive, I was surprised by how many
people were actually offended by the very concept of a “Save $1,000
in 30 Days Challenge” because they didn’t even earn that much each
month, or they found my recommendations to be “too obvious”—
even though I defined “saving” as cutting costs, earning more, and
optimizing spending.
Here are some examples of their complaints:
n “Doing this is impossible for me . . . I don’t make enough to try this
exercise.”
n “Nice idea, but the current median family income here in Ohio is
$58,000/year. After taxes this means a monthly paycheck of about
$3,400. Note that this is the median, so fully half of Ohio families
12



==================================================

WOuLD YOu RAThER BE SExY OR Rich?
live on less than this! I doubt many of them could save $1,000/
month without selling off their children.”
n “This’d be nice . . . If I even made $1,000 in a month, I might try it.
But I’m in university . . .”
First of all, notice that crazy people have a particular way of writing—
they’re always trailing off at the end of a sentence. If someone writes
you and says, “It must be nice . . .” or “That sounds hard . . .” odds are
good that they’re a serial killer who will be knocking on your door very
soon, then wearing your skin as a raincoat.
Also, people love to use their particular situation—living in Ohio, or
Malaysia, or not having gone to an Ivy League school—to explain why
they can’t get the same results others can. I used to engage and show
them examples of people in their own area who got amazing results.
Their response? “Well, did they have [increasingly obscure criteria:
moved around three times as a kid, eleven fingers, whatever]?” As soon
as I said no, they said, “See? I knew this wouldn’t work for me.” Cynics
don’t want results; they want an excuse to not take action. Ironically,
even if they win their own manufactured argument, they lose overall,
because they’re stuck in a prison of their mind.
“The world is against me.” Yes, there are lots of societal problems
right now. But when it comes to personal finance, I focus on what I can
control. This idea escapes whiners, whose natural reaction when asked
to actually do something about their situation is to create reasons
why they can’t. It used to be personal excuses (“no time”). Now, with
the rise of victim culture, it’s more politically correct to point to some
external force, like median earnings or economic policy. Yes, getting
your financial life in order does require some work. But the rewards far
surpass the effort.
The truth is that these whiners miss the point. While saving $1,000
in a month was eminently reasonable, it was also an aspirational goal.
If you couldn’t save $1,000, what about $500? Or $200? Finally, the
people who complained about money a year ago are probably still
complaining, while many of the people who took the challenge saved
hundreds and even thousands of dollars.

Other People We Can Blame for Our
Money Problems
There are other common excuses for why we don’t manage our money.
Most of them don’t stand up to scrutiny:
n “ Our education system doesn’t teach this.” It’s easy for people
in their twenties to wish that their colleges had offered some
personal finance training. Guess what? Most colleges do offer
those classes. You just didn’t take them!
n “ Credit card companies and banks are out to profit off us.”
Yes, they are. So stop complaining and learn how to beat the
companies instead of letting them beat you.
n “ I’m afraid of losing money.” That’s fair, especially after global
crises where front-page articles used words like “tanked” and
“lost generation.” But you need to take a long-term view: The
economy grows and contracts in cycles. If you withdrew your
money from the stock market in 2009, you missed out on one
of the longest sustained periods of growth in history. Fear is no
excuse to do nothing with your money. Remember, you can choose
among many different investment options—some aggressive,
some conservative. It all depends on how much risk you’re willing
to take. In fact, by automating your money, you can put yourself
in a position to excel when others are scared—by continuing to
consistently save and invest. When others are scared, there are
bargains to be found.
n “ What if I don’t know where to get an extra $100 per month?”
You don’t need to earn another penny. I’ll show you how to
streamline your existing spending to generate that money to
invest. Follow my CEO Method: Cut costs, Earn more, and Optimize
your existing spending.
n “I don’t want average returns.” Our culture stigmatizes being
average. Who wants to have an average relationship? Or an average
income? Financial firms have weaponized that fear of average: They
suggest it’s bad to be average, that it’s boring, and that you can do
better. There's actually an entire ad campaign based on this idea
by a popular robo-advisor whose tagline reads “Be better than

average.” The truth is, you likely can’t beat average returns. In fact,
average 8 percent returns are actually very good. Ironically, people
who fear “being average” do exactly the things that make them
perform worse than average: trade frequently, make outlandish
bets, incur high taxes, and pay unnecessary fees. Remember:
In relationships and work, we want to be better than average. In
investing, average is great.
You’re not a victim, you’re in control. Once you truly internalize that,
you can start to go on offense. No more being paralyzed by the thought
that you have to get every single part of your personal finances perfectly
organized before you can begin to manage your money.
Do you need to be the Iron Chef to cook a grilled-cheese sandwich?
No, and once you make your first meal, it’s easier to cook something more
complicated the next time around. The single most important factor to
getting rich is getting started, not being the smartest person in the room.
Put the Excuses Aside
L
isten up, crybabies: This isn’t your grandma’s house and I’m not
going to bake you cookies and coddle you. A lot of your financial
problems are caused by one person: you. Instead of blaming
circumstances and corporate America for your financial situation, you
need to focus on what you can change yourself. Just as the diet industry
has overwhelmed us with too many choices, personal finance is a
confusing mess of overblown hype, myths, outright deception—and
us, feeling guilty about not doing enough or not doing it right. If you’re
not satisfied with your finances and you’re willing to take a hard look in
the mirror, you’ll discover one inescapable truth: The problem, and the
solution, is you.
Let’s put the excuses aside. What if you could consciously decide
how to spend your money, rather than say, “I guess that’s how much I
spent last month”? What if you could build an automatic infrastructure
that made all your accounts work together and automated your savings?
What if you could invest simply and regularly without fear? Guess what?
You can! I’ll show you how to take the money you’re making and redirect
it to the places you want it to go—including substantially growing your
money over the long term, no matter what the economy is like.

The Key Messages of
I Will Teach You to Be Rich
I
believe in small steps. I want to reduce the number of choices
that paralyze us. It’s more important to get started than to spend
an exhaustive amount of time researching the best fund in the
universe. I Will Teach You to Be Rich is about taking the first step—
understanding the barriers that keep us from managing our money and
then tearing them down and putting our money in the right places so
we can achieve our goals. Frankly, your goal probably isn’t to become a
financial expert. It’s to live your life and let money serve you. So instead
of saying, “How much money do I need to make?” you’ll say, “What do I
want to do with my life—and how can I use money to do it?” And instead
of being driven by fear, you’ll be guided by what history has shown us
about investing and growth.
I’ll keep it simple: Too many books try to cover everything about
money, leaving you holding a book that you “should” read but don’t
because it’s overwhelming. I want you to know enough to get started
setting up automated accounts and investing, even with just $100. So
here are the essential messages of I Will Teach You to Be Rich:
The 85 Percent Solution: Getting started is more important than becoming
an expert. Too many of us get overwhelmed thinking we need to manage
our money perfectly, which leads us to do nothing at all. That’s why the
easiest way to manage your money is to take it one step at a time—and
not worry about being perfect. I’d rather act and get it 85 percent right
than do nothing. Think about it: 85 percent of the way is far better than
zero percent. Once your money system is good enough—or 85 percent
of the way there—you can get on with your life and go do the things you
really want to do.
It’s okay to make mistakes. It’s better to make them now, with a little bit of
money, so that when you have more, you’ll know what to avoid.
Spend extravagantly on the things you love and cut costs mercilessly on
the things you don’t. This book isn’t about telling you to stop buying
lattes. Instead, it’s about being able to actually spend more on the things
you love by not spending money on all the knucklehead things you don’t

The Best Mistake I Ever Made
When I was in high school, my parents told me that if I wanted to go
to college, I’d need to pay for it with scholarships. So like a good
Indian son, I started applying . . . and applying and applying. In the end, I’d
applied for about sixty scholarships and had won hundreds of thousands
of dollars.
But my best scholarship was the first one—an award for $2,000. The
organization wrote a check directly to me. I took it and invested in the
stock market—and immediately lost half my money.
Oops. That’s when I decided that I really needed to learn about money.
I read the personal-finance books, watched the TV shows, and bought
the magazines. After a while, I also started sharing what I’d learned. I
taught informal classes to friends at Stanford (even though in the early
days, nobody would ever attend). Then, in 2004, I began writing a blog
called “I Will Teach You to Be Rich,” covering the basics of saving, banking,
budgeting, and investing. The rest, as they say, is history.
care about. Look, it’s easy to want the best of everything: We want to go
out all the time, live in a great apartment, buy new clothes, drive a new
car, and travel anytime we want. The truth is, you have to prioritize. My
friend Jim once called to tell me that he’d gotten a raise at work. On the
same day, he moved into a smaller apartment. Why? Because he doesn’t
care very much about where he lives, but he loves spending money on
camping and biking. That’s called conscious spending. (Learn how one of
my friends consciously spends $21,000 per year going out on page 132.)
There’s a difference between being sexy and being rich. When I hear people
talk about the stocks they bought, sold, or shorted last week, I realize
that my investment style sounds pretty boring: “Well, I bought a few good
funds five years ago and haven’t done anything since, except buy more on
an automatic schedule.” But investment isn’t about being sexy—it’s about
making money, and when you look at investment literature, buy-and-hold
investing wins over the long term, every time.

Don’t live in the spreadsheet. I encourage you to pick your financial
system and move on with your life, which means not “living in the
spreadsheet,” or obsessing over every tiny change in your spending and
in the market. The idea that you could do this might seem far-fetched
right now, but by the time you’re done with this book you’ll be extremely
comfortable with your money and investing. I’ve known too many people
who end up tracking every single fluctuation in their net worth, running
different scenarios in Excel and modeling out how soon they can retire.
Don’t do this. You’ll turn into a social weirdo and, more important, it’s
unnecessary. If I do my job right, you’ll automate your money and live
your Rich Life, which takes place outside the spreadsheet.
Play offense, not defense. Too many of us play defense with our finances.
We wait until the end of the month, then look at our spending and
shrug: “I guess I spent that much.” We accept onerous fees. We don’t
question complicated advice because it’s given to us in a language we
don’t understand. In this book, I’ll teach you to go on offense with your
credit cards, your banks, your investments, and even your own money
psychology. My goal is for you to craft your own Rich Life by the end of
Chapter 9. Get aggressive! No one’s going to do it for you.
I Will Teach You to Be Rich is about using money to design your Rich
Life. I’ll teach you how to set up your accounts to create an automatic
financial infrastructure that will run smoothly with minimal intervention.
You’ll also learn what to avoid, some surprising findings from financial
literature (is real estate really a good investment?), and how to avoid
common financial mistakes. And you’ll start taking action instead of
debating minutiae. All this will take you just six weeks—then you’ll be
on the road to being rich. Doesn’t that sound good?
Why Do You Want to Be Rich?
I
’ve talked to more than a million people about personal finance
over the last fifteen years through my website and speaking
engagements. When I do, I always ask two questions:
n W hy do you want to be rich?
n W hat does being rich mean to you?

Most people never spend even ten minutes thinking through
what “rich” means to them. Here’s a hint: It’s different for everyone,
and money is just a small part of being rich. For example, my friends
all value different things. Paul loves eating out at Michelin-starred
restaurants where a meal might cost $500. Nicole loves traveling.
And Nick loves buying clothes. If you don’t consciously choose what
“rich” means, it’s easy to end up mindlessly trying to keep up with your
friends. I consider myself rich now that I can do these things:
n Make career decisions because I want to, not because of money
n Help my parents with their retirement, so they don’t have to work if
they don’t want to
n Spend extravagantly on the things I love and be relentlessly frugal
about the things I don’t (e.g., live in a nice apartment in New York
but not own a car)
Every December, I sit down with my wife and we get intentional
about the next year. Where do we want to travel? Who do we want to
invite with us? What can we imagine doing in the next year that we’ll
remember for the next fifty years? This planning process—where we get
to intentionally design our Rich Lives—is one of the most fun things we
do together as a couple.
Before you go further, I encourage you to think about your Rich Life.
Why do you want to be rich? What do you want to do with your wealth?
Get really specific. If your Rich Life is “I want to take a taxi instead
of a bus,” write it down! I realized I live in New York but I hadn’t been
taking advantage of all the cultural events here, so I decided that
once every quarter, I’d go to a museum or Broadway show. Once I set
the intention, it became a part of my Rich Life. Don’t be embarrassed
about how small—or big—your vision is. For example, when I first wrote
down my list of a Rich Life, one of the key goals was being able to order
appetizers from a restaurant menu, which I never did as a kid. As time
went on, my goals got bigger.
When you picture your ideal life, what are you doing in it?

10 Rules for a Rich Life
1. A Rich Life means you can spend extravagantly on the things you love
as long as you cut costs mercilessly on the things you don’t.
2. Focus on the Big Wins—the five to ten things that get you
disproportionate results, including automating your savings and
investing, finding a job you love, and negotiating your salary. Get the Big
Wins right and you can order as many lattes as you want.
3. Investing should be very boring—and very profitable—over the
long term. I get more excited eating tacos than checking my investment
returns.
4. There’s a limit to how much you can cut, but no limit to how much
you can earn. I have readers who earn $50,000/year and ones who earn
$750,000/year. They both buy the same loaves of bread. Controlling
spending is important, but your earnings become super-linear.
5. Your friends and family will have lots of “tips” once you begin your
financial journey. Listen politely, then stick to the program.
6. Build a collection of “spending frameworks” to use when deciding on
buying something. Most people default to restrictive rules (“I need to cut
back on eating out . . .”), but you can flip it and decide what you’ll always
spend on, like my book-buying rule: If you’re thinking about buying a book,
just buy it. Don’t waste even five seconds debating it. Applying even one
new idea from a book is worth it. (Like this one.)
7. Beware of the endless search for “advanced” tips. So many people
seek out high-level answers to avoid the real, hard work of improving step
by step. It’s easier to dream about winning the Boston Marathon than to
go out for a ten-minute jog every morning. Sometimes the most advanced
thing you can do is the basics, consistently.
8. You’re in control. This isn’t a Disney movie and nobody’s coming to
rescue you. Fortunately, you can take control of your finances and build
your Rich Life.
9. Part of creating your Rich Life is the willingness to be unapologetically
different. Once money isn’t a primary constraint, you’ll have the freedom

to design your own Rich Life, which will almost certainly be different from

using the system in this book, you’ll see that the most important part
of a Rich Life is outside the spreadsheet—it involves relationships, new
experiences, and giving back. You earned it.
What You’ll Get Out of
This Book
M
ost people think that investing means “buying stocks,” as
if they should buy and sell random stocks and somehow
magically make a profit. Because they’ve started with a
mistaken assumption—that investing means picking stocks—the ones
who decide to learn more go down the rabbit hole of fancy terms like
“hedge funds,” “derivatives,” and “call options.”
In reality, their fundamental assumption was incorrect. Investing
isn’t about picking stocks. In fact, your investment plan is actually more
important than any individual investment you make. Sadly, most people
actually think you need this level of complexity to get rich because they
see people talking about this stuff online each day. Guess what? For
individual investors like you and me, these options are irrelevant.
It sounds sexy, but when individual investors talk about complicated
concepts like this, it’s like two elementary school tennis players arguing
about the string tension of their racquets. Sure, it might matter a little,
but they’d be much better tennis players if they just went outside and
hit some balls for a few hours each day.
Simple, long-term investing works. This idea gets nothing but yawns
and eye rolls. But you decide: Do you want to sit around impressing
others with your sexy vocabulary, or do you want to join me on my gold-
lined throne as we’re fed grapes and fanned with palm fronds?
I Will Teach You to Be Rich will help you figure out where your money
is going and redirect it to where you want it to go. Saving for a vacation
to China? A wedding? Just want to make your money grow? Here’s the
six-week program that will let you tackle it.

CHAPTER 1
OPTIMIZE
YOUR
CREDIT CARDS
How to beat the credit card companies at their own game
Y
ou’ll never see an Indian driving a two-door coupe.
Really, think about it. If you have a neighborhood
Indian—let’s call him Raj—this guy is driving a practical
four-door car, usually a Honda Accord or Toyota Camry.
However, Indian people aren’t just fanatical about
driving sensible cars. We’re absolutely nuts about
hammering down the price to the last penny. Take my dad, for example.
He’ll bargain for five straight days just to buy one car. I’ve been along for
the ride on these weeklong negotiating sessions with him before. Once,
as he was literally about to sign the papers, he stopped, asked them
to throw in free floor mats (a $50 value), and walked away when they
refused. This, after he’d spent five days bargaining them down. As he
dragged me from the dealership, I stared straight ahead, shell-shocked.
23



==================================================
                     PAGE 34                      
==================================================

I Will Teach You to Be Rich
As you can imagine, by the time I went to buy my own car, I had
been steeped in a rich tradition of negotiating. I knew how to make
unreasonable demands with a straight face and never take no for an
answer. I took a more modern approach, however: Instead of spending
a week going from dealership to dealership, I simply invited seventeen
dealers in Northern California to bid against each other for my business
while I sat at home and browsed around the internet, calmly reviewing the
emails and faxes (yes, really) as they came in. (For more about buying a
car, see page 315.) In the end, I found a great deal in Palo Alto and walked
in ready to sign the papers. Everything was going smoothly until the
dealer went to check my credit. He came back smiling. “You know, you
have the best credit of anyone I’ve ever seen at your age,” he said.
“Thanks,” I replied, actually wanting to say, “AWWW, YEAH, I KNEW
IT.” That’s because I was a weird twentysomething Indian who chooses a
four-door Accord for his dream car and prides himself on his credit score.
Then the dealer said, “Hmm.”
“Hmm?” I asked.
“Well,” he said, “it looks like you have great credit, but not enough
credit sources.” The bottom line, he told me, was that they couldn’t
offer me the low-interest option we had talked about. Instead of 1.9
percent interest, it would be 4.9 percent. That didn’t sound like much,
but I pulled out a notepad and did a quick calculation. The difference
would be more than $2,200 over the life of my car loan. Because I was
getting such a great deal on the car, I convinced myself that the higher
interest rate was okay, and I signed the papers for the loan. But I was
still pissed. Why should I have to pay an extra two grand when I had
great credit?
Most people weren’t raised like me, so I understand that you
probably hate negotiating. Most Americans do. We’re not sure what to
say, we get nervous about looking cheap, and then we look at ourselves
and say, “Is this really worth it?” In a pool of sweaty discomfort, most of
us conclude “No”—and we pay full price.
I have a fresh perspective: It’s not worth negotiating everything,
but there are a few areas of life where negotiation is a Big Win. In this
chapter, I’m going to show you how to go on offense and squeeze as
many rewards and benefits out of your credit cards as possible. You’re
going to start winning against them. And for the first time, negotiating
is going to be fun.

Optimize YOur Credit Cards
The Usual Credit Card Scare Tactics
Virtually every section on credit cards in every book starts with these
three scare tactics.
Scary stats. According to the Prosperity Now Scorecard, the median US
household credit card debt is $2,241, and the median student loan debt
is $17,711. The Fed Reserve notes that “Four in 10 adults in 2017 would
have to either borrow money, sell something, or simply not be able to
pay if faced with a $400 emergency expense.”
Scary headlines. “The looming debt crisis will hurt these Americans
the most,” reports CNBC. Or this one from the Washington Post:
“A debt crisis is on the horizon.” Business Insider reports that
“America’s student debt crisis is worse than we thought.”
Scary emotions. Confusion, anxiety, and lies—the media knows that if
they employ these, they’ll sell pageviews and ads.
Reading these scare tactics, how do you feel? Most of us respond by
shutting down and ignoring the problem.
Debt was about fear. I didn’t talk about it, I didn’t look at the whole
picture, I avoided any conversation or thought about it.
—WARREN KOPP, 36
Debt was always at the back of my mind. I couldn’t enjoy spending
the money I had because it haunted me.
—CHRIS BEHRENS, 45
I remember feeling embarrassed when I would apply for a credit
card and get turned down . . . When debt collectors would call,
I would feel embarrassed and stressed about ignoring the call,
because I owed money, but couldn’t afford to pay it off.
—ALLISON REYNOLDS, 28
The media thrives on creating fear and anxiety around debt, as
if it’s inescapable and crippling. And they rarely suggest solutions—

when they do, they’re along the lines of “eat out less.” Thanks, guys.
The result is a tornado of negative emotions. We feel helpless. We feel
outraged. Who should get the blame? I don’t know, but somebody should.
Most of all, we do nothing. This is how “outrage culture” works—it
makes you feel angry and exhausted . . . and then you go back to doing
nothing.
I have a different approach.
The Way I See It
Credit cards give you thousands of dollars worth of perks. If you pay your
bill on time, they’re a free short-term loan. They can help you keep
track of your spending much more easily than cash, and they let you
download your transaction history for free. Most offer free warranty
extensions on your purchases and free rental car insurance. Many offer
rewards and points worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
Credit cards are also convenient enemies. Almost everyone has
a bad story about late fees, unauthorized charges, or overspending.
Not surprisingly, many pundits have a knee-jerk reaction to credit
cards: “Using credit cards is the worst financial decision you can make,”
they shout. “Cut them all up!” What an easy battle cry for people who
want simple solutions and don’t realize the benefits of multiple sources
of credit.
The truth about credit cards lies somewhere between these two
extremes. As long as you manage them well, they’re worth having. But
if you don’t completely pay off your bill at the end of the month, you’ll
owe an enormous amount of interest on the remainder, usually about
14 percent. This is what’s known as the annual percentage rate, or APR.
Credit card companies also tack on a whopping fee every time you miss a
payment—usually around $35. It’s also easy to overuse credit cards and
find yourself in debt, as many American credit card users have done.
This isn’t meant to scare you away from using credit cards. In fact,
instead of playing defense by avoiding credit cards altogether, I want
you to play offense by using credit cards responsibly and getting as
many benefits out of them as possible. To do so, you need to optimize
your credit card(s) and use them as a spearhead to improve your overall
credit. By the end of this chapter, you’ll know how to squeeze the
credit card companies for everything they’re worth—without paying

unnecessary fees—and you’ll know how to use your cards to boost your
all-important credit score. I’ll show you how to negotiate with credit
card companies and reveal secret perks that nobody talks about. And
I’ll show you exactly how I maximize my credit cards for perks and cash
back, including examples of how I use points for free flights and high-
end hotel stays.
When I was traveling with my fiancée to see her family in Dubai,
I surprised her with a three-night stay at a resort in the desert
that could only be described as 7-star. We had a private villa in
traditional bedouin style overlooking the Dubai desert with a
private pool, and all meals at the resort were provided. The whole
experience easily would have cost $2,000-plus a night, but I did
the whole thing for free with points.
—NATHAN LACHENMYER, 29
I recently booked 2 round-trip tickets from San Francisco to Italy
for a 2-week vacation this fall. The flights were completely free
with credit card points!
—JANE PHILIPPS, 30
In the past year I’ve flown business class to Spain and stayed at
luxury hotels for a week, flown round-trip business class with my
girlfriend to Thailand, and flown my mother to Germany business
class to visit for her father’s 80th birthday. I’m also about to
redeem miles to go to Budapest next spring!
—JORDAN PETIT, 27
Student loans can be a great decision. Journalists love to write about
the student debt “crisis.” Yet a student loan can be one of the best
investments you ever make, with the average bachelor’s degree holder
earning over $1 million more than people with only a high school
diploma. Yes, debt sucks, and yes, many predatory colleges and
graduate schools actively lie to young Americans about the actual value
of their degree—a problem that’s completely inexcusable and supported
by an educational-industrial complex. Many earnest but naive students

were misled by their counselors, colleges, and even their parents about
incurring student loan debt on degrees that will never pay off.
But you can pay off your debt faster than you thought possible (to see
how, flip to page 284). And your college degree was almost certainly worth
it—even if you’re only considering the financial return on investment and
not including the benefits of making lifelong friends, building priceless
habits of discipline, and exposing yourself to new ideas as an educated
citizen. Ignore the scare tactics of the student loan “crisis.” If you have
student loan debt, use the material in this book to create a repayment plan.
Most people are playing the game wrong. I’ve spoken to literally
thousands of people who are in debt. Some of them have had tough
situations—unexpected illnesses, elderly parents who need support,
surprise expenses. But, candidly, some of them are simply playing
the game wrong. They’ve never spent a weekend reading a book on
personal finance. They don’t even know how much they owe! Instead of
doing the work to aggressively win at the game of debt, they complain.
It’s like watching a four-year-old trying to play Monopoly, then realizing
they can’t understand the rules (which they’ve never read), getting
angry, and flipping the board over. I’ll show you how to win.
Bank of America Hates Me
Bank of America, one of the world’s shittiest banks, hates me because
I’ve named them as one of the worst banks out there. Good news!
Ten years later, they’re still on my list for screwing over my readers
repeatedly. (Wells Fargo is also on my list.) I don’t cut deals with banks—I
don’t need their money—and I call out the best, and worst, financial
companies for my readers.
As you can imagine, the worst companies don’t like being named in a
New York Times bestselling book. I discovered Bank of America hates me
because one of my friends works in their corporate office. One day, she
reached out to me and said, “Did you know you’re on a Bank of America
influencer list?” I was surprised. Me? Little old me?
Then she added: “It’s a negative influencer list.”
I have never been so proud.

When it comes to student loans and credit cards, my goal is for
you to stop playing defense. I’m going to show you how to play offense
instead. For student loans, make an aggressive plan and minimize the
amount of interest you pay. For credit cards, I squeeze every single
benefit out of them. Basically I want the credit card companies to hate
you, as they hate me.
The best part is how fast you can change your financial life once you
switch from playing defense to playing offense with your money.
In the 3½ years since I read the book, I paid off $14,000 in credit
card debt and $8,000 in student loan debt.

In the past year since I started this book, I opened a 401(k) and
a Roth IRA, understand how they work, and have funded $7,200
toward my retirement. I also opened 2 credit cards to build my
utilization and boost my credit score and am 100 percent a
deadbeat customer who pays on time every month in full.

I learned how to automate my credit card payments, set up
flexible spending, and start investing in index funds. Today I have
amassed over $40,000 in my “net worth,” having been out of
school for less than 2 years. Thanks for the advice!

Playing Offense: Use Credit to
Accelerate Your Rich Life
P
eople love to pick sexy investments and use fancy terms like
“distressed securities” and “EBITDA” when they focus on getting
rich. But they often ignore something that is so simple, so basic,
that it just doesn’t seem important: their credit. Ironically, credit is one
of the most vital factors in getting rich, but because it’s hard to wrap
our minds around it, we often overlook it entirely. It’s time to wake up

==================================================

I Will Teach You to Be Rich
and pay attention to it, because establishing good credit is the first step
in building an infrastructure for getting rich. Think about it: Our largest
purchases are almost always made on credit, and people with good
credit save tens of thousands of dollars on these purchases. Credit has
a far greater impact on your finances than saving a few dollars a day on
a cup of coffee.
There are two main components to your credit (also known as your
credit history): your credit report and your credit score. These boring
terms can actually save you tens of thousands of dollars over your
lifetime, so listen up. This is an example of a Big Win—worth paying
attention to.
Your credit report gives potential lenders basic information about
you, your accounts, and your payment history. It tracks all credit-related
activities (e.g., credit cards and loans), although recent activities are
given higher weight.
Your credit score (often called your FICO score because it was
created by the Fair Isaac Corporation) is a single, easy-to-read number
between 300 and 850 that represents your credit risk to lenders. It’s
like an SAT score for the credit industry (higher is better). The lenders
take this number and, with a few other pieces of information, such
as your salary and age, decide if they’ll lend you money for credit
like a credit card, mortgage, or car loan. They’ll charge you more or
less for the loan depending on your score, which signifies how risky
you are.
It’s ridiculously easy to check your credit score and credit report—
and you should do it right now. Once a year, by law, you’re allowed to
obtain your credit report for free at annualcreditreport.com. It includes
basic information about all your accounts and payment history.
Lots of people use Credit Karma (creditkarma.com) to get a free
credit score, but I prefer the official credit score from MyFico (myfico.
com), which is more accurate even though it has a small fee.
Why are your credit report and credit score important? Because a
good credit score can save you hundreds of thousands of dollars in
interest charges. How? Well, if you have good credit, it makes you less
risky to lenders, meaning they can offer you a better interest rate on
loans. Maybe you don’t need a loan today, but in three or four years,
you might need to start thinking about a car or a house. So please
don’t scoff at or dismiss what you just read. One of the key differences

on:

(How reliable you are.
Late payments hurt you.)

credit you have available, aka your

15% length of history n Your credit history,or whom
(How long you’ve had credit) you’ve paid, how consistently,

If you doubt that a loan’s interest rate really makes that much of a
difference, check out the table on the next page. Look at the differences
in what you’d pay for a 30-year mortgage based on your credit score.
As you can see, a high credit score can save you tens of thousands
of dollars over your lifetime (or more if you live in a high-cost-of-living
area). While other people spend many hours cutting coupons, agonizing
over generic brands at the grocery store, or beating themselves up
over a morning latte, they’re failing to see the bigger picture. It’s fine to
keep a close eye on your expenses, but you should focus on spending
time on the things that matter, the Big Wins. So let’s dig into tactics for
improving your credit, which is quantifiably worth much more than any
advice about frugality.

GUESS HOW MUCH AN IPHONE COSTS IF YOU
FINANCE IT WITH A CREDIT CARD?
One of the biggest problems with credit cards is the hidden cost of using
them. It may be incredibly convenient to swipe your card at every retailer,
but if you don’t pay your bill every month, you’ll end up owing way more
than you realize.
Paying minimum
Let’s say you buy payments, it will You’ll pay this much
this . . . take this long to in interest
pay it off . . .
$1,000 iPhone 9 years, 2 months $732.76

$10,000 furniture 32 years, 2 months $13,332.06
Assumes 14% APR and 2% minimum payment
If you paid only the minimum monthly balance on your $10,000
purchase, it would take you more than 32 years and cost you more than
$13,000 in interest alone, more than the purchase price itself. Remember,
this doesn’t even factor in your “opportunity cost”: Instead of paying off
a $10,000 sofa for over 30 years, if you’d invested the same amount and
earned 8 percent, it would’ve turned into about $27,000! Try calculating
how much your own purchases really cost at bankrate.com/brm/calc/

Getting a New Card

ow do you choose the right credit card? I have a few simple
rules that I use when choosing my own cards:
n Don’t accept credit card offers that come in the mail or from
retail stores like Gap or Nordstrom.
n Squeeze every reward you can out of your credit cards.
n Pick a good one, then move on with your life.
Now here’s how to do it.

Get rewarded for your spending. There are different levels of rewards
cards. Some are very basic, while others offer hundreds of dollars in
annual benefits—or even thousands, depending on how much you spend.
First, decide what you want to get rewarded with—cash back or
travel. I recommend cash back because it’s straightforward, there are
excellent cash back cards, and it’s simpler than travel rewards, which
require more sophistication to truly maximize. (For more on maximizing
travel rewards, look up forums on “credit card churning.”)
Once you decide on the primary reward you want, use a site like
bankrate.com to sort through your options.
Most of the best rewards cards have fees. Are they worth it? You
should run the numbers to decide, which takes less than 5 minutes.
Here’s a quick rule of thumb: If you spend thousands per month on
your credit card, the rewards are usually worth it. But if you spend more
modestly or you’re not sure whether you want to pay a fee, spend a few
minutes doing a quick analysis by searching for “credit card rewards
calculator.” Plug in your numbers and you’ll quickly see which rewards
cards are worth it for you.
Bottom line: It’s almost always worth getting a rewards card. Be sure
to do your homework and pick one where you value the rewards.
Don’t sign up for retail store credit cards. These cards might as well
have “You Screwed Yourself” written on them in thirty-six-point type. I
can’t count how many times I’ve been in line and seen someone buying
$40 of socks or a cheap T-shirt or two. I just wait for the conversation
I know is about to happen. “Would you like to open a credit card?” the
salesperson asks, praying he meets his commission goal for the month.
“You’ll save ten percent.”
Yup! There it is! Between clenched teeth, it’s me muttering, “Shut
your mouth, Ramit. Don’t say anything. They don’t want your unsolicit—”
Person at the register: “Hmm . . . sure, I’ll open that card. Why not?
It couldn’t hurt.”
Two points for our friend who decided to open a retail credit card:
1. As a general rule, whenever you say, “It couldn’t hurt,” IT VERY MUCH
COULD HURT. Every single time I’ve said that in my life, I’ve proceeded
to make a huge mistake.
2. This person just opened one of the most predatory cards out there to
save $4. Jesus. You might as well reach into a dirty gutter to find a few

Searching for Credit Cards Online
A secret of the credit card industry: When you compare credit cards
online, you’re entering a murky world of SEO and affiliate fees where
nearly all credit card listings are compensated. This means that virtually
every site is being paid for showing you their “recommended” cards, and
it’s not easy to see why certain cards are being recommended. You can
usually find very good cards on these sites. But if you’re a high spender,
be sure to take a few extra minutes searching around. For example, when
I was beginning to plan my wedding, I looked for the best cash back card.
Buried at the bottom of some forum post, I found a cash back credit card
from Alliant Credit Union that paid 3 percent for the first year of spending,
then 2 percent afterward. That was the best cash back reward on the
market, but the card never showed up in my original searches.
pennies. That would be cheaper than the financial beating you’re going
to eventually take.
Get some standards, people. You wouldn’t marry the first person
who touched your elbow. Why would you sign up for a retail store
card that has high fees, near-extortionate interest rates, and terrible
rewards?
As for the credit card offers that come in the mail, generally you
can find better options by researching online. (Sidenote: If you find
yourself getting a ton of credit card offers and other junk mail, go to
optoutprescreen.com to get off their marketing lists.)
I forgot to pay a stupid $25 Gap bill. It was a big PITA over 25
bucks. They dinged my credit and almost sent it to collections. I
followed the process to challenge it 6 months later. Told them
it was a one-time mistake. I believe the phone agent gave me
an address to send a letter. I did and a couple months later the
remark was gone from my account.

I Will Teach You to Be Rich
The Exact Credit Cards I Use
Years ago, I decided to optimize my credit card rewards. I knew I was
about 95 percent of the way there—I had cash back and travel cards
for my business and personal spending—but I wanted to get truly dialed in
for that last 5 percent. As my business had grown to dozens of employees,
my spending had increased considerably. These rewards started to
become meaningful and I wanted to be sure I was getting every benefit
available.
For example, at a certain point, we were spending over $40,000 on
ads every month. I know most people don’t need to maximize points at
this level. But I think it’s fascinating, and I want to share what I learned.
I wanted to know:
n Am I squeezing out every possible reward from my spending?
n How should I handle large spending events, like a wedding or a team
retreat?
n When should I use a cash back card versus a travel card?
Most important, what am I missing? What are all the cool things I
should be asking for that I don’t even know about?
Finding answers was harder than I thought. First, I posted on Facebook,
asking if anyone knew an expert who could audit my spending and give me
feedback on the cards I was using. Most of the people I initially talked to
were focused on maximizing points for frugal traveling. That’s cool, but it’s
not really my thing.
Then I had an unusual call with a guy named Chris.
“I had my credit cards in pretty good shape,” Chris told me. “But then I
wanted to get really good. And I know guys like you and me don’t have a lot of
time to play the credit card games of opening and closing cards all the time.”
I was listening.
Chris told me how he set up his cards to maximize rewards to the tune
of millions of points. I was interested, but I wanted to see if he really knew
what he was talking about. Then he said this.

CHRIS: You want to know what I do to really squeeze the points out of
my credit cards?
RAMIT: YES!
CHRIS: Some hotels will give you five hundred points for every night you
waive housekeeping. So if I’m traveling alone, I get a room with two beds.
I switch beds, switch towels, and I get my five hundred points.
When I heard this, I was sold.
He was so detailed, so fanatical, that he had optimized down to the
level of towel usage. I had met my hero.
Chris Hutchins is the CEO of Grove (hellogrove.com), a financial
planning service geared toward young professionals. He also happens to
be extremely skilled in optimizing travel rewards.
My goal was to build a “playbook” of how to use credit cards to
maximize rewards for my personal and business lives. My assistant, Jill,
spent weeks working with Chris, analyzing my spending and upcoming
expenses. The goal was to boil it down to a simplified “playbook” that Jill
could use when making purchase decisions. The entire document is 15
pages long. But here is the key takeaway:
If you’re booking travel or eating out, use a travel card to maximize
rewards. For everything else, use a cash back card.
The card I use for travel and eating out is the Chase Sapphire Reserve.
For everything else, I use an Alliant cash back card. And for business, I use
a Capital One cash back business card. For extra benefits, I have an Amex
Platinum card.
The result of this is thousands of dollars in cash back each year,
millions of rewards points, and a new life motto: MBWOSIS.
My Body Will Only Sleep in Suites.
Don’t go card crazy. Now that you’re in the market, you might be
tempted by any number of card offers. But don’t overdo it. There’s
no magic number of cards you should have, but each additional card
you get means added complexity for your personal finance system:
more to keep track of and more places for things to go wrong. Two
or three is a good rule of thumb. (The average American has four
credit cards.)

My online business profile didn’t have my latest address so I never
received statements. For 34 months, my bank account got charged
$60. I ignored it and didn’t investigate it, hoping it would go away.
I was cocky I could force them to waive these charges because of
the relationship. Then I finally willed myself to look into it, visited
branches, called 5 different departments. No bid. Once all was
said and done, I ended up paying ~$2,000 for a $3,000 initial
balance. It completely smoked my confidence. I closed down all 11
of my cards except my CSP. Technically I’m still “ahead” but the
thought of having paid $2,000 when I *didn’t have to* and it was
*100% avoidable and in my control* was too much.
—HASSAN AHMED, 36
Remember, there are other sources of credit besides credit cards.
These include installment loans (such as auto loans), personal lines of
credit, home equity lines of credit, and service credit (such as utilities).
Your credit score is based on your overall sources of credit. “Take it slow,”
Craig Watts of Fair Isaac Corporation says, cautioning against prescribing
a specific number of credit sources. “It depends on how long you’ve been
managing credit. The less information in your credit report, the higher
the prominence of each new report. For example, if . . . you only have one
credit card in your name, when you open another account, the weight of
that action is more than it would be ten years down the line.” In short,
pick two or three great cards, maximize rewards sensibly, and remember
that these cards are just one part of your overall financial infrastructure.
The Six Commandments
of Credit Cards
N
ow it’s time to go on offense and take full advantage of your
cards. You’ll improve your credit while automatically being
rewarded for the purchases you’re already making. Optimizing
your credit is a multistep process. One of the most important factors
is getting out of debt, which we’ll tackle at the end of the chapter. But
first, we’ll set up automatic credit card payments so you never miss a
payment again. Then, we’ll see how to cut fees, get better rewards, and
take everything you can from the credit card companies.

==================================================

Optimize YOur Credit Cards
1. Pay off your credit card regularly. Yeah, we’ve all heard it, but what
you may not know is that your debt payment history represents 35
percent of your credit score—the largest chunk. In fact, the single most
important thing you can do to improve your credit is to pay your bills
on time. Whether you’re paying the full amount of your credit card bill
or risking my wrath by paying just part of it, pay it on time. Lenders like
prompt payers, so don’t give your credit card company the opportunity
to raise your rates and lower your credit score by being a few days late
with your payment. This is a great example of focusing on what will
get you rich, not on what’s sexy. Think about your friends who search
every single website to get the best deals on travel or clothes. They
might be thrilled after saving $10—and they can brag to everyone about
all the special deals they get—but you’ll quietly save thousands by
understanding the invisible importance of credit, paying your bills on
time, and having a better credit score.
Today, most people pay their credit card bills online, but if you haven’t
set up automatic payment yet, log on to your credit card’s website to do
Awful Consequences
If you miss even one payment on your credit card, here are four terrible,
horrible, no good, very bad results you may face:
1. Your credit score can drop more than 100 points, which would add
$227/month to an average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.
2. Your APR can go up to 30 percent.
3. You’ll be charged a late fee, usually around $35.
4. Your late payment can trigger rate increases on your other credit
cards as well, even if you’ve never been late on them. (I find this fact
amazing.)
Don’t get too freaked out: You can recover from the hit to your credit
score, usually within a few months. In fact, if you’re just a few days late with
your payment, you may incur a fee, but it generally won’t be reported to the
credit bureaus. See page 42 to find out what to do if you miss a payment.

so now. Note: Don’t worry if you don’t always have enough money in your
checking account to pay off the full amount on your credit card. You’ll get
a statement from your card company each month before the payment
goes through so that you can adjust your payment as needed.
I totally forgot the due date for my credit card. So not only did
they charge me a late fee, but they charged me interest on that
month’s and the previous month’s purchases. I called up the
customer service line of the card and told them that I had been
a good customer in the past and asked if they could do anything
for me with the fees. The representative removed the late fee and
refunded $20 of the interest charge back to my account. They
returned a total of $59 to me with one phone call.
—ERIC HENRY, 25
2. Try to get fees on your cards waived. This can be a great way to
optimize your credit cards, because your credit card companies will
do all the work for you. Call them using the phone number on the back
of the card and ask if you’re paying any fees, including annual fees or
service charges. It should go a little something like this:
YOU: Hi, I’d like to confirm that I’m not paying any fees on my credit
card.
CREDIT CARD REP: Well, it looks like you have an annual fee of $100.
That’s actually one of our better rates.
YOU: I’d rather pay no fees. Can you waive this year’s annual fee?
Earlier I mentioned that it can be worth paying annual fees for
rewards cards. This is true—but why not ask? Remember, credit card
companies compete ferociously with each other, which can benefit you.
Call them a month before your new annual fee kicks in and ask them to
waive it. Sometimes it works, sometimes not.
If you decide that your credit card fee isn’t worth it, ask your credit
card company what they’ll do for you. If they waive your fees, great! If
not, switch to a no-fee card. I suggest you do this at the same credit
card company to simplify your life—and so you don’t have to close one
account and open another, which will temporarily affect your credit score.

3. Negotiate a lower APR. Your APR, or annual percentage rate, is the
interest rate your credit card company charges you. APRs fluctuate, but
in general, they hover around 13 to 16 percent. That is very high! This
makes it extremely expensive if you carry a balance on your card. Put
another way, since you can make an average of about 8 percent in the
stock market, your credit card is getting a great deal by lending you
money. If you could get a 14 percent return, you’d be thrilled. You want
to avoid the black hole of credit card interest payments so you can earn
money, not give it to the credit card companies.
So, call your credit card company and ask them to lower your APR.
If they ask why, tell them you’ve been paying your bill in full on time for
the last few months, and you know there are a number of credit cards
offering better rates than you’re currently getting. (See page 64 for a
sample script.) In my experience, this works about half the time.
It’s important to note that your APR doesn’t technically matter if
you’re paying your bills in full every month—you could have a 2 percent
APR or 80 percent APR and it would be irrelevant, since you don’t pay
interest if you pay your total bill each month. But this is a quick and easy
way to pick the low-hanging fruit with one phone call.
Reading IWT, I’ve probably saved $15,000 to $25,000 in interest
alone. I’ve negotiated car loans, student loans, home loans, etc.
—LYLA NUTT, 30
4. Keep your main cards for a long time, and keep them active—but
also keep them simple. Lenders like to see a long history of credit,
which means that the longer you hold an account, the more valuable it
is for your credit score. Don’t get suckered by introductory offers and
low APRs—if you’re happy with your card, keep it. Some credit card
companies will cancel your account after a certain period of inactivity.
To avoid having a card you rarely use shut down, set up an automatic
payment on it. For example, I set it up so that one of my credit cards
pays a $12.95 monthly subscription through my checking account each
month, which requires zero intervention on my part. But my credit report
reflects that I’ve had the card for more than five years, which improves
my credit score. Play it safe: If you have a credit card, keep it active

What to Do If You Miss a Payment
Nobody’s perfect. Despite my warnings, I understand that accidents
happen and you might miss a payment at some point. When this
happens, I use my Indian heritage to beat the companies by negotiating
with them, and you can, too:
YOU: Hi, I noticed I missed a payment, and I wanted to confirm that this
won’t affect my credit score.
CREDIT CARD REP: Let me check on that. No, the late fee will be
applied, but it won’t affect your credit score.
(Note: If you pay within a few days of your missed bill, it usually won’t
be reported to the credit agencies. But ask to be sure.)
YOU: Thank you! I’m really happy to hear that. Now, about that fee . . .
I understand I was late, but I’d like to have it waived.
CREDIT CARD REP: Why?
YOU: It was a mistake. It won’t happen again, so I’d like to have the fee
removed.
(Note: Always end your sentence with strength. Don’t say, “Can you
remove this?” Say, “I’d like to have this removed.”) At this point, you have
a better-than-50-percent chance of getting the fee credited to your
account. But just in case you get an especially tough rep, try this.
CREDIT CARD REP: I’m very sorry, but we can’t refund that fee. I can
try to get you our latest blah blah marketing pitch blah blah . . .
YOU: I’m sorry, but I’ve been a customer for four years and I’d hate for
this one fee to drive me away from your service. What can you do to
remove the late fee?
CREDIT CARD REP: Hmm . . . Let me check on that . . . Yes, I was able
to remove the fee this time. It’s been credited to your account.
You don’t believe me that it can be so simple? It is. Anyone can do it.

using an automatic payment at least once every three months.
Now the one tricky part: If you decide to get a new card, should
you close your old card? I’ve changed my view here over the years.
The typical advice is to keep cards open for as long as possible, which
is generally smart. But if you have lots of cards that you never use,
reconsider this. Some of my readers have opened over twenty-plus
cards to “churn” rewards, and now they can’t keep track of all their
cards. This is where you have to make a decision on risk versus reward
and simplicity versus complexity. There’s lots of advice warning against
closing credit cards, but as long as you’re paying your balances on time
and have good credit, closing an old card will not have a major long-term
impact on your credit score.
Think balance: For most people, having two or three credit cards is
perfect. If you have a special reason to have more cards—for example, if
you own a business or are intentionally maximizing temporary sign-up
rewards—great. But if you find yourself swamped with the number
of cards you have, close the inactive ones. As long as you have good
credit, the long-term impact will be minimal and you’ll sleep easier at
night with a simple financial system you can easily keep track of.
5. Get more credit. (Warning! Do this only if you have no debt.) This
one is counterintuitive, and to explain it, I have to reach into personal
finance lessons of yore. Many people don’t realize this, but in the classic
’80s Salt-N-Pepa song “Push It,” when they say that the dance isn’t for
everybody—“only the sexy people”—they are actually detailing a sound
personal finance strategy.
Before I explain, I want to first acknowledge that, yes, I did just
quote Salt-N-Pepa in an actual, published book. Anyway, when Salt-N-
Pepa talk about “only the sexy people,” what they really mean is “This
tip is only for the financially responsible people.” I’m serious about this
warning: This tip is only for people who have no credit card debt and pay
their bills in full each month. It’s not for anyone else.
It involves getting more credit to improve something called your
credit utilization rate, which is simply how much you owe divided
by your available credit. This makes up 30 percent of your credit
score. For example, if you owe $4,000 and have $4,000 in total
available credit, your ratio is 100 percent (($4,000/$4,000) x 100),
which is bad. If, however, you owe only $1,000 but have $4,000 in
43

                     PAGE 54                      
==================================================

I Will Teach You to Be Rich
available credit, your credit utilization rate is a much better 25 percent
(($1,000 / $4,000) x 100). Lower is preferred because lenders don’t
want you regularly spending all the money you have available through
credit—it’s too likely that you’ll default and not pay them anything.
To improve your credit utilization rate, you have two choices: Stop
carrying so much debt on your credit cards (even if you pay it off each
month) or increase your total available credit. Because we’ve already
established that if you’re doing this, you’re debt-free, all that remains
for you to do is to increase your available credit.
Here’s how: Call up your card company and ask for a credit increase.
YOU: Hi, I’d like to request a credit increase. I currently have five
thousand dollars available, and I’d like ten thousand.
CREDIT CARD REP: Why are you requesting a credit increase?
YOU: I’ve been paying my bill in full for the last eighteen months and I
have some upcoming purchases. I’d like a credit limit of ten thousand
dollars. Can you approve my request?
REP: Sure. I’ve put in a request for this increase. It should be activated
in about seven days.
I request a credit-limit increase every six to twelve months. Remember,
30 percent of your credit score is represented by your credit utilization rate.
To improve it, the first thing you should do is pay off your debt. Only after
you’ve already paid off your debt should you try to increase your available
credit. Sorry to repeat myself, but this is important!
When my husband and I were in college, we got a free T-shirt or
something and got credit cards with reasonable limits ($500).
Sure, I had no income, but that didn’t seem important at the time.
Wouldn’t you know it, I was responsible enough to have my limit
raised to $2,000 after a very short period of time! Except that
I wasn’t actually responsible, and I paid thousands of dollars in
interest and late fees and wrecked my credit rating for several
years. It took many years for us to clear up this debt. I can’t name
one purchase that was truly necessary.

6. Use your credit card’s secret perks! Before I get into rewards programs,
let me say this: Just like with car insurance, you can get great deals on
your credit when you’re a responsible customer. In fact, there are lots of
tips for people who have very good credit. If you fall in this category, you
should call your credit cards and lenders once a year to ask them what
advantages you’re eligible for. Often, they can waive fees, extend credit,
and give you private promotions that others don’t have access to. Call
them up and use this line:
“Hi there. I checked my credit and noticed that I have a 750 credit
score, which is pretty good. I’ve been a customer of yours for the last
four years, so I’m wondering what special promotions and offers you
have for me . . . I’m thinking of fee waivers and special offers that you
use for customer retention.”
As discussed, credit cards also offer rewards programs that give you
cash back, airline tickets, and other benefits, but most people don’t
take advantage of all the free stuff they can get. For example, when I
had to fly to a wedding in an obscure town in Wisconsin, I redeemed my
credit card’s travel reward to save more than $600 on the flight. That’s
an easy example, but there are even more rewards: Did you know that
credit cards automatically give you amazing consumer protection? Here
are a few examples you might not know about:
n Automatic warranty doubling: Most cards extend the warranty
on your purchases. So if you buy an iPhone and it breaks after
Apple’s warranty expires, your credit card will still cover it up to an
additional year. This is true for nearly every credit card for nearly
every purchase, automatically.
n Car rental insurance: If you rent a car, don’t let them sell you on
getting the extra collision insurance. It’s completely worthless!
You already have coverage through your existing car insurance,
plus your credit card will usually back you up to $50,000.
n Trip-cancellation insurance: If you book tickets for a vacation and
then get sick and can’t travel, your airline will charge you hefty
fees to rebook your ticket. Just call your credit card and ask for
the trip-cancellation insurance to kick in, and they’ll cover those
change fees—usually between $3,000 to $10,000 per trip.

                     PAGE 56                      
==================================================

I Will Teach You to Be Rich
n Concierge services: When I couldn’t find LA Philharmonic tickets, I
called my credit card and asked the concierge to try to find some.
He called me back in two days with tickets. They charged me (a lot,
actually), but he was able to get them when nobody else could.
Most important, your credit card automatically tracks your spending,
making it easy for software to download and categorize your expenses.
For these reasons, I put almost all my purchases on a credit card—
especially the large ones.
Your key takeaway: Call your credit card company and ask them to
send you a full list of all their rewards. Then use them!
We paid for our entire 3-week honeymoon using points, including
first-class, round-trip direct flights from NYC to Vegas, luxury suite
at the Venetian, luxury car rental and all other accommodations,
attractions, and food (yeah, even food). We literally didn’t spend a
penny (and came home with +$200. Thanks, blackjack!).
—TE ROMEO, 34
My honey and I go to Hawaii and Italy/Europe each year almost
entirely on points. It looks like we are living large and lavish, but
our last 9-day trip to Italy cost us $350, and that was only because
our favorite hotel in Sienna doesn’t take any points.
—ROBYN GINNEY, 45
Mistakes to Avoid
Think ahead before closing accounts. If you’re applying for a major
loan—for a car, home, or education—don’t close any accounts within
six months of filing the loan application. You want as much credit as
possible when you apply.
However, if you know that an open account will entice you to spend
and you want to close your credit card to prevent that, you should do
it. You may take a slight hit on your credit score, but over time, it will
recover—and that’s better than overspending.

Always Track Your Calls to
Financial Companies
Unfortunately for you, credit card companies are very good at using
BS late fees to increase their revenues. Unfortunately for them,
I’m giving you a script for getting these fees reversed (see page 42).
One of the best ways to improve your chances of having fees waived
is by keeping track of every call to your financial institutions, including
credit card companies, banks, and investment companies. When I call to
dispute anything, I open a spreadsheet that details the last time I called
them, whom I spoke with, and what was resolved. If only criminals were as
diligent as I am.
Create a spreadsheet that looks like this:
The Pocket Tracker for Tracking Credit Card Calls
Call Date Time Name of Rep Rep’s ID# Comments
Whenever you make a call regarding a dispute on your bill, you
wouldn’t believe how powerful it is to refer back to the last time you
called—citing the rep’s name, the date of the conversation, and your call
notes. Most credit card reps you talk to will simply give in because they
know you came to play in the big leagues.
When you use this to confront a credit card company or bank with
data from your last calls, you’ll be more prepared than 99 percent of other
people—and chances are, you’ll get what you want.

Disputing a Charge:
How to Mobilize Your Credit Card’s
Army for You
Once, when I canceled my cell phone service, they told me my
account had a $160 charge. “For what?” I asked. Wait for it . . .
“An early cancellation fee.”
Yeah, right. I knew I didn’t have a contract, and I had negotiated out of
an early cancellation fee a long time before that. (Cell phone companies
make a lot of money from trying these shady moves, hoping customers
will get frustrated, give up, and just pay.) But I’m not the one to try this
on: Ever since the company had started trying to rip me off three years
before, I had kept records of every phone conversation I’d had with them.
The customer service rep was very polite, but insisted she couldn’t do
anything to erase the charge.
Really? I’d heard this tune before, so I pulled out the notes I had taken
the previous year and politely read them aloud to her.
As soon as I read them, I experienced a miraculous change in her
ability to waive the fee. Within two minutes, my account was cleared and I
was off the phone. Amazing!!!!! Thank you, madam!!!
Wouldn’t it be great if that were the end of the story? I wish. They told
me they wouldn’t charge me . . . and they did it anyway. By this point, I was
so fed up that I called in the big guns.
Many people don’t know that credit cards offer excellent consumer
protection. This is one reason I encourage everyone to make major
purchases on their credit card (and not use cash or a debit card).
I called my credit card company and told them I wanted to dispute a
charge. They said, “Sure, what’s your address and what’s the amount?”
When I told them about my experience with the cell phone company, they
instantly gave me a temporary credit for the amount and told me to mail
in a form with my complaint, which I did.
Two weeks later, the complaint was resolved in my favor.
What happens in disputes like this is the credit card company fights
the merchant for you. This works with all credit cards. Keep this in mind
for future purchases that go wrong.

Manage debt to avoid damaging your credit score. “If you close an
account but pay off enough debt to keep your credit utilization score
the same,” says Craig Watts of FICO, “your score won’t be affected.” For
example, if you carry $1,000 debt on two credit cards with a credit limit
of $2,500 on each, your credit utilization rate is 20 percent ($1,000 debt,
$5,000 total credit available). If you close one of the cards, suddenly your
credit utilization rate jumps to 40 percent ($1,000, $2,500). But if you pay
off $500 in debt, your utilization rate would be 20 percent ($500, $2,500),
and your score would not change.
Don’t play the zero percent transfer game. Some people have started
playing the zero percent transfer game to profit off credit cards by
making balance transfers or taking cash advances. They take the
introductory zero percent APR that you get when you open many credit
cards (which usually only lasts for six months). Then they borrow money
from the card at this low rate and stick it in a high-interest savings
account, which allows them to profit off the interest. Some actually
invest the money in short-term CDs or even stocks. At the end, they
plan to return the money and keep the interest. I find these zero percent
credit card games to be a huge waste of time. Sure, you can make a
few bucks a year, or maybe even a few hundred, but the time, risk of
Oh No! My Credit Score Dropped
Some of my type A readers worry too much about their credit scores.
If your credit score suddenly drops, first you should figure out why by
getting a copy of your credit report and score (see page 30). Then what’s
important is how you deal with it going forward. Your credit score can
start recovering immediately as more positive information is reported,
like that you’ve been paying your bills on time. So work to manage your
credit wisely and consistently. As FICO’s Craig Watts notes, “The natural
movement of these scores is to slowly grow. How do you think people
end up with scores in the mid-800s? It’s through years and years of
consistently boring credit management.”

mismanaging the process, and possibility of screwing up your credit
score just aren’t worth it. Most important, this is a distraction that gets
you only short-term results. You’re much better off building a personal
finance infrastructure that focuses on long-term growth, not on getting
a few bucks here or there. Dave Ramsey, a popular personal finance
author and radio host, specializes in helping people get out of debt.
Rate Chasers:
Wasting Time Earning $25/Month
One of my blog readers, a guy named Mike, wrote in to tell me about
his rate chasing. In this case, it was savings accounts, not credit
cards, but they’re very similar: It’s just moving money around from one
account to another to eke out a few additional percentage points.
Mike admitted, “I’m one of those rate chasers, so [with $40,000 in
emergency savings] I’ve consistently been earning anywhere between
0.65 and 0.85 percent higher than my operating money market account . . .
That’s an extra $300/year in interest, which is definitely worth changing
banks every four to six months for me.”
My response: “Mike, if you were smart enough to sock away $40,000
in an emergency fund (which is really impressive, by the way), I bet you’re
smart enough to spend your time doing something better than earning
$300/year—something that will let you earn much more sustainably.
You’re only earning $0.82/day doing that! How about spending the same
time optimizing your asset allocation? (See page 226.) That step alone is
probably worth thousands per year. Or starting a side business? Or even
spending those few hours with your family? I don’t know what you value,
but in my eyes, any of those things would produce more value than $300/
year . . . especially for someone who’s so far ahead of everyone else, like
you are. This is just my two cents . . . about 1/40th of what you earned
today (sorry, couldn’t resist).”
Focus on the Big Wins to get the big results. They may not be as
obvious or sexy as jumping from account to account and getting a few
extra bucks, but the Big Wins will make you rich over the long term.

financial counselor, and I have never met one who said he made it all

Debt, Debt, Debt
S
tatistically speaking, being in debt is “normal.” And yet, think
about it: Is it really normal to owe more than you have? Maybe for
certain things, like a house or an education, but what about for
random purchases on a credit card?
Some people differentiate debts by calling them “good debt”
and “bad debt,” depending on if the debt appreciates (education) or
depreciates (car) over time. Others despise debt altogether. Whatever
the case, most of us have a lot of it. And it doesn’t feel good.
I want to talk about student loans and credit card debt, the two
largest types of debt facing most people. To do that, let’s start by
tackling the obvious: We already know debt is bad. In fact, we already
know what to do about it. So what’s stopping us? The answer isn’t just
“money,” it’s psychology.
We Know What to Do. So Why Don’t We
Do It?
I can give you all the information on earth about credit, but until you
master your money psychology, none of it makes a difference. That’s
why so many people “know” all of this information, but they’re still
drowning in debt or sticking with poor cards that cost them thousands
in fees and lost rewards.
What’s stopping them? It’s not knowledge—it’s something else.
Dr. Brad Klontz (yourmentalwealth.com), a professor in financial
psychology, coined the term “invisible money scripts” to describe
“typically unconscious, trans-generational beliefs about money”
that are developed in childhood and drive your behavior today.
These beliefs are incredibly powerful, and once you recognize
them in yourselves, you might understand your own behavior better.
Here are some of the most common invisible money scripts
around debt.

debt do not know how much they actually owe.
The truth would be too painful, so they ignore it.
But there is power in acknowledging the problem
and making a plan.

“Life happens to me” rather than acknowledging

Damn, that got depressing. But I included these examples to show
you how insidious and powerful these invisible money scripts are.
These invisible money scripts turn into very peculiar behaviors.
People “know” they’re not handling their money the right way, but
they continue doing what they’ve done for years on end. To the outside
observer, this can seem puzzling: “You’re in debt! Why are you spending
$800 on that weekend trip?”
But people are not purely rational. In fact, these invisible money
People Don’t Know
How Much Debt They’re In
“It would appear that Americans don’t even know how much they
owe,” Binyamin Appelbaum of the New York Times wrote. “Only 50
percent of households reported any credit card debt, while credit card
companies reported that 76 percent of households owed them money.”
It seems hard to believe, but in my experience, most people have
no idea how much they actually owe. I get dozens of emails every day
from people in debt. When I ask them how much they owe, fewer than
25 percent know. When I ask what their debt payoff date is, 95 percent of
people don’t know.
I have a lot of compassion for people in debt. Some are in tough life
situations. Some don’t understand how credit cards work. Some people
have debt spread out over multiple credit cards and student loan
accounts. Almost everyone is trying to do their best.
But I have no sympathy for people who complain without a plan. And a
plan means that if you’re in debt, you should know how much you owe and
the exact day your debt will be paid off. Almost nobody does.
A plan turns debt from a “hot” emotional topic to a “cool” math
problem. As I say in the business class I teach, “It’s not magic, it’s math.”
Same for building a business, same for paying off debt.
Most of all, a plan gives you control. It might take you three months to
pay off your debt. It might be ten years! But once you have a plan, and you
use the rest of this book to automate your plan, you’ll know you’re on track
to live a Rich Life. I’ll show you how.

scripts explain why so many people in debt avoid opening their mail.
You might say, “JUST OPEN YOUR BILLS! PAY IT OFF! It’s not that hard!”
But if your invisible money scripts have been honed and sharpened by
the stories you tell yourself over more than twenty years (“bills = bad”),
it can be hard to change. My goal with this book is to show you that you
can change your money stories.
What are the stories you’ve told yourself about debt?
The Burden of Student Loans
I’m not going to lie to you: Getting rid of student loan debt is hard.
The average student graduates with about $30,000 of debt, but lots
of my friends have graduated with more than $100,000 in loans.
Unfortunately, it’s not like you can just wave a magic wand and make
it disappear. In fact, even if you declare bankruptcy, you’ll still have to
pay your student loans. However, even if you have huge student debt,
I want you to pay attention to how much money you’re putting toward
the monthly payments. Because the loan amounts are so large, even an
extra $100/month can save you years of payments.
Let’s look at an example. My friend Tony has $30,000 in student
loan debt. If he pays off the loan over ten years, his monthly payment
will be about $345.24/month, meaning he’ll pay just over $11,428.97
in interest. But if he pays just $100 more/month, he’ll have to pay only
$7,897.77 in interest—and he’ll pay off his loan in 7.2 years.
Most of us accept our student debt as is. We get a bill each month,
we pay it, and we shrug, frustrated about the burden of our loans but
not really sure if we can do anything. Guess what: You can change your
student loan payments.
First, to inspire you to take action on paying off your student debt,
play with the financial calculators at bankrate.com. You’ll be able to see
how paying different amounts changes the total amount you’ll owe.
Second, I want to encourage you to put at least $50 more each
month toward any debt you have. Not only is it a psychological victory
to know that you’re consciously working to pay off your debt, but you’ll
also be able to focus on investing sooner. Make sure this is automatic,
drawing right out of your checking account, so you don’t even see the
money. (I describe automatic payments in Chapter 5.)

The Most Common Internet
Comments About Saving and Debt
I’ve seen this conversation happen a million times on some internet
forum.
Someone posts an article about how much money the average person
should have saved at 35 years old, 40 years old, and 50 years old.
It gets 8,000 comments bemoaning capitalism, geopolitics, and baby
boomers.
Helpful Commenter: “Well, you can save 10% and start investi—”
500 Angry Commenters: “LOL! Save? I live in a cardboard box!
There’s no way any of us can save.” (2,000,000 likes)
Helpful Commenter: “Well, you can start with even $20/month.”
Angry Commenters: “Maybe YOU can save $20/month. I can’t even
spare 50 cents per year.”
Helpful Commenter: “I’m sorry to hear that. Anyway, when I started
saving a little bit, I took some of it and invested. If you assume 8%, that
means after a few year—”
Angry Commenters: “8%??? LOL! Yeah, I’d looove to get 8%.
I invested in a landfill and got 0.0000023% over the last nine years. Haha,
8%, yeah right.”
Helpful Commenter: “Um, the S&P 500 has returned an average
of 8%, including inflation. And you can invest directly in the market with
index funds.”
Angry Commenters: “What? Really? Can you send me a link for
where I can find out more about that?”
These people spend their time complaining on internet forums and
spend decades paying thousands of dollars in interest. But they’ve never
read a single book about personal finance. You can do better.

Finally, if you find that, no matter how you run the numbers, you’re
not going to be able to pay your loan off in any reasonable amount of
time, it’s time to call your lender. Look at the phone number on that
monthly bill you keep ignoring. Call them up and ask them for their
advice. I can’t emphasize this enough: Call them. Your lenders have
heard it all, from “I can’t pay this month” to “I have five different loans
and want to consolidate them.” You’ll want to ask them the following:
n “What would happen if I paid $100 more per month?” (Substitute
in the right amount for you.)
n “What would happen if I changed the timeline of the loan from five
years to fifteen years?”
n If you’re looking for a job, you might ask, “What if I’m looking for a
job and can’t afford to pay for the next three months?”
Your lender has answers to all these questions—and chances are
they can help you find a better way to structure your payment. Typically,
they’ll help you by changing the monthly payment or the timeline. Just
think: With that one call, you could save thousands of dollars.
I refinanced $10,000 in private student loans, reducing the
interest rates from 8% to 6%, which will save me about $2,000
over the life of the loan.
—DAN BULLMAN, 28
I called in to Navient and changed my student loans from 20-year
to 10-year loans. I had no idea the difference, and it ended up
saving me over $10,000 . . . just by paying an extra $50 a month.

“The Moment I Realized
I Could Pay Off My Debt”
I asked my readers about the moment when they realized they could pay
off their debt. Here’s what just a handful of them said.
The major turning point for me was when I got serious with my
girlfriend. She made about a third of what I made, but she had
about a year’s salary saved up. I was ashamed to have $40,000
in debt, so I started applying the IWT principles to pay down
debt and accomplished that inside two years.
—SEAN WILKINS, 39
Debt was something I had got “used to”—my lifestyle was short-
term and reactive rather than planned. I was so used to living
paycheck to paycheck, I hadn’t experienced the freedom of
being able to make conscious financial choices. Now money is a
tool, not my slave master.
—DAVE VINTON, 34
Oh man, debt absolutely SUCKED. I remember crying about it
(multiple times). I had debt for all of in-state college, my $9,000
boob job, my $3,000 mattress, and my daily mall shopping spree
habits. I was so unhappy and clueless. When I chose to turn my life
around, your book was one of the first I bought, and it really woke
me the hell up. I felt wealth coming into my life just by reading it,
haha. I am now completely debt-free and started a Roth IRA.
—STEPHANIE GANOWSKI, 27
I lacked confidence and felt like it was holding me back from
taking advantage of all life has to offer. After reading IWT (and
now living debt-free!), I have more confidence and spend money
on experiences, people, and possessions that I value.

how to solve their problems when the answers are so clear: “Yes, you
should leave him! He hasn’t had a job for the last eight years! And he
looks like a rat. Are you blind?” But when we have our own problems, the
answers don’t seem so simple. What should you do? How do you manage
your day-to-day finances? And why do things keep getting worse? The good
news is that credit card debt is almost always manageable if you have a
plan and take disciplined steps to reduce it.
Now, almost nothing makes people feel guiltier than having
credit card debt. Seventy-five percent of Americans claim they don’t
make major purchases on their credit card unless they can pay it off
immediately. Yet from looking at actual spending behaviors, over 70
percent of Americans carry a balance, and fewer than half are willing to
reveal their credit card debt to a friend. Those numbers are an indication
that American consumers are ashamed of their debt levels, says Greg
McBride, senior vice president, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. He
told me, “They are more willing to give their name, age, and even details
of their sex lives than provide the amount of their credit card debt.”
Really? Their sex lives? If this is you, let me know. I have a few single
friends who’d like to meet you.
This shame means that those in debt often don’t educate themselves
on how to stop the madness. Instead, they fall victim to the credit card
companies’ nefarious practices, which prey on the uninformed—and the
undisciplined. These companies have become very good at extracting more
money from us, and we’ve become very bad at knowing enough to say no.
For instance, the number one mistake people make with their
credit cards is carrying a balance, or not paying it off every month.
Astonishingly, of the 125 million Americans who carry a monthly credit
card balance, half of them pay only their minimum monthly payments.
Sure, it’s tempting to think that you can buy something and pay it off
little by little, but because of credit cards’ insanely high interest rates,
that’s a critical mistake.
Let’s say it again: The key to using credit cards effectively is to pay
off your credit card in full every month. I know I said that casually, in the
same way someone would ask you to pass the salt, but it’s important.
Ask your friend with $12,000 in credit card debt how it happened.
Chances are he’ll shrug and tell you he decided to “just pay the
minimum” every month.

I used my credit cards for everything and paid the monthly
minimums. That plan left me with maxed-out cards. I opened new
0% balance transfers to try to pay down the debts. Since I was so
far over my head and didn’t have any emergency cash funds, I
used the credit cards I had to pay for things I truly needed. I wound
up owing pretty much every major creditor you can think of, and
still do.
The interest on my debt crushed me. Just because you have
room on the card doesn’t mean you have room in your budget!!!!
—DAVID THOMAS, 32
I’m not going to belabor the point, but you would be shocked by
how many people I talk to who charge purchases without knowing how
much they’ll actually end up paying once interest is figured in. Paying
the minimum amount on your credit card is the grown-up equivalent of
a little boy letting the school bully take his lunch money on the first day
of school, then coming back with his pockets jingling every single day
afterward. Not only are you going to get your ass kicked, but it’s going
to happen again and again. By learning how the system works, though,
you can figure out how to avoid the card companies’ traps and get out of
debt more quickly.
Pay Your Debt Off Aggressively
If you’ve found yourself in credit card debt—whether it’s a lot or a little—
you have a triple whammy working against you:
n First, you’re paying tons of high interest on the balance you’re
carrying.
n Second, your credit score suffers—30 percent of your credit score is
based on how much debt you have—putting you into a downward
spiral of trying to get credit to get a house, car, or apartment and
having to pay even more because of your poor credit.
n Third, and potentially most damaging, debt can affect you
emotionally. It can overwhelm you, leading you to avoid opening
your bills, causing more late payments and more debt, in a vicious
circle of doom.

It’s time to make sacrifices to pay off your debt quickly. Otherwise,
you’re costing yourself more and more every day. Don’t put it off,
because there’s not going to be a magic day when you win a million
dollars or “have enough time” to figure out your finances. You said that
three years ago! Managing your money has to be a priority if you ever
want to be in a better situation than you are in today.
Think about it: Credit cards’ high interest rates mean you’re likely
paying a tremendous amount of interest on any balance you’re carrying.
Let’s assume someone has $5,000 in debt on a card with 14 percent
APR. If Dumb Dan pays the 2 percent monthly minimum payment, it will
take him more than twenty-five years to pay off this debt. No, that’s not
a typo—it’s really twenty-five years! Over the entire process, he’ll pay
over $6,000 in interest, more than the original amount he spent. And
that’s assuming he doesn’t rack up more debt, which you know he will.
If you’re outraged, you should be: This is how people can spend their
entire lives in credit card debt. You can do better.
Smart Sally, by contrast, is sick of her debt and decides to get
aggressive about paying it off. She has a few options: If she pays a fixed
amount of $100 per month, she’ll pay about $2,500 in interest, making
her debt-free in six years and 4 months. This shows why you should
always pay more than the minimum on your credit card. There’s also
an added benefit to doing that: It fits in beautifully to your automation
system, explained in Chapter 5.
Or maybe Smart Sally decides to pay a little more — let’s say $200
per month. Now it takes her 2.5 years to pay off her debt, including
about $950 in interest payments. All from a tweak to her payments.
Or what if Smart Sally gets truly aggressive and pays $400 per month?
Now she’ll pay off her debt in one year and two months, totaling just
over $400 in interest payments.
That’s just from paying $100 or $200 more per month. Don’t have $200
extra? How about $50? Or even $20? Even a tiny increase in how much you
pay every month can dramatically shorten your time to being debt free.
If you set up automatic payments (which I discuss on page 39)
and work your debt down, you won’t pay fees anymore. You won’t pay
finance charges. You’ll be free to grow your money by looking ahead.
In the credit card companies’ eyes, you’ll be a “deadbeat,” a curious
nickname they actually use for customers who pay on time every month
and therefore produce virtually no revenue. You’ll be worthless in their

eyes, which is perfect in mine. But to beat them, you have to prioritize
paying off whatever you already owe.
I spent four years in college racking up debt that I was certain
I’d pay off easily once I started working. I spring-breaked in Las
Vegas, Mexico, and Miami. I bought Manolo Blahnik shoes. I went
out several nights a week. I had no idea then that I’d spend five
post-college years paying that debt off—five years in which I could
not vacation, could not buy fancy shoes, and could not go out
very much at all. So on the day when I sent my final payment to
my credit card company, I decided that that payment would be my
last. I promised myself that I would never go back into debt again.

minimum on your credit card debt.
**This is a fixed amount. As your balance decreases, you continue to pay the fixed amount, which
speeds your debt payoff, costing you less.

I Will Teach You to Be Rich
Five Steps to Getting Rid
of Credit Card Debt
N
ow that you see the benefits of climbing out of debt as quickly
as possible, let’s look at some concrete steps you can take to
get started. I Will Teach You to Be Rich is a six-week program, but
obviously paying off your loans will take longer than that. Even if you’re
carrying debt, you should still read the rest of the book now, because
there are important lessons on automating your finances and getting
conscious about your spending. Just keep in mind that you won’t be able
to invest as aggressively as I recommend until you pay off your debt.
Yeah, it sucks, but that’s a reasonable cost to pay for incurring your
debt. Now, here’s what to do.
1. Figure out how much debt you have. You wouldn’t believe how many
people don’t do this and continue blindly paying off any bills that come
in with no strategic plan. This is exactly what the credit card companies
want, because you’re essentially just dumping money into their pockets.
You can’t make a plan to pay off your debt until you know exactly how
much you owe. It might be painful to learn the truth, but you have to bite
the bullet. Then you’ll see that it’s not hard to end this bad habit. In fact,
you can get the credit card companies to help you: Look at the back of
your credit cards for their numbers, call them, and put their answers into
a simple spreadsheet like this one.

Optimize YOur Credit Cards
Congratulations! The first step is the hardest. Now you have a
definitive list of exactly how much you owe.
2. Decide what to pay off first. Not all debts are created equal. Different
cards charge you different interest rates, which can affect what you
decide to pay off first. There are two schools of thought on how to go
about this. In the standard method, you pay the minimums on all cards,
but pay more money to the card with the highest APR, because it’s
costing you the most. In the Dave Ramsey snowball method, you pay the
minimums on all cards, but pay more money to the card with the lowest
balance first—the one that will allow you to pay it off first.

more motivated to pay off
the next one.
This is a source of fierce debate in credit card circles. Technically, the
snowball method isn’t necessarily the most efficient approach, because
the card with the lowest balance doesn’t necessarily have the highest
APR. But on a psychological level, it’s enormously rewarding to see one
credit card paid off, which in turn can motivate you to pay off others
more quickly. Bottom line: Don’t spend more than five minutes deciding.
Just pick one method and do it. The goal is not to optimize your payoff
method, but to get started paying off your debt.

I Will Teach You to Be Rich
I’ve saved over $3,000 and paid off over $3,000 in credit card
debt. The idea of snowballing payments from the smallest card to
the largest had the greatest impact on my mentality toward paying
off the debt.
—SEAN STEWART, 31
3.Negotiate down the APR. I’m a huge fan of taking fifty-fifty odds if the
upside is big and it takes only five minutes of my time. Accordingly, try
negotiating down your APR. It works surprisingly often, and if it doesn’t,
so what? Just call your card companies and follow this script:
YOU: Hi. I’m going to be paying off my credit card debt more
aggressively beginning next week, and I’d like a lower APR.
CREDIT CARD REP: Uh, why?
YOU: I’ve decided to be more aggressive about paying off my debt, and
that’s why I’d like a lower APR. Other cards are offering me rates at half
of what you’re offering. Can you lower my rate by 50 percent, or only 40
percent?
CREDIT CARD REP: Hmm . . . After reviewing your account, I’m afraid
we can’t offer you a lower APR. We can offer you a credit limit increase,
however.
YOU: No, that won’t work for me. Like I mentioned, other credit cards
are offering me zero percent introductory rates for twelve months, as
well as APRs of half what you’re offering. I’ve been a customer for X
years, and I’d prefer not to switch my balance over to a low-interest card.
Can you match the other credit card rates, or can you go lower?
CREDIT CARD REP: I see . . . Hmm, let me pull something up here.
Fortunately, the system is suddenly letting me offer you a reduced APR.
That is effective immediately.
It doesn’t work every time, but when it does, you can save a
significant amount of money with a five-minute conversation. Make the
call, and if you’re successful, don’t forget to recalculate the figures in
your debt spreadsheet.

I literally called my credit card company in the bookstore at the
airport BEFORE buying the book, read the script, and was able to
negotiate a better APR. And they even credited the interest for the
last few years back to my account (only a few hundred bucks, but
STILL). I bought the book seconds after hanging up.
—CHRIS COLETTI, 33
That first week I practiced my script, then called up my credit cards
and had my rate dropped from 18 percent to 11 percent.

Debt was awful. It felt like a cloud over me at all times. I started
contributing $100 more than the minimums and crushed that shit.
I still have my ‘paid in full’ notices saved.
—MATT GROVES, 31
4.Decide where the money to pay off your credit cards will come from.
One common barrier to paying off debt is wondering where the money
should come from. Balance transfers? Should you use your 401(k) money
or your savings account? How much should you be paying off every
month? These questions can be daunting, but don’t let them stop you.
nB alance transfers. Many people begin by considering a balance
transfer to a card with a lower APR. I’m not a fan of these. Yes, it
can help for a few months and save you some money, particularly
on large balances. But this is just a Band-Aid for a larger problem
(usually your spending behavior, when it comes to credit card
debt), so changing the interest rate isn’t going to address that.
Plus, balance transfers are a confusing process fraught with
tricks by credit card companies to trap you into paying more,
and the people I’ve known who do this end up spending more
time researching the best balance transfers than actually paying
their debt off. As we just discussed, a better option is to call and
negotiate the APR down on your current accounts.

n T aking money from a 401(k) or home equity line of credit (heloc).
I don’t recommend either of these options. You’re trying to reduce
complexity, not increase it, even if it costs slightly more. Again,
there’s the behavioral problem: People with credit card debt often
find it difficult to reduce spending and end up getting back into
debt after tapping their 401(k) or HELOC. If you use your HELOC
money to pay off credit cards, you’ll risk losing your home if you
run up more debt.
n R educing spending and prioritizing debt. The most sustainable
way to pay off credit card debt is also the least sexy. Unlike
balance transfers or HELOC borrowing, it’s not very exciting to tell
people you decided to spend less on other things so you could pay
off your debt. But it works.
Let me ask you a question. Right now, for every $100 you earn,
how much of it goes to debt? Two dollars? Maybe $5? What if you paid
$10 toward your debt? You’d be surprised that many people don’t even
have to cut much spending to pay off debt quickly. They just have to
stop spending on random items, get conscious about making debt
a priority, and set up aggressive automatic transfers to pay off their
credit card debt. I don’t want to make this sound easy, because paying
off your credit card debt is challenging. But millions of others have
done it.
As you read the rest of this book, think of yourself as being on a little
treasure hunt to figure out where to get the money to pay off your credit
card debt. Pay special attention to these discussions:
n “The Next $100” concept on page 171.
n Figuring out how much you can afford to put toward your debt
using the Conscious Spending Plan on page 139.

You’ll notice that I haven’t offered you a simple secret or cute sound
bite about how to pay off your debt with no work. That’s because there
isn’t one. If there were, I would be the first to tell you. But truthfully,
paying off debt just takes a plan and the patience to execute it. It may
seem like pure agony for the first few weeks, but imagine the relief you’ll
feel when you see your debt growing smaller and smaller with each
passing month. And sometime after that, you’ll be debt-free! Then you
can focus all your energy on getting ahead, investing, and living your
Rich Life.
5.Get started. Within the coming week, you should start paying more
money toward your debt. If you find yourself taking more time than
that to get started, you’re overthinking it. Remember the philosophy
behind the 85 Percent Solution: The goal is not to research every last
corner to decide where the money will come from; it’s action. Figure
out how much debt you have, decide how you want to pay it down,
negotiate your rates, and get started. You can always fine-tune your plan
and amount later. I’ll cover more on your Conscious Spending Plan in
Chapter 4.
Being in debt means giving up choices, means staying at a job you
hate because it pays good money, means not being able to build
a decent savings account. My biggest mistake was not thinking
about the future and using credit cards to live beyond my means.
I got myself into debt in my midtwenties by spending, spending,
spending—and on stupid things like clothes, eating out, movies,
etc. I learned my lesson and am now living within my means on a
strict budget that will allow me to be debt-free in two years. All of
my debt is now on cards with APRs between zero and 4.99 percent.
I have a small but growing savings account, a 401(k), and a plan to
achieve financial freedom.

ACTION STEPS 1Get your credit score and credit report (one hour).
WEEK Check them to make sure there are no errors and
ONE to get familiar with your credit. You can access your
report and score at myfico.com. (As I mentioned,
lots of people use Credit Karma to get a free credit
score, but I prefer the official credit score from
MyFico, which is more accurate even though it has a
small fee.) In addition to your credit score, get your
free credit report from annualcreditreport.com.
2Set up your credit card (two hours). If you already have one, call and
make sure it’s a no-fee card. If you want to get a new credit card,
check out bankrate.com to find the best one for you.
3Make sure you’re handling your credit cards effectively (three hours).
Set up automatic payments so your credit card bill is paid off in full
every month. (If you’re in debt, set up an automatic payment for the largest
amount you can afford.) Get your fees waived. Apply for more credit, if
you’re debt-free. Make sure you’re getting the most out of your cards.
4If you have debt, start paying it off (one week to plan, then start paying
more). Not tomorrow, not next week, today: Give yourself one week to
figure out how much you owe, call the lender to negotiate down the APR or
restructure your payments (in the case of student loans), and set up your
automatic payment with more money than you’re paying now. Getting out
of debt quickly will be the best financial decision you ever make.
That’s it! You’ve mastered improving your credit by using your credit
card. You’ve waived your card fees, negotiated your rates down, and
even set up automatic payments. And if you have debt, you’ve taken
the first steps toward paying it all off. Congratulations! In the next
chapter, we’re going to optimize your bank accounts. You’ll earn more
interest, pay no fees, and upgrade to better accounts than the worthless
checking and savings accounts we grew up with. Once you’ve tackled
your credit card and bank accounts, you’ll be ready to start investing—
and growing your money significantly.
