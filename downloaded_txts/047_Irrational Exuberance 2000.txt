Preface
This book is a broad study,
drawing on a wide range of
published research and historical evidence, of the enormous recent
stock market boom. Although it takes as its specific starting point
the current situation, it places that situation in the context of stock
market booms generally, and it also makes concrete suggestions
regarding policy changes that should be initiated in response to
this and other booms.
The need for such a book is particularly urgent today, in view
of the widespread and quite fundamental disagreement about
the stock market. When people disagree at such a basic level, it is
usually because they possess only pieces of the overall picture.Yet
meaningful consensus can only be achieved by laying out all the
available facts. I have therefore tried in this book to present a much
broader range of information than is usually considered in writings
on the market, and I have tried to synthesize this information into
a detailed picture of the market today.
Why did the U.S. stock market reach such high levels by the turn
of the millennium? What changed to cause the market to become
so highly priced? What do these changes mean for the market

outlook in the opening decades of the new millennium? Are pow-
erful fundamental factors at work to keep the market as high as
it is now or to push it even higher, even if there is a downward
correction? Or is the market high only because of some irrational
exuberance—wishful thinking on the part of investors that blinds
us to the truth of our situation?
The answers to these questions are critically important to pri-
vate and public interests alike. How we value the stock market now
and in the future influences major economic and social policy deci-
sions that affect not only investors but also society at large, even
the world. If we exaggerate the present and future value of the stock
market, then as a society we may invest too much in business start-
ups and expansions, and too little in infrastructure, education, and
other forms of human capital. If we think the market is worth more
than it really is, we may become complacent in funding our pen-
sion plans, in maintaining our savings rate, in legislating an
improved Social Security system, and in providing other forms of
social insurance. We might also lose the opportunity to use our
expanding financial technology to devise new solutions to the gen-
uine risks—to our homes, cities, and livelihoods—that we face.
To answer these questions about today’s stock market, I harvest
relevant information from diverse and, some would say, remote
fields of inquiry. Insights from these fields too often go unnoticed
by market analysts, but they have proved critical in defining sim-
ilar market episodes throughout history, as well as in other markets
around the world. These fields include economics, psychology,
demography, sociology, and history. In addition to more conven-
tional modes of financial analysis, they bring potent insights to bear
on the issues at hand. Much of the evidence is drawn from the
emerging field of behavioral finance, which, as the years go by, is
looking less and less like a minor subfield of finance and more and
more like a central pillar of serious finance theory.
I marshal the most important insights offered by researchers in
these fields. Taken as a whole, they suggest that the present stock
market displays the classic features of a speculative bubble:a situ-
ation in which temporarily high prices are sustained largely by
investors’ enthusiasm rather than by consistent estimation of real

value. Under these conditions, even though the market could pos-
sibly maintain or even substantially increase its price level, the out-
look for the stock market into the next ten or twenty years is
likely to be rather poor—and perhaps even dangerous.
I do not purport to present a wholly new conception of finan-
cial market behavior. This book is a work neither of economic theory
nor of econometrics, although it partakes in both. Rather, it is an
attempt to characterize the complex nature of our real markets today,
considering whether they conform or do not conform to our
expectations and models. By assembling the most relevant evidence,
economic and otherwise, on the state of the market, I hope to cor-
rect what I consider to be the perilous policy paths now being fol-
lowed by legislators and economic leaders. I also hope to challenge
financial thinkers to improve their theories by testing them against
the impressive evidence that suggests that the price level is more
than merely the sum of the available economic information, as is
now generally thought to be the case.
Within the past generation the branch of financial theory that is
derived from the assumption that all people are thoroughly ratio-
nal and calculating has become the most influential analytical
device to inform our mastery of the market. Those financial the-
orists who consider the market price to be a cunningly efficient
processor of financial information have had a profound effect on
the systematic management of the world’s wealth, from the cor-
ner stockbroker right up to the Federal Reserve. But most of these
scholars of finance and economics shrink from public statements
about the level of the stock market (although they are often more
loose-lipped in expressing their opinions at lunch and over beers)
because they do not want to be caught saying things in public that
they cannot prove.Assuming the mantle of scientific detachment,
these financial economists tend to fall back on the simple but
elegant model of market efficiency to justify their professional
position.
However, there are serious risks inherent in relying too heavily
on such pristine models as the basis for policy discussion, for these
models deal only with problems that can be answered with scientific
precision. If one tries too hard to be precise, one runs the risk of

xiv PREFACE
being so narrow as to be irrelevant. The evidence I present in the
following chapters suggests that the reality of today’s stock mar-
ket is anything but test-tube clinical. If the theory of finance is
to grow in its usefulness, all economists eventually will have to
grapple with these messier aspects of market reality. Meanwhile,
participants in public debate and economic policy formation must
sort out this tangle of market factors now, before it is too late.
Among the unanticipated consequences of today’s investment
culture is that many of the tens of millions of adults now invested
in the stock market act as if the price level is simply going to keep
rising at its current rate. Even though the stock market appears
based on some measures to be higher than it has ever been,
investors behave as though it can never be too high, and that it
can never go down for long. Why would they behave this way?
Their logic is apparently consistent with the free-rider argument.
That is, if millions of researchers and investors are studying stock
prices and confirming their apparent value, why waste one’s time
in trying to figure out reasonable prices? One might as well take
the free ride at the expense of these other diligent investors who
have investigated stock prices and do what they’re doing—buy
stocks!
But unknown to most investors is the troubling lack of credibility
in the quality of research being done on the stock market, to say
nothing of the clarity and accuracy with which it is communicated
to the public. Some of this so-called research often seems no more
rigorous than the reading of tea leaves. Arguments that the Dow
is going to 36,000 or 40,000 or 100,000 hardly inspire trust. Certainly
someresearchers are thinking more realistically about the market’s
prospects and reaching better-informed positions on its future, but
these are not the names that grab the headlines and thus influence
public attitudes.
Instead the headlines reflect the news media’s constant atten-
tion to trivial factoids and “celebrity” opinion about the market’s
price level. Driven as their authors are by competition for readers,
listeners, and viewers, media accounts tend to be superficial and
thus to encourage basic misconceptions about the market. Acon-
ventional wisdom of sorts, stressing the seemingly eternal dura-

bility of stocks, has emerged from these media accounts. The pub-
lic has learned to accept this conventional—but in my view shal-
low—wisdom. To be fair to the Wall Street professionals whose
views appear in the media, it is difficult for them to correct the
conventional wisdom because they are limited by the blurbs and
sound bites afforded them. One would need to write books to
straighten these things out. This is such a book.
As noted earlier, the conventional wisdom holds that the stock
market as a whole has always been the best investment, and always
will be, even when the market is overpriced by historical standards.
Small investors, in their retirement funds, are increasingly shift-
ing their investments toward stocks, and the investment policy of
100% stocks in retirement funds is increasingly popular. They put
their money where their mantra is. This attitude invites exploita-
tion by companies who have an unlimited supply of equities to sell.
“You want stocks? We’ll give you stocks.”
Most investors also seem to view the stock market as a force of
nature unto itself. They do not fully realize that they themselves,
as a group, determine the level of the market. And they under-
estimate how similar to their own thinking is that of other investors.
Many individual investors think that institutional investors dom-
inate the market and that these “smart money” investors have
sophisticated models to understand prices—superior knowledge.
Little do they know that most institutional investors are, by and
large, equally clueless about the level of the market. In short, the
price level is driven to a certain extent by a self-fulfilling prophecy
based on similar hunches held by a vast cross section of large and
small investors and reinforced by news media that are often con-
tent to ratify this investor-induced conventional wisdom.
When the Dow Jones Industrial Average first surpassed 10,000
in March 1999, Merrill Lynch took out a full-page newspaper ad
with a headline saying, “Even those with a disciplined long-term
approach like ours have to sit back and say ‘wow.’” In the bottom
left corner of the page, next to a stock plot ending up at 10,000,
appeared the words “HUMANACHIEVEMENT.” If this is an achieve-
ment worth congratulating, then we should congratulate em-
ployees whenever they submit glowing self-evaluation reports.

xvi PREFACE
At present there is a whiff of extravagant expectation, if not irra-
tional exuberance, in the air. People are optimistic about the stock
market. There is a lack of sobriety about its downside and the con-
sequences that would ensue as a result. If the Dow were to drop
to 6,000, the loss would represent something like the equivalent
value of the entire housing stock of the United States. There would
be harmful and uneven effects on individuals, pension funds,
college endowments, and charitable organizations.
We need to know if the price level of the stock market today, tomor-
row, or on any other day is a sensible reflection of economic reality,
just as we need to know as individuals what we have in our bank
accounts. This valuation is the future food on our tables and
clotheson our backs, and nearly every decision to spend money today
ought to be influenced by it. We need a better understanding of the
forces that shape the long-run outlook for the market—and it is such
an understanding that this book is intended to provide.
Outline of This Book
After an introductory chapter placing the current stock market into
historical context, Part I discusses precipitating events: factors
outside the stock market, such as technology and demography, that
nevertheless shape the market’s behavior. It also covers amplify-
ing mechanisms that cause these precipitating factors to have such
an outsized effect on the market. These mechanisms can reinforce
confidence in the market despite its already high price by creating
situations in which price changes cause further price changes, thus
beginning the speculative bubble.
Part II introduces cultural factors that further reinforce the struc-
ture of the speculative bubble. These factors include accounts of
the economy that contend that it has moved into a “new era” that
makes it impervious to downside forces, accounts that are ampli-
fied by the news media. Examples of similar “new era” thinking
at each of the previous market peaks in the twentieth century are
recounted, as are numerous examples from other countries.
Part III discusses the evidence we have collected about the psy-
chological anchors and herd behavior that further define the spec-
ulative bubble.

PREFACE xvii
Part IV investigates attempts on the part of academic and pop-
ular thinkers to rationalize the recent market levels through, for
example, the efficient markets theory and the “learning” of certain
“facts” about the behavior of the market.
Part V analyzes the implications of the current speculative
bubblefor individual investors, institutions, and governments. Sev-
eral prescriptions for urgently needed policy changes are offered,
as are suggestions for ways in which individual investors can
lower their exposure to the consequences of a “burst” bubble.

Acknowledgments
Jeremy Siegel, while clearly not
agreeing with me on all points,
urged me to set down my ideas in this book. He is its real instigator.
Jeremy has been a lifelong friend. Our families regularly vacation
together, and I learned a distinctive approach to finance from him
while strolling the beach together or watching our children fish.
John Campbell, my former student, then co-author on a dozen
scholarly papers on financial markets, and for years a close friend,
has been my intellectual other half in formulating many of the ideas
that led to this book. My original work on volatility in financial mar-
kets was refined and significantly advanced with his collaboration.
He has also offered many helpful suggestions for this book and com-
ments on the manuscript.
Peter Dougherty, my editor at Princeton University Press, has
been an extremely important formative influence on the book,
helping to define the fundamental aspects of its structure. He has
been a great colleague and more—really almost a collaborator. Peter
Strupp of Princeton Editorial Associates was an unusually helpful
copy editor.

I was fortunate to have several excellent research assistants to
help me during the writing. Peter Fabrizio unearthed the truth about
many of the historical events discussed. Yuanfeng Hou performed
careful data analysis. Luis Mancilla was a skillful fact finder.
Steven Pawliczek was the source of many important ideas.
I am also blessed with a number of friends and colleagues who
read drafts of the manuscript and provided extensive comments:
Stefano Athanasoulis, John Geanakoplos, William Konigsberg,
Stephen Morris, Sharon Oster, Jay Ritter, Martin Shubik, and
James Tobin.
My colleagues at the Cowles Foundation for Research in Eco-
nomics at Yale University—Donald Brown, Stefan Krieger, and
William Nordhaus—have been a great help. I must also take this
occasion to express gratitude to our late founder,Alfred Cowles
III, an investment manager in the early part of this century and
patron of mathematical economics, who tabulated the pre-1926 div-
idend and earnings data used in this book.
Help from my colleagues at the new Yale International Center
for Finance—its director, William Goetzmann, as well as Zhiwu
Chen, Roger Ibbotson, Ivo Welch, and Jeffrey Wurgler—is also
acknowledged. Roger, who is currently giving talks entitled “Dow
100,000” and predicting a brilliant future for the stock market, has
been a willing foil for my ideas.
Support from my colleagues at Case Shiller Weiss, Inc.—its
president,Allan Weiss, as well as Karl Case, Neel Krishnaswami,
and Terry Loebs—is much appreciated.As a team, they are attempt-
ing to put into practice some of the improvements to our society’s
risk management institutions that I describe at the end of this book.
I am grateful to the Russell Sage Foundation for sponsoring the
behavioral finance workshops that Richard Thaler and I have
been organizing for the past ten years at the National Bureau of
Economic Research. The term behavioral financerefers to research
on financial markets that takes into account the details of human
behavior, including human psychology and sociology. This book
benefits immeasurably from the work of the many scholars in the
emerging field of behavioral finance, which is now beginning to
take a solid place in university finance departments.

One
The Stock Market Level
in Historical Perspective
When Alan Greenspan, chair-
man of the Federal Reserve
Board in Washington, used the term irrational exuberanceto describe
the behavior of stock market investors in an otherwise staid speech
on December 5, 1996, the world fixated on those words. Stock mar-
kets dropped precipitously. In Japan, the Nikkei index dropped
3.2%; in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng dropped 2.9%; and in Germany,
the DAX dropped 4%. In London, the FT-SE 100 index was down
4% at one point during the day, and in the United States, the Dow
Jones Industrial Average was down 2.3% near the beginning of trad-
ing. The words irrational exuberancequickly became Greenspan’s
most famous quote—a catch phrase for everyone who follows the
market.
Why did the world react so strongly to these words? One view
is that they were considered simply as evidence that the Federal
Reserve would soon tighten monetary policy, and the world was
merely reacting to revised forecasts of the Board’s likely actions.
But that cannot explain why the public still remembers irrational
exuberance so well years later. I believe that the reaction to these
words reflects the public’s concern that the markets may indeed

4 THE STOCK MARKET LEVEL IN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
have been bid up to unusually high and unsustainable levels
under the influence of market psychology. Greenspan’s words
suggest the possibility that the stock market will drop—or at least
become a less promising investment.
History certainly gives credence to this concern. In the balance
of this chapter, we study the historical record.Although the dis-
cussion in this chapter gets pretty detailed, I urge you to follow its
thread, for the details place today’s situation in a useful, and quite
revealing, context.
Market Heights
By historical standards, the U.S. stock market has soared to ex-
tremely high levels in recent years. These results have created a sense
among the investing public that such high valuations, and even
higher ones, will be maintained in the foreseeable future.Yet if the
history of high market valuations is any guide, the public may be
very disappointed with the performance of the stock market in com-
ing years.
An unprecedented increase just before the start of the new mil-
lennium has brought the market to this great height. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average (from here on, the Dow for short) stood at
around 3,600 in early 1994. By 1999, it had passed 11,000, more than
tripling in five years, a total increase in stock market prices of over
200%.At the start of 2000, the Dow passed 11,700.
However, over the same period, basic economic indicators did
not come close to tripling. U.S. personal income and gross domes-
tic product rose less than 30%, and almost half of this increase was
due to inflation. Corporate profits rose less than 60%, and that from
a temporary recession-depressed base. Viewed in the light of these
figures, the stock price increase appears unwarranted and, certainly
by historical standards, unlikely to persist.
Large stock price increases have occurred in many other countries
at the same time. In Europe, between 1994 and 1999 the stock
market valuations of France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United
Kingdom roughly doubled. The stock market valuations of Canada,
too, just about doubled, and those of Australia increased by half.

==================================================

THE STOCK MARKET LEVEL IN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE 5
In the course of 1999, stock markets in Asia (Hong Kong, Indone-
sia, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, and South Korea) and Latin Amer-
ica (Brazil, Chile, and Mexico) have made spectacular gains. But no
other country of comparable size has had so large an increase since
1994 as that seen in the United States.
Price increases in single-family homes have also occurred over
the same time, but significant increases have occurred in only a few
cities. Between 1994 and 1999 the total average real price increase
of homes in ten major U.S. cities was only 9%. These price increases
are tiny relative to the increase in the U.S. stock market.1
The extraordinary recent levels of U.S. stock prices, and asso-
ciated expectations that these levels will be sustained or surpassed
in the near future, present some important questions. We need to
know whether the current period of high stock market pricing is
like the other historical periods of high pricing, that is, whether it
will be followed by poor or negative performance in coming years.
We need to know confidently whether the increase that brought
us here is indeed a speculative bubble—an unsustainable increase
in prices brought on by investors’ buying behavior rather than by
genuine, fundamental information about value. In short, we need
to know if the value investors have imputed to the market is not
really there, so that we can readjust our planning and thinking.
A Look at the Data
Figure 1.1 shows, for the United States, the monthly real (cor-
rected for inflation using the Consumer Price Index) Standard and
Poor’s (S&P) Composite Stock Price Index from January 1871
through January 2000 (upper curve), along with the correspond-
ing series of real S&PComposite earnings (lower curve) for the same
years.2This figure allows us to get a truly long-term perspective
on the U.S. stock market’s recent levels. We can see how differently
the market has behaved recently as compared with the past. We
see that the market has been heading up fairly uniformly ever since
it bottomed out in July 1982. It is clearly the most dramatic bull mar-
ket in U.S. history. The spiking of prices in the years 1992 through
2000 has been most remarkable: the price index looks like a rocket

taking off through the top of the chart! This largest stock market
boom ever may be referred to as the millennium boom.3
Yet this dramatic increase in prices since 1982 is not matched in
real earnings growth. Looking at the figure, no such spike in earn-
ings growth occurs in recent years. Earnings in fact seem to be oscil-
lating around a slow, steady growth path that has persisted for over
a century.
No price action quite like this has ever happened before in U.S.
stock market history. There was of course the famous stock run-
up of the 1920s, culminating in the 1929 crash. Figure 1.1 reveals
this boom as a cusp-shaped price pattern for those years. If one

corrects for the market’s smaller scale then, one recognizes that this
episode in the 1920s does resemble somewhat the recent stock mar-
ket increase, but it is the only historical episode that comes even
close to being comparable to the present boom.
There was also a dramatic run-up in the late 1950s and early
1960s, culminating in a flat period for half a decade that was fol-
lowed by the 1973–74 stock market debacle. But the price increase
during this boom was certainly less dramatic than today’s.
Price Relative to Earnings
Part of the explanation for the remarkable price behavior between
1990 and 2000 may have to do with somewhat unusual earnings.
Many observers have remarked that earnings growth in the five-
year period ending in 1997 was extraordinary: real S&P Com-
posite earnings more than doubled over this interval, and such
a rapid five-year growth of real earnings has not occurred for
nearly half a century. But 1992 marked the end of a recession dur-
ing which earnings were temporarily depressed. Similar increases
in earnings growth have happened before following periods of
depressed earnings from recession or depression. In fact, there was
more than a quadrupling of real earnings from 1921 to 1926 as the
economy emerged from the severe recession of 1921 into the pros-
perous Roaring Twenties. Real earnings doubled during five-year
periods following the depression of the 1890s, the Great Depres-
sion of the 1930s, and World War II.
Figure 1.2 shows the price-earnings ratio, that is, the real (inflation-
corrected) S&PComposite Index divided by the ten-year moving
average real earnings on the index. The dates shown are monthly,
January 1881 to January 2000. The price-earnings ratio is a measure
of how expensive the market is relative to an objective measure of
the ability of corporations to earn profits. I use the ten-year aver-
age of real earnings for the denominator, along lines proposed by
Benjamin Graham and David Dodd in 1934. The ten-year average
smooths out such events as the temporary burst of earnings dur-
ing World WarI, the temporary decline in earnings during World
War II, or the frequent boosts and declines that we see due to the
business cycle.4Note again that there is an enormous spike after

1997, when the ratio rises until it hits 44.3 by January 2000. Price-
earnings ratios by this measure have never been so high. The
closest parallel is September 1929, when the ratio hit 32.6.
In the latest data on earnings, earnings are quite high in comparison
with the Graham and Dodd measure of long-run earnings, but noth-
ing here is startlingly out of the ordinary. What is extraordinary today
is the behavior of price (as also seen in Figure 1.1), not earnings.
Other Periods of High Price Relative to Earnings
There have been three other times when the price-earnings ratio as
shown in Figure 1.2 attained high values, though never as high as

the 2000 value. The first time was in June 1901, when the price-
earnings ratio reached a high of 25.2 (see Figure 1.2). This might
be called the “Twentieth Century Peak,” since it came around the
time of the celebration of this century. (The advent of the twentieth
century was celebrated on January 1, 1901, not January 1, 1900.)5
This peak occurred as the aftermath of a doubling of real earnings
within five years, following the U.S. economy’s emergence from
the depression of the 1890s.6The 1901 peak in the price-earnings
ratio occurred after a sudden spike in the price-earnings ratio, which
took place between July 1900 and June 1901, an increase of 43%
within eleven months. Aturn-of-the-century optimism, associ-
ated with expansion talk about a prosperous and high-tech future,
appeared.
After 1901, there was no pronounced immediate downtrend in
real prices, but for the next decade prices bounced around or just
below the 1901 level and then fell. By June 1920, the stock market
had lost 67% of its June 1901 real value. The average real return
in the stock market (including dividends) was 3.4% a year in the
five years following June 1901, barely above the real interest rate.
The average real return (including dividends) was 4.4% a year in
the ten years following June 1901, 3.1% a year in the fifteen years
following June 1901, and –0.2% a year in the twenty years following
June 1901.7These are lower returns than we generally expect from
the stock market, though had one held on into the 1920s, returns
would have improved dramatically.
The second instance of a high price-earnings ratio occurred in
September 1929, the high point of the market in the 1920s and the
second-highest ratio of all time. After the spectacular bull market
of the 1920s, the ratio attained a value of 32.6. As we all know, the
market tumbled from this high, with a real drop in the S&PIndex
of 80.6% by June 1932. The decline in real value was profound and
long-lasting. The real S&PComposite Index did not return to its
September 1929 value until December 1958. The average real return
in the stock market (including dividends) was –13.1% a year for
the five years following September 1929, –1.4% a year for the next
ten years, –0.5% a year for the next fifteen years, and 0.4% a year
for the next twenty years.8

10 THE STOCK MARKET LEVEL IN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
The third instance of a high price-earnings ratio occurred in Jan-
uary 1966, when the price-earnings ratio as shown in Figure 1.2
reached a local maximum of 24.1. We might call this the “Kennedy-
Johnson Peak,” drawing as it did on the prestige and charisma of
President John Kennedy and the help of his vice-president and
successor Lyndon Johnson. This peak came after a dramatic bull
market and after a five-year price surge, from May 1960, of 46%.
This surge, which took the price-earnings ratio to its local maxi-
mum, corresponded to a surge in earnings of 53%. The market
reacted to this earnings growth as if it expected the growth to con-
tinue, but of course it did not. Real earnings increased little in the
next decade. Real prices bounced around near their January 1966
peak, surpassing it somewhat in 1968 but then falling back, and real
stock prices were down 56% from their January 1966 value by
December 1974. Real stock prices would not be back up to the Jan-
uary 1966 level until May 1992. The average real return in the stock
market (including dividends) was –2.6% a year for the five years fol-
lowing January 1966, –1.8% a year for the next ten years, –0.5% a year
for the next fifteen years, and 1.9% a year for the next twenty years.
A Historical Relation between Price-Earnings Ratios
and Subsequent Long-Term Returns
Figure 1.3 is a scatter diagram showing, for January of each year
1881 to 1989, on the horizontal axis, the price-earnings ratio for that
month, and, on the vertical axis, the annualized real (inflation-
corrected) stock market return over the ten years following that
month. This scatter diagram allows us to see visually how well the
price-earnings ratio forecasts subsequent long-term (ten-year)
returns. Only January data are shown: if all twelve months of
each year were shown there would be so many points that the scat-
ter would be unreadable. The downside of this plotting method,
of course, is that by showing only January data we miss most of
the peaks and troughs of the market. For example, we miss the peak
of the market in 1929 and also miss the negative returns that fol-
lowed it. The price-earnings ratio shown in Figure 1.3 is the same
as that plotted in Figure 1.2. Each year is indicated by the last two

our testimony before the board of governors of the Federal Reserve
on December 3, 1996.9

12 THE STOCK MARKET LEVEL IN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
The swarm of points in the scatter shows a definite tilt, sloping
down from the upper left to the lower right. The scatter shows that
in some years near the left of the scatter (such as January 1920, Jan-
uary 1949, or January 1982) subsequent long-term returns have been
very high. In some years near the right of the scatter (such as Jan-
uary 1929, January 1937, or January 1966) subsequent returns
have been very low. There are also some important exceptions, such
as January 1899, which still managed to have subsequent ten-
year returns as high as 5.5% a year despite a high price-earnings
ratio of 22.9, and January 1922, which managed to have subsequent
ten-year returns of only 8.7% a year despite a low price-earnings
ratio of 7.4. But the point of this scatter diagram is that, as a rule
and on average, years with low price-earnings ratios have been fol-
lowed by high returns, and years with high price-earnings ratios
have been followed by low or negative returns.
The relation between price-earnings ratios and subsequent
returns appears to be moderately strong, though there are ques-
tions about its statistical significance, since there are only about
twelve nonoverlapping ten-year intervals in the 119 years’ worth
of data. There has been substantial academic debate about the sta-
tistical significance of relationships like this one, and some diffi-
cult questions of statistical methodology are still being addressed.
We believe, however, that the relation should be regarded as
statistically significant.10 Our confidence in the relation derives
partly from the fact that analogous relations appear to hold for other
countries and for individual stocks. Figure 1.3 confirms that long-
term investors—investors who can commit their money to an
investment for ten full years—do well when prices were low rel-
ative to earnings at the beginning of the ten years and do poorly
when prices were high at the beginning of the ten years. Long-term
investors would be well advised, individually, to stay mostly out
of the market when it is high, as it is today, and get into the mar-
ket when it is low.11
The recent values of the price-earnings ratio, well over 40, are far
outside the historical range of price-earnings ratios. If one were to
locate such a price-earnings ratio on the horizontal axis, it would

THE STOCK MARKET LEVEL IN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE 13
be off the chart altogether. It is a matter of judgment to say, from
the data shown in Figure 1.3, what predicted return the relation-
ship suggests over the succeeding ten years; the answer depends
on whether one fits a straight line or a curve to the scatter, and since
the 2000 price-earnings ratio is outside the historical range, the shape
of the curve can matter a lot. Suffice it to say that the diagram sug-
gests substantially negative returns, on average, for the next ten
years.
Part of the reason to suspect that the relation shown in Figure1.3
is real is that, historically, when price was high relative to earnings
as computed here (using a ten-year moving average of earnings),
the return in terms of dividends has been low, and when price
was low relative to earnings, the return in terms of dividends has
been high.12Therecent record-high price-earnings ratios have been
matched by record-low dividend yields. In January 2000, S&P
dividends were 1.2% of price, far below the 4.7% that is the his-
torical average. It is natural to suppose that when one is getting
so much lower dividends from the shares one owns, one ought to
expect to earn lower investing returns overall. The dividend is, after
all, part of the total return one gets from holding stocks (the other
part being the capital gain), and dividends historically represent
the dominant part of the average return on stocks. The reliable
return attributable to dividends, not the less predictable portion
arising from capital gains, is the main reason why stocks have on
average been such good investments historically.
Returns from holding stocks must therefore be low when div-
idends are low—unless low dividends themselves are somehow
predictors of stock market price increases, so that one can at times
of low dividends actually expect stock price to rise more than usual
to offset the effects of the low dividends on returns.As a matter
of historical fact, times when dividends have been low relative to
stock prices have nottended to be followed by higher stock price
increases in the subsequent five or ten years. Quite to the contrary:
times of low dividends relative to stock price in the stock market
as a whole tend to be followed by price decreases(or smaller than
usual increases) over long horizons, and so returns tend to take a

==================================================

doublehit at such times, from both low dividend yields and price
decreases. Thus the simple wisdom—that when one is not getting
much in dividends relative to the price one pays for stocks it is not
a good time to buy stocks—turns out to have been right historically.
Worries about Irrational Exuberance
The news media have tired of describing the high levels of the
market, and discussion of it is usually omitted from considerations
of market outlook. And yet, deep down, people know that the mar-
ket is highly priced, and they are uncomfortable about this fact.
Most people I meet, from all walks of life, are puzzled over the
apparently high levels of the stock market. We are unsure whether
the market levels make any sense, or whether they are indeed the
result of some human tendency that might be called irrational exu-
berance. We are unsure whether the high levels of the stock market
might reflect unjustified optimism, an optimism thatmight pervade
our thinking and affect many of our life decisions. We are unsure
what to make of any sudden market correction, wondering if the
previous market psychology will return.
EvenAlan Greenspan seems unsure. He made his “irrational exu-
berance” speech two days after I had testified before him and the
Federal Reserve Board that market levels were irrational, but a mere
seven months later he reportedly took an optimistic “new era” posi-
tion on the economy and the stock market. In fact, Greenspan
has always been very cautious in his public statements, and he has
not committed himself to either view. A modern version of the
prophets who spoke in riddles, Greenspan likes to pose questions
rather than make pronouncements. In the public exegesis of his
remarks, it is often forgotten that, when it comes to such questions,
even he does not know the answers.

Two
Precipitating Factors: The Internet,
the Baby Boom, and Other Events
If the growth of the economy
does not in itself justify the
increase in the value of the stock market since 1982, then what has
changed since 1982 to cause the market to climb? What precipitating
factors started this remarkable surge? What, in particular, has
happened since July 1997, when the price-earnings ratio passed
above its former record high, set in September 1929, and then
proceeded to move up by yet another third by the start of 2000?
To answer these questions, it is not enough to say that the markets
in general are vulnerable to irrational exuberance. We must specify
what has changed to cause the market to behave so differently from
other times.
Most historical events, from wars through revolutions, do not
have simple causes. When these events move in extreme directions,
as price-earnings ratios have in the recent stock market, it is usu-
ally because of a confluence of factors, none of which is by itself
large enough to explain these events.
Rome wasn’t built in a day, nor was it destroyed by one sudden
bolt of bad fortune. More likely, it owed its fall to a plurality of
factors—some large and some small, some remote and some

immediate—that conspired together. This ambiguity is unsatisfying
to those of us seeking scientific certitude, especially given that it
is so hard to identify and isolate the precipitating factors to begin
with. But that is the nature of history, and such ambiguity justifies
the constant search for new and better information to expose at least
the overall contours of causation.
Recognizing these limitations, let us look at a list of factors—
twelve of them—that may help explain the present speculative mar-
ket. These factors make up the skin of the bubble, if you will. I
concentrate here mostly on factors that have had an effect on the market
that is not warranted by rational analysis of economic fundamentals.The
list omits consideration of all the small variations in fundamental
factors (e.g., the growth in earnings, the change in real interest rates)
thatshouldrationally have an impact on financial markets. In more
normal times or in markets for individual stocks, such rational fac-
tors would assume relatively greater prominence in any discussion
of changes in prices. Indeed it is thanks to a market’s ability to
respond appropriately to such factors, for a variety of invest-
ments, that well-functioning financial markets generally promote,
rather than hinder, economic efficiency.1The list of factors here was
constructed specifically to help us understand the extraordinary
recent situation in the stock market, and so it concentrates on less
rational influences.
In detailing these twelve factors, I describe the reaction of the
general public, not just of professional investment managers.
Some observers believe that professional investment managers are
more sensible and work to offset the irrational exuberanceof the non-
professional investing public. Therefore these observers might
argue that a sharp distinction should be drawn between the behav-
ior of the professionals and the nonprofessionals.2 Professional
investors, however, are not immune from the effects of the popu-
lar investing culture that we observe in individual investors, and
many of the factors described here no doubt influence their think-
ing as well. There is in fact no clear distinction between professional
institutional investors and individual investors, since the profes-
sionals routinely give advice to the individual investors.

==================================================

PRECIPITATING FACTORS 19
Some of these factors exist in the background of the market,
including the revolution in information technology, a linking of
patriotic feeling with supposed “victory” over foreign economic
rivals, increased emphasis on business success, the political shift
in support of business, the demographics of the Baby Boom, the
decline of inflation and the economics of money illusion, and the
rise of gambling and pleasure in risk taking in general. Others oper-
ate in the foreground and shape the changing culture of invest-
ment. These include greatly increased media coverage of business,
the aggressively optimistic forecasts of stock analysts, the rise of
401(k) plans, the mutual funds explosion, and the expanding vol-
ume of trade.
Despite their varied origins, these twelve factors have something
in common: they have contributed to the self-fulfilling psychology
of a roaring stock market. It is this self-fulfilling psychology that—
at least for now—binds the bubble.
The Arrival of the Internet at a
Time of Solid Earnings Growth
The Internet and the World Wide Web have invaded our homes
during the second half of the 1990s, making us intimately conscious
of the pace of technological change. The World Wide Web first
appeared in the news in November 1993. The Mosaic Web browser
first became available to the public in February 1994. These dates
mark the very beginning of the World Wide Web, when only a
few people had access to it. Large numbers of users did not dis-
coverthe Web until 1997 and later, marking the very years when
the NASDAQ stock price index (which is heavily weighted toward
high-tech stocks) soared, tripling to the beginning of 2000, and price-
earnings ratios took off into unprecedented territory.
Internet technology is unusual in that it is a source of enter-
tainment and preoccupation for us all, indeed for the whole fam-
ily. In this sense, it is comparable in importance to the personal
computer or, before that, to television. In fact, the impression it
conveys of a changed future is even more vivid than that produced

20 STRUCTURAL FACTORS
when televisions or personal computers entered the home. Using
the Internet gives people a sense of mastery of the world. They can
electronically roam the world and accomplish tasks that would have
been impossible before. They can even put up a Web site and
become a factor in the world economy themselves in previously
unimaginable ways. In contrast, the advent of television made them
passive receivers of entertainment, and personal computers were
used by most people before the Internet mainly as typewriters and
high-tech pinball machines.
Because of the vivid and immediate personal impression the
Internet makes, people find it plausible to assume that it also has
great economic importance. It is much easier to imagine the con-
sequences of advances in this technology than the consequences
of, say, improved shipbuilding technology or new developments
in materials science. Most of us simply do not hear much about
research in those areas.
Spectacular U.S. corporate earnings growth in 1994, up 36% in
real terms as measured by the S&PComposite real earnings, fol-
lowed by real earnings growth of 8% in 1995 and 10% in 1996, coin-
cided roughly with the Internet’s birth but in fact had little to do
with the Internet. Instead the earnings growth was attributed by
analysts to a continuation of the slow recovery from the 1990–91
recession, coupled with a weak dollar and strong foreign demand
for U.S. capital and technology exports, as well as cost-cutting ini-
tiatives by U.S. companies. It could not have been the Internet that
caused the growth in profits: the fledgling Internet companies
were not making much of a profit yet, and indeed they still are not.
But the occurrence of profit growth coincident with the appearance
of a new technology as dramatic as the Internet can easily create
an impression among the general public that the two events are
somehow connected. Publicity linking these twin factors was
especially strong with the advent of the new millennium—a time
of much optimistic discussion of the future.
The Internet is, of course, an important technological advance
in its own right, and it, as well as other developments in computer
technology and robotics, does promise to have an unpredictable
and powerful impact on our future. But we may question what

==================================================

PRECIPITATING FACTORS 21
impact the Internet and the computer revolution should have on
the valuation of existing corporations. New technology will always
have an impact on the market, but should it really raise the value
of existing companies, given that those existing companies do
not have a monopoly on the new technology?3Should the advent
of the Internet raise the valuation of the Dow Jones Industrial
Average—which until very recently contained no Internet stocks?4
The notion that existing companies will benefit from the Inter-
net revolution is belied by the stories of E*Trade.com,Amazon.com,
and other upstarts, who did not even exist just a few years ago. Still
more new companies will appear in the future, in the United
States and abroad, and these will compete with the companies in
which we invest today. Simply put, the effect of new technology
on existing companies could go either way: it could boost or
depress their profits.
What matters for a stock market boom is not, however, the
reality of the Internet revolution, which is hard to discern, but rather
thepublicimpressionsthat the revolution creates. Public reaction is
influenced by the intuitive plausibility of Internet lore, and this plau-
sibility is ultimately influenced by the ease with which examples
or arguments come to mind. If we are regularly spending time on
the Internet, then these examples will come to mind very easily.
Triumphalism and the Decline of Foreign Economic Rivals
Since the end of the cold war most other countries have seemed to
be imitating the Western economic system. Communist China has
been embracing market forces since the late 1970s. Increasing tol-
erance of free markets within the Soviet Union culminated with the
breakup of that nation in 1991 into smaller, market-oriented states.
The world seems to be swinging our way, and therefore it starts to
seem only natural that confidence in the premier capitalist system
would translate into confidence in the market, and that the U.S. stock
market should be the most highly valued in the world.
These political events have unfolded gradually since the bull mar-
ket began in 1982. The intervening years have also seen the decline
in the Japanese market after 1989, the prolonged economic slump

in Japan, and the Asian financial crisis of 1997–98, which coincided
roughly with the dramatic burst of the U.S. stock market into
uncharted territory at the end of the millennium. These foreign
events might have been viewed as ominous developments for
the U.S. stock market, as the harbinger of what bad things could
happen here, but instead they were seen by many as the weakening
of major rivals. The relation between the United States and its eco-
nomic rivals is often described in the media as a competition in
which there can only be one winner, as in a sports event. The
weakening of a rival is thus viewed simplistically, as good news.
The triumphalism is associated with patriotic feeling. Of course,
patriotic self-congratulation has long been in evidence in dis-
cussions of the stock market. In the 1990s Merrill Lynch used the
slogan “We’re Bullish on America.” In the 1950s, the New York
StockExchange used the slogan “Take Stock in America.” Popu-
lar slogans during the bull market of the 1920s were “Be a Bull
onAmerica” and “Never Sell the United States Short.” But while
such patriotic associations have long been with us, the associations
assume more prominence after a perceived economic victory.
Extensive public discussion of perennial economic problems,
which we may hear after the country feels humbled by failures,
seems out of bounds after a triumph.
Cultural Changes Favoring Business
Success or the Appearance Thereof
The bull market has been accompanied by a significant rise in mate-
rialistic values. ARoper-Starch questionnaire survey in both 1975
and 1994 asked, “When you think of the good life—the life you’d
like to have, which of the things on this list, if any, are part of that
good life, as far as you personally are concerned?” In 1975, 38%
picked “a lot of money,” whereas in 1994 fully 63% did.5
Materialistic values do not by themselves have any logical bear-
ing on the level of the stock market. Whether or not people are mate-
rialistic, it is still reasonable to expect them to save for the future
and to seek out the best vehicles for their savings. But it is plau-
sible that such feelings would influence their demand for stocks,

which have long held out at least the possibility of amassing sub-
stantial and quick riches. Such feelings have transformed our cul-
ture into one that reveres the successful businessperson as much
as or even more than the accomplished scientist, artist, or revolu-
tionary. The idea that investing in stocks is a road to quick riches
has a certain appeal to born-again materialists.
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, downsizing (the movement to
release surplus staff and the consequent decline in job security) led
to a change in the way people viewed their lives. The experience
of being laid off, or at least of knowing others who had been, was
often viewed as a violation of an implicit pact of loyalty between
employee and employer. Such an experience encouraged workers
to take control of their own lives and to rely less on employers, to
become in effect economic entities unto themselves, rather than
parts of a larger economic organization.
Labor unions have long been in decline: the fraction of wage and
salary workers who were union members fell to 13.9% in 1998,
down from 20.1% in 1983.6 The reasons for the decline are con-
troversial, but a key factor appears to be an erosion of solidarity
and loyalty among workers, an attitude that has come to be re-
placed by an individual business-success ethic. By pursuing
speculative investments, people in effect create for themselves a
second job—one where they are, at last, their own boss. And in
many cases it is a job that seems to provide a source of income—
income derived from one’s direct interaction with the world at large,
not as part of an organization.
Firms have tilted their compensation packages for manage-
ment away from fixed salaries toward participation, as investors,
in the firm. By 1998, employee stock options had reached 6.2% of
the outstanding shares in a sample of 144 of the largest S&P500
firms.7 With such options—which hold out the promise of sub-
stantial wealth if the stock price rises above the exercise price of
the options—management has an incentive to do everything they
can to boost share prices. They have an incentive to maintain an
appearance of corporate success, an image of the company as work-
ing toward a brilliant future. They have an incentive to undertake
corporate initiatives whenever they think the market will respond

to them, even if they themselves are doubtful of the value of these
initiatives. For example, managers the world over have of late been
scratching their heads to figure out how they can redefine their firms
as Internet companies because of the high market valuation such com-
panies currently enjoy. This headlong rush to achieve dot-com sta-
tus may lead them to undertake new and costly Internet-related
investments with little concern for their long-run consequences.
Managers holding incentive options also have an unusual incen-
tive to substitute share repurchases for a portion of the dividend
payout, since the direct effect of such a substitution is to increase
the value of the managers’ options. Between 1994 and 1998, the 144
firms mentioned earlier repurchased on average 1.9% of their out-
standing shares each year, more than offsetting the 0.9% of shares
issued per year, largely to meet the exercise of employee options.8
This level of substituting share repurchasing for dividends alone
should have boosted share prices by a few percentage points.9
A Republican Congress and Capital Gains Tax Cuts
When Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980, so too was a Republi-
can Senate, the first since 1948. In 1994, the House went to the
Republicans as well. Sensing the changed public attitudes that had
elected them, these lawmakers were much more pro-business
than their Democratic predecessors. This change in Congress has
boosted public confidence in the stock market, because of a variety
of controls that the legislature can exert over corporate profits
and investor returns.
Consider taxation. No sooner had the Republican Congress been
seated in 1995 than proposals to cut the capital gains tax became
prominent. In 1997, the top capital gains tax rate was cut from 28%
to 20%. After this cut had been enacted, Congress talked of cutting
rates further.A1999 tax bill would have cut capital gains taxes still
further, had President Clinton not vetoed it.
Anticipation of possible future capital gains tax cuts can have
a favorable impact on the stock market, even when tax rates actu-
ally remain unchanged. From 1994 to 1997, investors were widely
advised to hold on to their long-term capital gains, not to realize

them, until after the capital gains tax cut. This had a strengthen-
ing effect on the market. At the time of the 1997 capital gains tax
cut, there was fear that investors who had been waiting to sell would
do so and bring the market down, as had apparently happened after
capital gains tax cuts in 1978 and 1980. But this did not happen in
1997. Of course, many investors must have thought there could be
an even more favorable capital gains tax rate in their future, and
if so there would have been no reason to sell right after the 1997
cut took effect.
It is likely that the general atmosphere of public talk of future
capital gains tax cuts, of possible indexing of capital gains taxes
to inflation, and of analogous tax cuts such as estate tax cuts has
created among investors a reluctance to sell their appreciated
stocks. If capital gains tax rates may be cut sharply in the future,
why sell when the rates are as high as 20%? Having been advised
by experts to wait and see about capital gains tax cuts, many
investors could be expected to defer sales of appreciated assets until
we are more clearly at a historic low in capital gains tax rates. Such
an atmosphere of holding, not folding, naturally places upward
pressure on stock prices.
The Baby Boom and Its Perceived Effects on the Market
Following World War II, there was a substantial increase in the birth
rate in the United States. Peacetime prosperity encouraged those
who had postponed families because of the depression and the war
to have children. There were also postwar birth rate increases in
the United Kingdom, France, and Japan, but they were not as
protracted or strong as that in the United States, no doubt at least
in part because the economies of those nations were in such dis-
array after the war. Then, around 1966, the growth of U.S. and world
population showed a dramatic decline, one that continues to this
day. This decline was unusual, if not unique, by historical standards:
it did not occur because of famine or war, but rather because of an
endogenous decline in the fertility rate.10
Advances in birth control technology (the pill was invented in
1959 and became widely available by the mid-1960s in the United

States and many other countries) and social changes that accepted
the legality of contraception and abortion were instrumental in low-
ering the rate of population growth, as were growing urbanization
and advances in education and economic aspiration levels. Now
the Baby Boom and the subsequent Baby Bust have created a
looming social security crisis in many countries of the world:
when the Boomers grow old and finally retire, the number of young
working people available to support the elderly population will
decline worldwide.11
The Baby Boom in the United States was marked by very high
birth rates during the years 1946–66, and so there are in the year
2000 (and will be for some time) an unusually large number of
people between the ages of 35 and 55. Two theories suggest that
the presence of so many middle-aged people ought to boost to-
day’s stock market. One theory justifies the high price-earnings
ratios we see today as the result of those Boomers’ competing
against each other to buy stocks to save for their eventual retire-
ment and bidding share prices up relative to the earnings they gen-
erate. According to the other theory, it is spending on current
goods and services that boosts stocks, through a generalized pos-
itive effect on the economy: high expenditures mean high profits
for companies.
These simple Baby Boom stories are just a bit too simple. For one
thing, they neglect to consider whenthe Baby Boom should affect
the stock market. Maybe the effect of the Baby Boom has already
been factored into stock prices by investors. They also neglect such
factors as the emergence of new capitalist economies worldwide
and their demand, in another twenty years, for U.S. stocks. The
theory that the Baby Boom drives the market up owing to Boomers’
demand for goods would seem to imply that the market is high
because earnings are high; it would not explain today’s high price-
earnings ratios.
If life-cycle savings patterns (the first effect) alone were to be the
dominant force in the markets for savings vehicles, there would
tend to be strong correlations in price behavior across alternative
asset classes, and strong correlations over time between asset prices
and demographics. When the most numerous generation feels

they need to save, they would tend to bid up allsavings vehicles:
stocks, bonds, and real estate. When the most numerous genera-
tion feels they need to draw down their savings, their selling would
tend to force down the prices of allthese vehicles. But when one
looks at long-term data on stocks, bonds, and real estate, one finds
that there has in fact been very little relation between their real val-
ues.12Possibly these differences across asset classes could still be
reconciled with a Baby Boom theory, by postulating that people
in different age groups have different attitudes toward risk because
of age-related differences in risk tolerance, that the stock market is
relatively high now because the numerous people in their forties
today are naturally less risk averse than older people. But such a
theory has never been carefully worked out or shown to explain
relative price movements. It is also noteworthy that the personal
savings rate in the United States has recently been nearly zero, not
significantly positive, as the life-cycle theory might suggest. Of
course, one might argue that were it not for the Baby Boom, the
effect of the high stock market would have been to make savings,
as measured, strongly negative, since the capital gains on stocks
would be considered income not included in the national income,
income that people could normally be expected to spend from.13
Another theory as to why Boomers may be less risk averse is that
the Boomers, who have no memory of the Great Depression of the
1930s or of World War II, have less anxiety about the market and
the world. There is indeed some evidence that shared experiences
in formative years leave a mark forever on a generation’s attitudes.14
Over the course of the bull market since 1982, Boomers have grad-
ually replaced as prime investors those who were teens or young
adults during the depression and the war.
Although there is no doubt at least some truth to these theories
of the Baby Boom’s effects on the stock market, it may be public
perceptionsof the Baby Boom and its presumed effects that are most
responsible for the surge in the market. The impact of the Baby
Boom is one of the most talked-about issues relating to the stock
market, and all this talk in and of itself has the potential to affect
stock market value. People believe that the Baby Boom represents
an important source of strength for the market today, and they do

not see this strength faltering any time soon. These public per-
ceptions contribute to a feeling that there is a good reason for the
market to be high and a confidence that it will stay that way for
some time to come. Congratulating themselves on their cleverness
in understanding and betting on these population trends in their
stock market investments, many investors fail to appreciate just how
common their thinking really is. Their perceptions fuel the con-
tinuing upward spiral in market valuations.
The most prominent exponent of the Baby Boom theory of the
stock market has been Harry S. Dent. He began with a 1992 book
entitledThe Great Boom Ahead: Your Comprehensive Guide to Personal
and Business Profit in the New Era of Prosperity,which was so suc-
cessful that he has written several sequels. His 1998 book, The Roar-
ing 2000s: Building the Wealth & Lifestyle You Desire in the Greatest
Boom in History,was on the New York Timesbest-seller list for four
weeks in 1998. His 1999 book, The Roaring 2000s Investor: Strategies
for the Life You Want,is as of this writing ranked within the top 100
in sales among all books according to Amazon.com. This book pre-
dicts that the stock market will continue to boom until 2009, when
the number of people who are 46 starts to decline, and then the mar-
ket will drop.
Dent’s success with the Baby Boom theme has predictably
spawned a number of imitators—all extolling the wonderful
opportunities now to get rich in the stock market—with titles like
Boomernomics: The Future of Your Money in the Upcoming Generational
Warfareby William Sterling and Stephen Waite (1998) and Boom, Bust
& Echo: How to Profit from the Coming Demographic Shiftby David
K. Foot and Daniel Stoffman (1996). Discussions of the Baby Boom
and its effects on the stock market are everywhere, and their gen-
eral tone is that the Boom is good for the stock market now and
will be for years to come.
An Expansion in Media Reporting of Business News
The first all-news television station, the Cable News Network
(CNN), appeared in 1980 and gradually grew, with viewership



==================================================
                     PAGE 52

boosted by such events as the Gulf War in 1991 and the O. J.
Simpson trial in 1995, both stories that fueled great demand for un-
interrupted coverage. The public acquired the habit of watching
the news on television throughout the day (and night), not simply
at the dinner hour. CNN was followed by the business networks.
The Financial News Network, founded in 1983, was later absorbed
into CNBC. Then came CNNfn and Bloomberg Television. Together,
these networks produced an uninterrupted stream of financial
news,much of it devoted to the stock market. So pervasive was their
influence that traditional brokerage firms found it necessary to keep
CNBC running in the lower corners of their brokers’ computer
screens. So many clients would call to ask about something they
had just heard on the networks that brokers (who were supposed
to be too busy working to watch television!) began to seem behind
the curve.
Not merely the scope but also the nature of business reporting
has changed in recent years. According to a study by Richard
Parker,a senior fellow at Harvard University’s Shorenstein Cen-
ter, newspapers in the past twenty years have transformed their
formerly staid business sections into enhanced “Money” sections,
which dispense useful tips about personal investing. Articles
about individual corporations that used to be written as if they
would be of interest only to those involved in the industry or the
corporations themselves now are written with a slant toward profit
opportunities for individual investors. Articles about corporations
regularly include analysts’ opinions of the implications of the
news for investors.15
Such enhanced business reporting leads to increased demand
for stocks, just as advertisements for a consumer product make
people more familiar with the product, remind them of the option
to buy, and ultimately motivate them to buy. Most advertising is
really not the presentation of important facts about the product but
merely a reminder of the product and its image. Given the height-
ened media coverage of investments, a stock market boom should
come as no greater surprise than increased sales of the latest sports
utility vehicle after a major ad campaign.

30 STRUCTURAL FACTORS
Analysts’ Increasingly Optimistic Forecasts
According to data from Zacks Investment Research about analysts’
recommendations on some 6,000 companies, only 1.0% of recom-
mendations were “sells” in late 1999 (while 69.5% were “buys” and
29.9% were “holds”). This situation stands in striking contrast to
that indicated by previous data. Ten years earlier, the fraction of
sells, at 9.1%, was nine times higher.16
Analysts are now reluctant to recommend that investors sell
anything. One reason often given for this reluctance is that a sell
recommendation might incur the wrath of the company involved.
Companies can retaliate by refusing to talk with analysts whom
they view as submitting negative reports, excluding them from
information sessions, and not offering them access to key execu-
tives as they prepare earnings forecasts. This situation represents
a change in the fundamental culture of the investment industry,
and in the tacit understanding that recommendations are as objec-
tive as the analyst can make them.
Another reason that many analysts are reluctant to issue sell rec-
ommendations is that an increasing number of them are employed
by firms that underwrite securities, and these firms do not want
their analysts to do anything that might jeopardize this lucrative
side of the business. Analysts affiliated with investment banks give
significantly more favorable recommendations on firms for which
their employer is the co- or lead underwriter than do unaffiliated
analysts, even though their earnings forecasts are not usually
stronger.17
Those who know the ropes realize that today’s hold recommen-
dation is more like the sell recommendation of yesteryear.Accord-
ing to James Grant, a well-known market commentator, “Honesty
was never a profit center on Wall Street, but the brokers used to
keep up appearances. Now they have stopped pretending. More
than ever, securities research, as it is called, is a branch of sales.
Investor, beware.”18
Analysts’ recommendations have been transformed by something
analogous to grade inflation in our schools: C used to be an aver-
age grade, yet now it is considered as bordering on failure. Many

of us know that such inflation happens, and we try to correct for
it in interpreting our children’s grades. Similarly, in the market we
factor inflation into analysts’ recommendations. But not everyone
is going to make adequate corrections for analysts’ newly hyper-
bolic language, and so the general effect of their changed standards
will be to encourage the higher valuation of stocks.
Moreover, it is not just a change in the units of measurement that
infects analysts’ reports. Even their quantitative forecasts of earn-
ings growth show an upward bias. According to a study by
Steven Sharpe of the Federal Reserve Board, analysts’ expectations
of growth in the S&P500 earnings per share exceeded actual growth
in sixteen of the eighteen years between 1979 and 1996. The aver-
age difference between the projected and actual growth rate of
earnings was 9 percentage points. The analysts breezed through
both the steep recession of 1980–81 and the recession of 1990–91
making forecasts of earnings growth in the 10% range.19
This bias in analysts’ forecasts is a characteristic of their one-year
forecasts; they are usually more sober in predicting the next earn-
ings announcement just before it is released. Analysts tend to
comply with firms’ wishes to see positive earnings surprises each
quarter, by issuing estimates that fall slightly short of the actual
number. Firms may, just before making earnings announcements,
talk with analysts whose forecasts are on the high side, urging them
down, while neglecting to talk with analysts whose forecasts are
on the low side, thereby creating a downward bias in the average
earnings forecast without being blatantly untruthful.20 Casual
evaluation of analysts’ forecasts by clients would most naturally
take the form of comparing the latest earnings announcement with
the latest forecast, and therefore analysts do not sharply over-
estimate earnings just before they are announced, which would be
an obvious embarrassment to them.
Analysts’ upward bias comes to the fore in predicting the vague,
undifferentiated future, not immediate quarterly or yearly outcomes.
And it is expectations for the vague, undifferentiated future, even
far beyond one-year forecasts, that lie behind the high market
valuations we see. Analysts have few worries about being uniformly
optimistic regarding the distant future; they have concluded that

such generalized optimism is simply good for business. Certainly
they perceive that their fellow analysts are demonstrating such long-
run optimism, and there is, after all, safety in numbers. Glibly and
routinely offering “great-outlook-for-the-U.S.” patter to the invest-
ing public, they perhaps give little thought to its accuracy.
The Expansion of Defined Contribution Pension Plans
Changes over time in the nature of employee pension plans have
encouraged people to learn about, and eventually accept, stocks
as investments. Although these changes do not technically favor
stocks over other investments for retirement, they have—by forc-
ing people to make explicit choices among their retirement invest-
ments, choices that previously were made for them—worked in
the direction of encouraging investment in stocks. Making such
choices teaches people about stocks and increases their level of
familiarity with them.
The most revolutionary change in these institutions in the
United States has been the expansion of defined contribution pen-
sion plans at the expense of defined benefit plans. An important
milestone came in 1981, when the first 401(k) plan was created; it
was soon ratified by a landmark ruling by the Internal Revenue
Service.21Prior to that date, employer pension plans had usually
been of the defined benefit type, in which the employer merely
promised a fixed pension to its employees when they retired.
Reserves to pay the defined benefit were managed by the employer.
With 401(k) plans (as well as such analogues as 403(b) plans),
employees are offered the opportunity to have contributions to a
tax-deferred retirement account deducted from their paychecks.
They then own the investments in their 401(k) accounts and must
allocate them among stocks, bonds, and money market accounts.
The tax law encourages employers to make matching contributions
to their employees’ 401(k) accounts, so there is a powerful incen-
tive for employees to participate.
Various factors have also encouraged the growth of defined con-
tribution pension plans since the bottom of the market in 1982. Labor
unions have traditionally sought defined benefit plans for their

PRECIPITATING FACTORS 33
members as a way of ensuring their welfare in retirement, and the
decline of unions has meant diminishing support for these plans.
The importance of the manufacturing sector, long a stronghold of
labor unions and defined benefit pensions, has shrunk. Defined
benefit plans have also become less popular with management,
because so-called overfunded plans sometimes make companies
vulnerable to takeovers. Defined contribution plans are seen as less
costly to administer than defined benefit plans. Moreover, defined
contribution plans have become more popular with those employ-
ees who like to monitor their investments, and therefore compa-
nies have tended to offer the plans to all employees.
Through these tax incentives for participation in plans offering
choices between stocks and bonds, the government has forced work-
ing people to learn about the advantages of stocks versus bonds
or money market investments. Any incentive to learn about an
investment vehicle is likely to boost demand for it. In 1954, when
the New York Stock Exchange carried out a marketing study to
understand how to promote public interest in the stock market, it
concluded that most people did not know very much about stocks:
only 23% of the public even knew enough to define what a share
is. Moreover, the survey revealed a vague public distrust of the stock
market.22 So the exchange held a series of public information
seminars to try to remedy this lack of knowledge and this preju-
dice against stocks as an investment. But no set of seminars that
the exchange could ever afford could compare with the learning-
by-doing effects of the defined contribution plan in encouraging
public knowledge about and interest in stocks.
If one’s attention to the stock market is filtered through the lens
of a pension plan, it may encourage longer-term thinking. The stated
purpose of a 401(k) plan is to prepare for retirement, which is, for
most workers, many years away.A401(k) plan sponsor does not
call participants with tips about short-run investment opportuni-
ties, and statements about portfolio value are mailed out only
infrequently. The participant cannot check his or her portfolio value
every day in the newspaper. This longer-term thinking may boost
stock market valuations by diverting investors from preoccupa-
tion with short-term fluctuations.

==================================================

34 STRUCTURAL FACTORS
Encouraging longer-term thinking among investors is probably,
all in all, a good thing. But an additional effect of 401(k) plans as
they are structured today may be to boost demand for stocks fur-
ther through another psychological mechanism. By offering mul-
tiple stock market investment categoriesfor employees to choose
among, employers can create demand for stocks. An effect of
categories on ultimate investment choices was demonstrated by
economists Shlomo Benartzi and Richard Thaler. They found,
using both experimental data and data on actual pension fund allo-
cations, that people tend to spread their allocations evenly over the
available options, without regard to the contentsof the options. For
example, if a 401(k) plan offers a choice of a stock fund and a bond
fund, many people will put 50% of their contributions into each.
If the plan instead offers a choice between a stock fund and a bal-
anced fund (with, say, 50% stocks and 50% bonds in it) then
people will still tend to put 50% into each, even though they are
now really putting 75% of their portfolio into stocks.23
The options offered as part of 401(k) plans tend to be heavily
weighted in favor of stocks. In contrast, most 401(k) plans do not
have any real estate options; only one plan, that offered by TIAA-
CREF, has an option for genuine, direct investment in real estate.
In this way the growth of 401(k) plans has encouraged the growth
of public interest in the stock market relative to the real estate
market. Indeed the typical 401(k) plan today offers choices among
a stock fund, a balanced fund (typically 60% stocks and 40% bonds),
company stock (investments in the employer itself), possibly a
specialized stock fund such as a growth fund, a bond fund, and a
money market fund, as well as fixed-income guaranteed investment
contracts. It is not surprising, from the findings of the Benartzi and
Thaler study, that people put proportionately more into the stock
funds, given that so many stock-related choices are laid out before
them. Moreover, since there are more interesting “flavors” of
stocks—just as, in the corner liquor store, there are more varieties
of wine than of vodka—more attention is likely to be drawn to them.
It is in such subtle ways that the interest valueorcuriosity value
of stocks, not any kind of rational decision-making process, encour-
ages investors to want to buy more of them than they otherwise

would.And this seemingly unconscious interest has helped bid up
the price of the stock market.
The Growth of Mutual Funds
The stock market boom has coincided with a peculiar growth spurt
in the mutual fund industry and a proliferation of advertising for
mutual funds. In 1982, at the beginning of the recent long-term bull
market, there were only 340 equity mutual funds in the United
States. By 1998, there were 3,513—more equity mutual funds than
stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1982, there were
6.2 million equity mutual fund shareholder accounts in the United
States, about one for every ten U.S. families. By 1998, there were
119.8 million such shareholder accounts, or nearly two accounts
per family.24
Mutual funds are a new name for an old idea. Investment com-
panies arose in the United States as early as the 1820s, though these
were not called mutual funds.25 The Massachusetts Investors
Trust, generally regarded as the first mutual fund, was created in
1924. It was different from the other investment trusts in that it pub-
lished its portfolio, promised prudent investment policies, and was
self-liquidating when investors demanded cash for their invest-
ments. But this first mutual fund got off to a slow start: investors
were not quick to appreciate its advantages. The 1920s bull mar-
ket instead saw the proliferation of many other investment trusts:
investment companies without the safeguards we associate with
mutual funds today, many of them dishonest operations and some
of them even, effectively, Ponzi schemes (see Chapter 3).
After the stock market crash of 1929, many of these became even
more worthless than the market as a whole, and the public soured
on investment trusts. In particular, they felt betrayed by the man-
agers of the trusts, who were often pursuing their own interests
in flagrant conflict with those of their investors. The Investment
CompanyAct of 1940, which established regulations for investment
companies, helped restore a measure of public confidence. But
people needed more than just government regulations; they needed
a new name, one that did not carry the unsavory associations of

investment trusts. The term mutual fund,with its similarity to the
mutual savings bank and the mutual insurance company—ven-
erable institutions that had survived the stock market crash largely
untouched by scandal—was much more reassuring and attractive
to investors.26
The mutual fund industry was given new impetus by the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, which created
Individual RetirementAccounts. But the industry really took off
after the recent bull market began in 1982.
Part of the reason that equity mutual funds proliferated so
rapidly after that date is that they are used as part of 401(k) pen-
sion plans. As people invest their plan balances directly in mutual
funds, they develop greater familiarity with the concept; they are
thus more inclined to invest their non-401(k) savings in mutual
funds as well.
Another reason for the funds’ explosive growth is that they have
paid for a great deal of advertising. Television shows, magazines,
and newspapers frequently carry advertisements for them, and
active investors receive unsolicited ads in the mail. Mutual funds
encourage more naïve investors to participate in the market, by lead-
ing them to think that the experts managing the funds will steer
them away from pitfalls.
The proliferation of equity mutual funds has therefore focused
public attention on the market, with the effect of encouraging
speculative price movements in stock market aggregates, rather
than in individual stocks.27 The emerging popular concept that
mutual fund investing is sound, convenient, and safe has encour-
aged many investors who were once afraid of the market to want
to enter it, thereby contributing to an upward thrust in the mar-
ket. (See Chapter 10 for a further discussion of public attitudes
toward mutual funds.)
The Decline of Inflation and the Effects of Money Illusion
The outlook for U.S. inflation, as measured by the percentage
change in the Consumer Price Index, has gradually improved since
the bull market began. In 1982, even though U.S. inflation was then

PRECIPITATING FACTORS 37
around 4% a year, there was still considerable uncertainty as to
whether it would return to the high level (nearly 15% for the year)
experienced in 1980. The most dramatic stock price increases of this
bull market occurred once the inflation rate had settled down into
the 2–3% range in the mid-1990s, and it then dropped below 2%.
The general public pays a lot of attention to inflation, as I dis-
covered in my interview studies of public attitudes toward it.28
People widely believe that the inflation rate is a barometer of the
economic and social health of a nation. High inflation is perceived
as a sign of economic disarray, of a loss of basic values, and a dis-
grace to the nation, an embarrassment before foreigners. Low infla-
tion is viewed as a sign of economic prosperity, social justice, and
good government. It is not surprising, therefore, that a lower infla-
tion rate boosts public confidence, hence stock market valuation.
But from a purely rational standpoint, this stock market reac-
tion to inflation is inappropriate. In 1979 Nobel laureate Franco
Modigliani, with Richard Cohn, published an article arguing that
the stock market reacts inappropriately to inflation because people
do not fully understand the effect of inflation on interest rates.29
When inflation is high—as it was when they wrote, near the bot-
tom of the stock market in 1982—nominal interest rates (the usual
interest rates we see quoted every day) are high because they must
compensate investors for the inflation that is eroding the value of
their dollars. Yet real interest rates (interest rates as corrected for
the effects of inflation) were not high then, and therefore there
should not have been any stock market reaction to the high nom-
inal rates. Modigliani and Cohn suggested that the market tends
to be depressed when nominal rates are high even when real rates
are not high because of a sort of “money illusion,” or public con-
fusion about the effects of a changing monetary standard. When
there is inflation, we are changing the value of the dollar, and there-
fore changing the yardstick by which we measure values. Faced
with a changing yardstick, it is not surprising that many people
become confused.
Modigliani and Cohn also argued (and this is a more subtle point)
that people fail to take account of a bias in measured corporate prof-
its due to the fact that corporations deduct from their profits the

total interest paid on their debt, and not just the real (inflation-
corrected) interest. In inflationary times, part of this interest paid
may be viewed merely as a prepayment of part of the real debt,
rather than a cost to the company. Few investors realize this and
make corrections for this effect of inflation. Their failure to do so
may be described as another example of money illusion.30
Public misunderstanding about inflation at the present time
encourages high expectations for real (inflation-corrected) returns.
Most data on past long-run stock market returns is reported in
themedia in nominal terms, without correction for inflation, and
people might naturally be encouraged to expect that such nomi-
nal returns would continue in the future. Inflation today is under
2%, compared with a historical average Consumer Price Index level
of inflation that has averaged 4.4% a year since John Kennedy was
elected president in 1960. Therefore expecting the same nominal
returns we have seen in the stock market since 1960 is expecting
a lot more in real terms.
Plots of historical stock price indexes in the media are almost
invariably shown in nominal terms, not the real inflation-corrected
terms shown in the figures in this book. Consumer prices have
increased six-fold since 1960 and seventeen-fold since 1913. This
inflation imparts an strong upward trend to long-run historical plots
of stock price indexes, if they are not corrected for inflation. Thus
the extraordinary behavior of the real stock market at the turn of
the millennium, the spike up in stock prices that was visible in Fig-
ure 1.1, does not stand out in the long historical plots we see in
the media. In fact, viewing these plots encourages us to think that
nothing at all unusual is going on now in the stock market.
The reason news writers generally do not make corrections for
inflation is probably that they think such adjustments are esoteric
and would not be widely appreciated by their readers.And they
are probably right. The general public has not by and large taken
Economics 101, and those who did sit through it have probably for-
gotten much of what they learned. Thus they have not assimilated
the basic lesson that there is nothing natural about measuring
prices in dollars when the quantity, and value, of those dollars has

been highly unstable. The public at large does not fully appreciate
that the more meaningful measure of the stock market level is in
terms of some broad basket of goods, as the level is measured if
it is corrected for consumer price inflation.31
Expansion of the Volume of Trade: Discount Brokers,
Day Traders, and Twenty-Four-Hour Trading
The turnover rate (the total shares sold in a year divided by the total
number of shares) for New York Stock Exchange stocks nearly
doubled between 1982 and 1999, from 42% to 78%.32 The NASDAQ
market, which emphasizes high-technolgoy stocks, shows an even
greater turnover rate increase, from 88% in 1990 to 221% in 1999.33
The higher turnover rate may be symptomatic of increased inter-
est in the market as a result of other factors mentioned here. But
another reason for the rising turnover rate in the stock market is
the declining cost of making a trade. After competitive brokerage
commissions were mandated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) in 1975, there was an immediate drop in com-
mission rates, and discount brokers came into being. Technolog-
ical and organizational changes were also set in motion. Such
innovations as the Small Order Execution System, introduced by
NASDAQ in 1985, and new order handling rules issued by the SEC
in 1997 have resulted in everlower trading costs. SEC regulations
encouraging equal access to the markets have now spawned a
growing number of amateur investors who can “day trade,” that
is, try to make profits by rapidly trading stocks using the same order
execution systems used by professionals.
The significant growth of online trading services coincides
roughly with the most spectacular increases in the stock market
since 1997. According to a study by the SEC, there were 3.7 mil-
lion online accounts in the United States in 1997; by 1999 there were
9.7 million such accounts.34The growth of online trading, as well
as the associated Internet-based information and communication ser-
vices, may well encourage minute-by-minute attention to the mar-
ket.After-hours trading on the exchanges also has the potential to

==================================================

40 STRUCTURAL FACTORS
increase the level of attention paid to the market, as investors can
track changing prices in their living rooms during their leisure time.
Speculative prices seem to get a volatility nudge whenever
markets are open. The magnitude of price changes tends to be lower
over two-day intervals that include a day when markets are closed
(as, for example, during a time when the New York Stock Exchange
closed on Wednesdays).35It is therefore plausible to expect that the
expansion of online trading and the opening of markets for longer
hours will raise their volatility. Whether it will raise or lower the
level of prices is less certain.
There is, however, some evidence suggesting that more frequent
exposure to price quotes might in fact diminish demand for stocks.
Economists Shlomo Benartzi and Richard Thaler have shown that
the time pattern of attention to market prices can have important
effects on the demand for stocks. In experimental situations, if
people are shown daily data on stock prices they express much less
interest in investing in stocks than if they are shown only longer-
run returns.36Witnessing the day-to-day noise in stock prices appar-
ently encourages more fear about the inherent risk of investing in
stocks. Thus institutional innovations that encourage viewing the
market price more frequently might tend to depress the price
level of the market.
On the other hand, the increased frequency of reporting of stock
prices caused by recent institutional and technological changes may
have just the opposite effect to that observed in the experimental
situation crafted by Benartzi and Thaler. In a nonexperimental
setting, where people’s focus of attention is not controlled by an
experimenter, the increased frequency of price observations may
tend to increase the demand for stocks by attracting attention to them.
And changing public attention is a critical factor in the valuation
of investments, a point that will be elaborated in Chapter 8.
The Rise of Gambling Opportunities
There has been a dramatic increase in gambling opportunities in
the United States in recent years. Most forms of gambling and lot-
teries were outlawed by states in the 1870s after a scandal in the

Louisiana lottery, and the Louisiana national lottery itself was
effectively shut down by an 1890 act of Congress prohibiting the
sale of lottery tickets by mail. From then until 1970, opportunities
to gamble legally were confined largely to racetracks, a form of
gambling that has limited public appeal and which at the time
required travel to a racetrack. But by 1975, there were thirteen state
lotteries, and by 1999 there were thirty-seven, offering very con-
venient and easy means of wagering. Until 1990, legalized casinos
operated only in Nevada and Atlantic City. By 1999 there were
nearly 100 riverboat and dockside casinos and 260 casinos on
Indian reservations. Over the same interval, betting at racetracks
has also expanded dramatically, with the development of off-track
betting, relying on satellite broadcasts of the races. Cable and Inter-
net wagering on races is now possible from home. There has also
been a proliferation of electronic gambling devices, including slot
machines, video poker, video keno, and other stand-alone devices.
In some states these may even be found at truck stops, convenience
stores, and lottery outlets. The ubiquity and convenience of gam-
bling opportunities, and the strength of the marketing campaign
undertaken to promote gambling, are unprecedented in U.S. his-
tory.According to the 1999 report of the National Gambling Impact
Study Commission, 125 million Americans gambled in 1998—a
figure that represents most of the adult population.37 Moreover,
7.5 million Americans were estimated to be either problem or
pathological gamblers.
The rise of gambling institutions, and the increased frequency
of actual gambling, have potentially important effects on our cul-
ture and on changed attitudes toward risk taking in other areas, such
as investing in the stock market. The legalization of gambling in
the form of state lotteries has sometimes been observed to help the
illegal numbers business, rather than replace it,38and thus it might
also promote other capricious risk-taking activities. Gambling
suppresses natural inhibitions against taking risks, and some of
the gambling contracts, in particular the lotteries, superficially
resemble financial markets: one deals with a computer, one
receivesa certificate (the lottery ticket), and, in the case of the so-
called mega-lottos, one participates in a much-talked-about national

phenomenon. Having established a habit of participating in such
gambling, it would be natural to graduate to its more upscale form,
speculation in securities.
The period of highest U.S. stock market volatility was 1929 to
1933, when volatility was more than twice as high as had ever been
recorded before. This period of volatility occurred during a “gam-
bling craze” that was brought on not by legalization but by the orga-
nized crime that was inadvertently created by the prohibition of
alcoholic beverages during the period 1920–33.39 The criminal
gangsthat grew after 1920 to satisfy the nation’s thirst for alcohol
found it natural to branch out into numbers games or speakeasy
versions of craps and roulette. Organized crime developed a
modern and efficient distribution, marketing, and retail system to
supply the nation at large with liquor, going far beyond its tradi-
tional neighborhood strongholds, and this same infrastructure
served to facilitate illegal gambling activities on a much larger scale.
Certainly the widespread disrespect for the law fostered by Pro-
hibition helped legitimize gambling.
Aspillover from gambling to financial volatility may come about
because gambling, and the institutions that promote it, yield an
inflated estimate of one’s own ultimate potential for good luck, a
heightened interest in how one performs compared with others,
and a new way to stimulate oneself out of a feeling of boredom or
monotony. Today we are constantly subjected to highly professional
advertisements that try to foster such attitudes, even radio and tele-
vision advertisements that depict typical gamblers’ self-justifications
as expressed by professional actors. These marketing efforts, and
the experience of gambling or seeing others gamble, may well have
the effect of encouraging frivolous risk-taking behavior in the stock
market as well. Such ads may be startlingly explicit. AConnecti-
cut billboard advertising off-track betting touts it, in big letters, as
being “Like the Stock Market, Only Faster.”
Summing Up
Looking back at the list of potential precipitating factors for the stock
market boom, it is worth remembering that there is no air-tight

PRECIPITATING FACTORS 43
science of stock market pricing. Economists have certainly made
progress in understanding financial markets, but the complexity
of real life continues to prevail.
Many of the foregoing factors have a self-fulfilling aspect to
them, and they are thus difficult, if not impossible, to capture in
predictive scientific explanations. Yet many of them also have
indisputable markers. The Internet boom, the rise of online trad-
ing, the Republican Congress, and the proposed capital gains tax
cut occurred just as the market started its most breathtaking
ascent. Other factors—including the rise of defined contribution
pension plans, the growth of mutual funds, the decline of inflation,
and the expansion of the volume of trade—were clearly associated
with events that unfolded since the bottom of the market in 1982.
Beyond these, our culture clearly reflects further developments that
have accompanied the surge in stocks. For example, studies reveal
that the degree of materialism has risen steadily in the past gen-
eration, that patriotic zeal following the demise of Communism
has contributed to our confidence in the capitalist system, and per-
haps most interestingly, that gambling has been on the rise dur-
ing the 1990s. Many of these factors are present in Europe and in
other countries as well as the United States, and so a theory that
they are responsible for the stock market boomin the United States
is not inconsistent with the fact that the boom is shared substan-
tially by these other countries.40
Correlation is certainly not causation, nor should it be con-
strued as such. But when exuberance, irrational or otherwise, is the
order of the day, it is essential to take account of the self-fulfilling
psychology of stocks in making the policy decisions that will
affect our society for decades to come.

Three
Amplification Mechanisms:
Naturally Occurring Ponzi Processes
In the previous chapter we ex-
amined a number of disparate
factors that have precipitated the present speculative bubble. In
this chapter we consider how the effect of these factors is ampli-
fied by mechanisms involving investor confidence, investor expec-
tations for future market performance, and related influences on
investor demand for stocks. To provide context and concreteness,
we shall first examine evidence about investor confidence and
expectations.
The amplification mechanisms work through a sort of feed-
back loop; later in this chapter they will also be described as a type
of naturally occurring Ponzi process. Investors, their confidence
and expectations buoyed by past price increases, bid up stock
prices further, thereby enticing more investors to do the same, so
that the cycle repeats again and again, resulting in an amplified
response to the original precipitating factors. The feedback mech-
anism is widely mentioned in popular discourse as merely a
hypothesis, often regarded as unproven. In fact, there is some evi-
dence in support of such a feedback mechanism, as we shall see.

High Investor Confidence
Astriking feature of the recent bull market has been the high lev-
els of investor confidence in the stock market. My 1999 mail ques-
tionnaire survey of random samples of wealthy individuals in the
United States showed that most people believe that stocks are
the best investment for the long run.1One of the questions on the
survey, and the 1999 results from 147 respondents, were as follows:
Do you agree with the following statement? “The stock market is
the best investment for long-term holders, who can just buy and hold
through the ups and downs of the market.”
1. Strongly agree 76%
2. Agree somewhat 20%
3. Neutral 2%
4. Disagree somewhat 1%
5. Strongly disagree 1%
Agreement with this question is obviously very strong. Fully 96%
of the respondents agreed at least somewhat in 1999. The percentage
who agreed strongly in 1999 is also remarkably high, at 76%. I also
asked this question of wealthy individuals in 1996, and the results
were only slightly less dramatic then: of the 134 respondents, 94%
agreed at least somewhat, and 69% agreed strongly.
A96% level of agreement on just about any survey question
isremarkable, and it is all the more so on a question about some-
thing as personal as investing strategy.2 Many people used to
think (for example, in the 1970s and 1980s) that real estate was the
best investment or (for example, in making decisions about invest-
ments for retirement before the recent bull market) that government
bonds were the best investment.3One might have thought that more
than a few of the respondents would believe that investing in gold
or diamonds or other commodities, investing in antiques or art, or
even investing in education or self-improvement would be the best
strategy. But no: almost all agree on the stock market.
Associated with this view is a feeling that the stock market is a
very safe place. Another question on the survey, and the 1999
results from 147 respondents, were as follows:



==================================================
                     PAGE 69                      
==================================================

46 STRUCTURAL FACTORS
How much do you agree with this statement? “If there is another
crash like October 19, 1987, the market will surely be back up to its
former levels in a couple years or so.”
1. Strongly agree 47%
2. Agree somewhat 44%
3. Neutral 3%
4. Disagree somewhat 5%
5. Strongly disagree 1%
There is an overwhelming tendency to show concord with this
statement: 91% of the wealthy individual investors agreed at
least somewhat in 1999. Almost no one really disagrees, as they
should if they believe that markets are unpredictable. When I
asked this same question of wealthy individuals in 1996, there were
135 answers, and of these 82% agreed at least somewhat.
It is curious that people do not seem to believe in the con-
verse of the premise of the above question: they do not believe that
the market will surely go back down in a couple of years if it goes
up dramatically, as it has done recently.4 Their belief in the
resilience of the market seems to stem from a generalized feeling
of optimism and assurance, rather than a belief in the long-run sta-
bility of prices.
Here, then, captured in the responses to these two questions, we
see the extraordinary public confidence in the stock market that
underlies recent market valuations. People seem to think that they
have discovered a safe and lucrative investment, one that cannot
lose. They perceive no real downside risk, and this explains their
willingness to buy stocks even when, by conventional measures
such as price-earnings ratios, they are so greatly overvalued.
Although I have been surveying investors since the mid-1980s,
it did not occur to me to ask these questions until 1996. I suppose
I did not think to ask before then whether investors thought a stock
market crash would surely be reversed because such highly opti-
mistic investor thinking was not so flagrantly in evidence then. So
I have no way to prove that the public did not believe even back
then that any stock market crash would surely soon be reversed.
I did, however, ask a somewhat similar question starting in 1989. The
question and the 1999 results from 145 wealthy individual respon-

dents, plus the 1996 results from 132 respondents and the 1989
results from 116, were as follows:
If the Dow dropped 3% tomorrow, I would guess that the day
after tomorrow the Dow would:
1999 1996 1989
1. Increase 56% 46% 35%
2. Decrease 19% 24% 34%
3. Stay the same 12% 18% 13%
4. No opinion 13% 11% 18%
The percentage who thought in 1999 that the Dow would increase
is nearly three times the percentage who thought it would decrease.
It was not always so. In 1996, there was about a 2:1 ratio between
the percentage predicting an increase and that predicting a decrease.
In 1989, the percentage predicting an increase was about the same
as the percentage predicting a decrease. Thus, over this ten-year
interval, it is clear that there has been a sharp increase in the con-
fidence among individual investors that any one-day drop in the
market will be quickly reversed.5
There is some evidence suggesting that many people in 1929 felt
equally certain about reversals of stock market drops.Although
we do not have questionnaire survey data of the time, we do have
contemporary accounts of investor confidence. Frederick Lewis
Allen, in his 1931 history of the 1920s, Only Yesterday,wrote:
As people in the summer of 1929 looked back for precedents, they
were comforted by the recollection that every crash of the past
few years had ultimately brought prices to a new high point. Two
steps up, one step down, two steps up again—that was how the mar-
ket went. If you sold, you had only to wait for the next crash (they
came every few months) and buy in again. And there was really no
reason to sell at all: you were bound to win in the end if your stock
was sound. The really wise man, it appeared, was he who “bought
and held on.”6
Some Reflections on Investor Confidence
It is important to consider the nature, and likely sources, of this
current investor confidence, not only to understand the present

situation but also to lead us into a discussion, later in this chap-
ter, of feedback loops. We will see that the feedback that reinforces
investor confidence occurs in the context of a complex social and
psychological environment.
Where did people get the idea that, if there is ever a crash, the
market is sure to rise to past levels within a couple of years or so?
History certainly does not suggest this. There are many examples
of markets that have done poorly over long intervals of time. To
pick just one from recent memory, the Nikkei index in Japan is still
selling at less than half its peak value in 1989. Other examples are
the periods after the 1929 and 1966 stock market peaks discussed
in Chapter 1. But these examples of persistent bad performance in
the stock market are not prominent in the public mind.
One reason that the recent domestic market performance is
more prominent in investors’ minds is simply that they have expe-
riencedthese domestic stock prices every day; they have watched
and reacted to a rising U.S. market since 1982. U.S. investors today
have not had the same experience with Japanese stocks, or with
the U.S. market in decades past. Many people fix their attention
on plots of rising stock prices in newspapers every day, and they
seem to come away with an intuitive feeling that every decline is
reversed, to be followed swiftly by new highs. The same human
pattern-recognition faculty that we used when we learned to ride
a bike or to drive a car, giving us an intuitive sense of what to expect
next, has been applied to our expectations for the market. For
investors in their twenties, thirties, or forties, this upward trend has
been present during most of the years they have been observing or
investing in the market.
The subjective experience over the years of seeing stock market
declines consistently reverse themselves has a psychological impact
on our thinking that is hard to appreciate, or reconstruct, after the
fact. Those who thought the market would go down and stay down
became sensitized to their bad feelings from being repeatedly
wrong, year after year. Those who consistently predicted a decline
became painfully aware of a loss of reputation from being so wrong
so often. Since our satisfaction with our views of the world is part
of our self-esteem and personal identity, it is natural for the for-

merly pessimistic to want to settle on a different view, or at least
to present themselves to the public with a different theme. Thus
the changed emotional environment will have an impact on their
views—or certainly the expression of them—that is independent
of any objective evidence supporting or refuting those views.
Even if they have not personally paid attention to the stock mar-
ket since 1982, today’s investors are living in a time and place where
recitations of the feelings of others who have experienced the mar-
ketare heard regularly. It is helpful, to appreciate this sense, to quote
one person’s argument against market timing, from the 1999 book
Dow 40,000by David Elias:
An example of what can happen when an individual waits for the
Dow to indicate “the perfect time” to invest is the saga of Joe, a friend
of mine. Joe started calling me in 1982 when the Dow was just over
1000, looking for the right time to get into equities. Over the years,
he continued to seek a pullback that would be his perfect moment.
Today, at age 62, Joe still has his money parked in bank CDs. He has
missed the entire bull market and all its thousand-point milestones.
Even now, Joe does not realize that there never is a perfect time. When
the market recovers from a pullback, it generally goes to new highs.7
There is something superficially convincing about this passage, espe-
cially when it is combined, as in the next paragraph in Elias’s
book, with illustrations of the power of compound interest when
returns are high (as they have recently been in the stock market),
suggesting that the stock market is your chance to become really
and truly rich. The tale has emotional immediacy, as would a story
about a driving mistake that led to a serious accident or a story about
the advantages of asking the boss for a raise.
Arelated reason why an argument built around such a story has
such appeal is that—by presenting successful investing as a process
of mastering one’s own internal impulses rather than taking
account of our present situation in history—it invites the reader
to forget what is special about the present time in terms of the level
of the market. Normal people think a lot about controllingtheir own
impulses—for example, about disciplining themselves to good
work rather than dissipation, about staying slim rather than get-
ting fat—and so arguments that appeal to such self-control have more

resonance than articles about the history of price-earnings ratios.
The appeal of Elias’s argument is also that it calls to mind the pain
of regret, the emotional reasons we have for investing now,a point
to which I will return later in this chapter. When arguments become
so detached from an analysis of historical data, the only impact on
people’s thinking made by actual data is a vague sense, from
casual inspection of very recent data, that the market has always
reversed declines.
Many media accounts routinely tell stories about the satisfac-
tion felt by those who have invested in stocks in years past, with
the clear suggestion to the reader that “you can do it too.” To cite
only one among numerous examples, a 1999 article in USAWeek-
end,a national Sunday magazine insert for newspapers, carried an
article entitled “How to (Really) Get Rich in America.” The article
gives examples of investor successes and offers the hypothetical
story of a twenty-two-year-old college graduate earning $30,000
a year with annual real income raises of 1%. “If she saved only 10%
of her income and invested the savings in an S&P index fund
she’d have a net worth of $1.4 million on retirement at age 67, in
today’s dollars.”8These calculations assume that the S&Pindex fund
earns a riskless 8% real (inflation-corrected) return. There is no
mentionof the possibility that the return might not be so high over
time, and that she might notend up a millionaire.An article with
a very similar title, “Everybody Ought to Be Rich,” appeared in
the Ladies’Home Journalin 1929.9It performed some very similar
calculations, yet similarly omitted to describe the possibility that
anything could go wrong in the long term. The article became noto-
rious after the 1929 crash.
These seemingly convincing discussions of potential increases
in the stock market are rarely offered in the abstract, but instead
in the context of stories about successful or unsuccessful investors,
and often with an undertone suggesting the moral superiority of
those who invested well. Astrong public admiration for those who
make money patiently and slowly, unfazed by market fluctuations,
has evolved. It is a theme developed in many popular books.
Notable among these is The Millionaire Next Door: The Surprising
Secrets of America’s Wealthyby Thomas Stanley and William Danko,

which was on the New York Times hardcover best-seller list for
eighty-eight weeks after its publication in 1996 and continues on
the Times paperback best-seller list as of this writing. The book,
which extols the virtues of patience and frugality, has sold over a
million copies.
Indeed such stories of patient investing transcend U.S. borders.
In Germany, the 1999 best-seller The Road to Financial Freedom: A
Millionaire in Seven Yearsby Bodo Schäfer sets a seven-year horizon
for investors and gives as the first of ten “golden rules” the dictum
that any stock market decline must soon be reversed.Another Ger-
man book from 1999, No Fear of the Next Crash: Why Stocks Are
Unbeatable as Long-Term Investmentsby Bernd Niquet, devotes itself
entirely to the theme that patient investing in stocks always wins.10
In viewing the popular expressions of confidence in the market,
whether from the 1990s or the 1920s, and in trying to understand
how people felt about them at the time, it is important to bear in mind
that in most cases the statements of confidence in the stock mar-
ket that we see are not the focal point of attention in the contexts
in which they appear. Thus, for example, Suze Orman, a highly suc-
cessful investment adviser in the 1990s and a best-selling author,
with books like The 9 Steps to Financial Freedom (1997) and The
Courage to Be Rich:Creating a Life of Material and Spiritual Abundance
(1999), has built a remarkable reputation for herself on television,
appearing often on shows like Oprah Winfrey’s, by stressing the
emotional and spiritual steps one should take to acquire a fortune.
Her concrete advice is to get out of debt and into stocks, and her
example of the power of compound interest with a rate of return
of 10% is never the focus of attention. Most of her audience is appar-
ently interested in her spiritual message, and her confronting their
difficulty in saving is on target and attention-grabbing for them. Her
assumption that the market will surely produce a return of 10% a
year is mere background information that her viewers and readers
do not have the time or the inclination to examine. Yet the repeti-
tion that she and others like her give to this assumption nonethe-
less promotes it to the status of conventional wisdom.
Other factors lie behind today’s strong investor confidence—
factors that only muddy their thinking. An important one has been

theinexorable rise in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), noted in the
preceding chapter, which has put upward pressure on all prices,
thereby tending to wipe out nominal declines in any speculative
market. The inflation consequently disguises the fact that in real
inflation-corrected terms the speculative asset may not have
regained its real value. People no doubt think back to the experi-
ence they have had with their homes. In the northeast United
States, for example, where home prices declined at the beginning
of the 1990s, home prices in many regions are back up to their
1988–90 peaks. People tend to forget that we have had 25–30% infla-
tion in the CPI since then, so that real (inflation-corrected) home
values are still way down. Of course, with today’s lower inflation
this feeling should be diminished, but people still have memories
of higher-inflation environments, and they will have them for some
time to come. The present situation, with sharply lower but still
positive inflation, may be especially conducive to high market val-
uation: people are optimistic for the future economy because of low
inflation, but they are still expecting the same tendency for stock
prices to rebound from falls that they showed during inflationary
periods.
Another important factor is the current economic expansion, the
longest such peacetime expansion in U.S. history. Those who pre-
dicted a recession have been almost as soundly discredited as
those who predicted a stock market drop, and this only serves as
further intuitive confirmation of an optimistic view for the mar-
ket. Indeed the evidence we see of public confidence in the stock
market mirrors evidence of confidence in the overall economy. The
consumer confidence measures of both the Conference Board and
the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan have been
close to record levels in recent years.
Evidence for Undiminished Expectations
Despite a High Market
In my surveys of investors, I have found that the current high mar-
ket has not diminished average expectations. I ask investors, in
open-ended questions, for their expectations for the Dow for var-



==================================================

ious horizons. I do not ask them to select from categories or ranges
of price increase; they must come up with a number on their own,
without my suggesting anything. In my surveys of high-income
individual investors, in 1989, the average expected one-year-ahead
change in the Dow was 0.6%. In 1996, it was 5.0%, and in 1999, it
was 4.6%, about the same as in 1996. Thus, despite a sharply rising
stock market over the past decade, average expectations among
high-income individual investors have on the whole also been ris-
ing since 1989. Among institutional investors, I find no particular
trend to expectations for one-year-ahead stock market returns, and
so they too are not becoming discouraged by the higher market.
Some might be surprised at how modest the average reported
expectations are today. Looking at the individual answers, it is obvi-
ous why the averages are so low. Most investors are answering that
the market will increase something like 10–15% over the next year,
which is roughly the average historical nominal return over the last
fifty years. Very few of them answer that it will do better than this.
Something like a third of the individuals answer that the market
will go down, typically by 10%, some saying by 20%. Thus, given
these answers, the averageof the expectations has been an approx-
imately 5% market price increase. In 1989, many more respondents
thought that the market would go down 10% or 20%, so that the
average expectation for the market was about zero.
It is not surprising that few people answer that they expect the
market to go up 20% or 30% in the next year. That is just not a
respectable answer, not something one would expect to see validated
in media accounts. The respectable thing to say is that it will con-
tinue to post the same impressive returns it has on average over the
past thirty years or more. It is equally respectable to venture that
there could be a correction—one hears that in the media, too—hence
the predictions of a decline by some respondents. Do people in fact
believe the answers they write on the questionnaire? Probably
most of them do not know what to believe, and possibly they con-
sider their own answers as good as anything else to believe.
The PaineWebber/Gallup polls have reported much more
optimistic average expectations among individual investors. Their
July 1999 surveys showed that these investors expected on average

a 15.0% return on the stock market over the next twelve months.
This sounds like quite an optimistic expectation, much higher
than that in my surveys. The difference in results may have to do
with subtle differences in wording. Their question was: “Think-
ing about the stock market more generally, what overall rate of
return do you think the stock market will provide investors dur-
ing the coming twelve months?” Mine was: “How much of a
change in percentage terms do you expect in the following (use
−
a + before your number to indicate an expected increase, a to
indicate an expected decrease, leave blanks where you do not
know)” and the questionnaire then provided spaces to give answers
for the Dow Jones Industrial Average for one month, three months,
six months, one year, and ten years. Note the different sounds of
the two questions. PaineWebber/Gallup asks respondents for a per-
centage return. Perhaps this suggests to their respondents that a
return should be a positive number. I ask for a percentage change
in price. My question mentions the possibility that the answer could
be negative. Answers to survey questions can be sensitive to the
wording of those questions (although if the wording is kept
unchanged over time on the questionnaires, the changes in the
answers over time may be indicative of the direction of changes
in expectations).
MontgomeryAsset Management carried out quarterly surveys
of mutual fund investors in 1998 that were widely reported in the
press as having found yet more extravagant expectations for the
stock market. One survey concluded that expectations were for 34%
annual returns on average for the next ten years. However, their
methodology was apparently flawed, as was revealed in a Wall Street
Journalarticle.11The question they posed to interviewees did not
make it clear whether they should give an annual return for the
next ten years or the ten-year total return.Atotal return of 34% for
the next ten years would be on the order of 3% a year, not a high
expectation. Moreover, their reported median expectation was only
15% a year, and so their reported 34% a year average expectation
must have been caused by a few wild answers that brought the
average up.
Overall expectations for the market among most investors are
therefore not so extravagantly high as suggested by some polls. But

expectations do appear to be somewhat higher and at least remain
as strong as they were in 1989, despite a very high market.
Some Reflections on Investor Expectations and Emotions
Economists usually like to model people as calculating optimally
their investment decisions based on expectations of future price
changes and estimates of the risk in alternative investments. How-
ever, in fact, the typical investor’s actual decision about how much
to allocate to the stock market overall, and into other asset classes
such as bonds, real estate, or other investments, tends not to be
based on careful calculations. Investors are not often assembling
forecasts for these different asset class returns and weighing these
against measured risks.
Part of the reason they are not is that investors more often feel
that experts have little or no idea what to expect of future price
changes for these asset classes, or how much risk there is in each.
After all, experts disagree all the time, and one might easily con-
clude that there is no great loss in ignoring what they are currently
saying about the outlook for any given asset class. Investors must
therefore base their judgments on basic principles on which most
experts seem always to agree.
The evidence used by experts to predict the relative returns on
broad asset classes has little immediacy for most people. Experts
talk about the potential actions of the Federal Reserve Board in Wash-
ington, about shifts in the Phillips curve, or about distortions on
aggregate earnings caused by inflation and conventional account-
ing procedures. Most individuals have little interest in such esoterica.
And yet investors must make some decisions. What factors might
then enter into one’s mind when making a decision about how
muchto put into the stock market? The feeling that the stock mar-
ket is “the only game in town,” in some emotional sense, might play
a pivotal role at this point in the decision making.
One knows that the stock market couldrepeat the performance
of recent years. That possibility seems quite real, just as real as the
possibility of a major correction in the market. But how does one
feel about the decision at this point? How does one feel, for
example, when one knows, late at night, that it is time to fill out

the 401(k) allocation form, and one is tired and annoyed by the
necessity to make such an important decision based on so little solid
information?
How one feels certainly depends on one’s recent experience in
investing. If one has been out of the market and has not partici-
pated in the profits that others have recently enjoyed, one may be
feeling a sharp pain of regret.And regret is an emotion that, psy-
chologists have found, provides considerable motivation.12Envy
of others who may have made more in the stock market than one
earned at work in the past year is a related painful feeling, espe-
cially so in that it diminishes one’s ego. If these people who made
so much in the market were really smarter and knew better, then
one really feels like a laggard. Even if they were not smarter, just
lucky—smiled on by God—it may not feel much better. One may
feel that if one can participate in just one more year of an advanc-
ing stock market—assuming it advances for another year—that will
help assuage the pain. Of course, one also thinks that the market may
well go down. But how does one weigh the potential emotional
expense of such a possible loss at the time that one is making the
asset allocation decision?
Perhaps one feels that the potential loss will not be much more
diminishing to one’s ego than the failure to participate has already
been. Of course, one likely realizes that one takes the risk of enter-
ing the market just as it begins a downward turn. But the psy-
chological cost of such a potential future loss may not be so much
greater relative to the very real regret at having been out of the mar-
ket in the past. Therefore—although there are many other ways to
deal with the thought that one is a “loser,” such as rediscovering
the importance of being a good friend, spouse, or parent, or pur-
suing the simple things in life—it may well end up that the only
really emotionally satisfying decision to make now is to get into
the stock market.
Of course if one has been in the stock market, and is deciding
today whether to stay in the market, one has a very different
emotional frame of mind. One feels satisfaction and probably some
pride in one’s past successes, and one certainly feels wealthier. One
may feel as gamblers do after they have raked in winnings: that

one is “playing with the house money” and therefore has nothing
to lose emotionally by wagering again.13
The emotional state of investors when they decide on their invest-
ments is no doubt one of the most important factors causing the
bull market. Although their emotional state may be in part a con-
sequence of the factors described in the previous chapter, such as
the rise of materialistic sentiment and individualism, it is also
amplified by the psychological impact of the increasingly strong
uptrend observed in the market.
Public Attention to the Market
The level of public interest in and attention to the market changes
significantly over time, just as the public’s interest jumps from one
newsworthy topic to another.Attention shifts from news stories
about Jacqueline Kennedy to stories about O. J. Simpson to stories
about Princess Diana. Interest in the stock market goes through fads
in just the same way, depending on the story quality of the precip-
itating events.
Some writers have indicated that 1929 was a time of dramati-
cally heightened investor attention to the stock market. John Ken-
neth Galbraith, in his book The Great Crash: 1929,wrote:
By the summer of 1929 the market not only dominated the news.
It also dominated the culture. That recherché minority which at
other times has acknowledged its interest in Saint Thomas Aquinas,
Proust, psychoanalysis and psychosomatic medicine then spoke of
United Corporation, United Founders and Steel. Only the most
aggressive of the eccentrics maintained their detachment from the
market and their interest in autosuggestion or communism. Main
Street had always had one citizen who could speak knowingly
about buying or selling stocks. Now he became an oracle.14
That public attention was focused on the stock market in the late
1920s is supported by many other such commentaries. One should
bear in mind that Galbraith’s argument contains some journalis-
tic overstatement that he no doubt could not have gotten away with
had he been writing in the 1920s. But Galbraith is on the right track
in terms of the direction of change over the 1920s.

If one looks at the Reader’s Guide to Periodical Literatureyear by
year throughout the 1920s, one sees that only a tiny percentage of
the articles in periodicals, always less than 0.1%, were about the
stock market in any given year. People were thinking about plenty
of other things besides the market. However, the percentage of
articles concerning the stock market grew markedly over the course
of the decade. There were 29 articles about the stock market in
1922–24, or 0.025% of all articles listed; 67 articles in 1925–28, or
0.035% of all articles listed; and 182 articles in 1929–32, or 0.093%
of all articles listed. Thus over the 1920s the percentage of articles
about the stock market almost quadrupled.
We see a similar pattern of changed interest in the stock mar-
ket from an identical study of the Reader’s Guidein the recent bull
market, although the percentage of articles that are about the stock
market is higher throughout this period than in the 1920s. In 1982,
at the bottom of the stock market, there were 242 articles about the
stock market, or 0.194% of all articles. In 1987, the year of the crash,
there were 592 articles, or 0.364% of all articles, almost twice as
many.After the crash, interest waned again, and there were only
255 articles, or 0.171% of all articles, in 1990. In 1996, 1997, and 1998
the number of articles rose again, to 580 articles in 1998, or 0.293%
of all articles.
Another source of evidence on investor attention to the market
is the number of investment clubs, as reported by the National Asso-
ciation of Investors Corporation (NAIC). Investment clubs are
small social groups, typically meeting at members’ homes in the
evening, that together invest small sums of money for fun and for
the purpose of learning about investments. The NAIC was founded
in 1951 by four investor clubs at the beginning of the 1950s bull mar-
ket; the number of clubs grew to 953 by 1954, reached a peak of
14,102 in 1970 (near the top of the market), and fell with the mar-
ket to 3,642 in 1980 (near the bottom of the market). Now the num-
ber of clubs is up well beyond its prior peak, to 37,129.15Thecrude
conformity of the number of investment clubs to the performance
of the market is noteworthy, suggesting that investors’ attention
is indeed attracted by bull markets.

==================================================

AMPLIFICATION MECHANISMS 59
Further evidence that past successes in the market encourage
attention to the market can be seen in the behavior of the volume
of sales in the stock market. Volume of sales, measured by dollar
trading volume over total market value on the New York Stock
Exchange, rose sharply in the early years of the bull market after
1982, but declined for a couple of years after the 1987 crash, there-
after to resume its upward path. Economists Meir Statman and
Steven Thorley have shown with a statistical analysis that high
returns in the stock market continue to promote high volume for
many months afterward, and that while high volatility in market
prices also promotes volume of trade, the effect of volatility on vol-
ume of trade is more transient. Statman and Thorley conclude
thatthis persistent effect of returns on volume is due to the impact
of higher returns on investor confidence.16Even though a rising
market “lifts all boats,” there is still a tendency for investors to inter-
pret their investing success as confirmation of their own abilities,
and this reinforces their interest in trading stocks.
When people experience success in any area, there is of course
a natural tendency for them to take new initiatives and develop
their skills in hopes of achieving more such success. In a study of
investors who switched from phone to online trading, comparing
them with investors who continued to use telephones to make their
trades, economists Brad Barber and Terrance Odean found that the
switchers on average had beat the market by over 2% a year.After
they went on line, these switchers traded more speculatively and
actively, and then proceeded to lag the market by more than 3%
annually.17This finding may be interpreted as showing that over-
confidence from past success encouraged people to expend the
fixed cost of learning about online trading. Having acquired these
capabilities and interests, they are likely to pay greater attention
to the market for a sustained period, measured in years, in order
to see their skills investment “pay off.”
If one watches casually for discussions of the stock market, they
typically come at some point during a dinner party, cookout, or
other social event. Bringing up the stock market is seen as an
accepted, even mildly exciting, conversational gambit. It is an

agreeable topic. Twenty years ago, bringing up the stock market
at such an occasion would have seemed like an intrusion, a faux
pas, a poorly judged attempt to mix business with pleasure. The
difference between now and then is subtle, but nevertheless rev-
elatory of the fundamental change in investor enthusiasm for the
market.
Feedback Theories of Bubbles
In feedback loop theory, initial price increases (caused, for example,
by the kinds of precipitating factors described in the previous
chapter) lead to more price increases as the effects of the initial price
increases feed back into yet higher prices through increased investor
demand. This second round of price increases feeds back again into
a third round, and then into a fourth, and so on. Thus the initial
impact of the precipitating factors is amplified into much larger price
increases than the factors themselves would have suggested. Such
feedback loops may be a factor not only in the historic bull and bear
markets for the aggregate stock market but also, with some differ-
ences in details, in the ups and downs of individual investments.
The feedback theory is, as I have noted, widely known, but most
people do not use the term feedback loopto describe it. The phrase
is a scientist’s term for what might popularly be called a vicious
circle, a self-fulfilling prophecy, a bandwagon effect. Although
the phrase speculative bubblehas more than one meaning in com-
mon discourse, it usually appears to refer to such feedback.
In the most popular version of the feedback theory, one that relies
on adaptive expectations, feedback takes place because past price
increases generate expectations of further price increases.18 In
another version of the feedback theory, feedback takes place because
of increasedinvestorconfidencein response to past price increases.
Usually, such feedback is thought to occur in response not so much
to a sudden price increase as to a pattern of consistency in price
increases.
The evidence discussed earlier in this chapter is consistent with
both the adaptive expectation and investor confidence feedback
theories playing a role in the current stock market situation. The



==================================================
                     PAGE 84                      
==================================================

AMPLIFICATION MECHANISMS 61
feedback can also occur for emotional reasons, reasons unconnected
with either expectations or confidence. The effect of “playing with
the house’s money,” as discussed previously, can result in a sort
of feedback: this frame of mind may reduce investors’ inclination
to sell after a price increase, thus amplifying the effects of the pre-
cipitating factors on price.
Economists John Campbell and John Cochrane have proposed
a theory of habit formation that may also serve to amplify stock
market responses. In their model, people become slowly habitu-
ated to the higher level of consumption that they can expect from
a more highly valued stock market. After a stock market increase,
people may be newly experimenting with higher consumption
levels, but not yet habituated to them. Investors who have made
profits in the market may be willing to take more risks, because
they still feel they could give up the higher consumption level if
investment losses forced them to do so. Again, their willingness
to hold stocks at higher prices may amplify the effects of the pre-
cipitating factors.19
Regardless of which feedback theory applies, the speculative
bubble cannot grow forever. Investors’ demand for a stock cannot
grow forever, and when it stops growing price increases will stop.
According to the popular version of the expectation feedback
theory, at that point we would expect a drop in the market for the
stock, a bursting of the bubble, since investors no longer think prices
will continue to rise and therefore no longer see a good reason to
hold the stock. However, other versions of the feedback theory do
not suggest a sudden bursting of the bubble, since they are not pred-
icated on continually increasing prices.
Indeed, even according to the most popular versions of the
feedback theory, there is actually no reason to think that there should
be sudden bursts of bubbles. There must be some noise in investor
demand, some unpredictability of response to past price changes,
some lack of synchrony across investors. Moreover, the enticement
to enter or exit the market that past price changes create is not
likely to be determined only by the most recent change in price.
It is plausible that investors will look back over many days, weeks,
or months of price changes in deciding whether they findrecent

market performance enticing. Thus the simple feedback theory
is consistent with a price pattern that shows many interruptions
and jiggles.20
With any of these feedback theories, it would also seem that
negative bubbles should occur, in which feedback occurs in a
downward direction, as initial price declines discourage some
investors, causing further price declines, and so on.21 (The term
negative bubblealways reminds me of watching a sealed plastic soda
bottle filled with warm air gradually implode as it cools, and see-
ing it pop back into shape when the cap is loosened—though this
metaphor is really no more apt than the soap bubble metaphor for
the positive speculative events.) Price continues to decline until fur-
ther price decreases begin to seem unlikely, at which point there
is no reason for people to want to stay away from the stock and
the negative bubble bursts back up—even though, as with positive
bubbles, the burst will probably not be sudden.
Feedback loop dynamics can generate complex and even appar-
ently random behavior. The so-called random number generators
in some types of computer software are really just simple nonlinear
feedback loops, and even some quite simple feedback loops have
been demonstrated to yield behavior that looks so complicated as
to suggest randomness. If we suppose that there are other kinds
offeedback loops operating in the economy, besides simple price-
increase-to-further-price-increase feedback, then we may conclude
that the apparent randomness of the stock market, the tendency
it has to create sudden moves for no apparent reason, might not be
so inexplicable after all. The branch of mathematics that studiesnon-
linear feedback loops, called chaos theory, may be applicable to
understanding the complexity of stock market behavior.22
Perceptions of Feedback and Bubbles among Investors
The feedback theory of speculative bubbles is so widely known
as to be considered part of our popular culture. It is natural to won-
der, therefore, whether public perceptions of such a bubble might
be influenced by the recent high pricing of the market. Con-

ceivably, the current bubble might exist only because people
thinkthat there is a temporary bubble and want to ride with it for
a while.
By looking at a series of indicators from my semiannual surveys
of institutional investors, I have constructed a bubble expectations index.
The indicators I look at are the percentages of the respondents
who say that the market is too high but will go up in the short term,
that the market will rise and then decline, that it is advisable to stay
in the market only for the short run, that one must be careful not
to be influenced by others’ optimism, and that the market will
increase in the short run, although the probability of a stock mar-
ket crash in the next six months is greater than 10%. Substantial per-
centages of the respondents, averaging from 10% to 50%, say these
things in answer to my questions. The bubble expectations index
shows substantial oscillations, indicating that the percentage of
institutional investors exhibiting bubble sentiment has fluctuated
over time. The level of the index seems to be related to the change
in the stock market over the prior six months, meaning that expec-
tations of a temporary bubble are higher whenever the market
has been going up more in the preceding six months. However, the
index shows no strong trend over the decade since 1989.
ABarronsBig Money Poll of professional money managers in
April 1999 asked, “Is the stock market in a speculative bubble?”
Seventy-two percent of the respondents said yes, only 28% no.23
This result may seem surprising, given that I found no substan-
tial upward trend in the bubble expectations index, but their
question is rather ambiguous, since it does not define a bubble,
and no comparison is made with earlier years. Their other survey
questions do not ask the respondents if they have bubble expec-
tations as I define them, and their survey finds relatively optimistic
expectations overall.
In fact I find little evidence that people have been thinking, dur-
ing the recent market highs at the dawn of the new millennium,
that we are in a temporary speculative bubble. The conspicuous
feature of the current high pricing is high confidence that the
market will always do well.

64 STRUCTURAL FACTORS
Ponzi Schemes as Models of Feedback
and Speculative Bubbles
It is very hard to prove that a simple mechanical price feedback
model, producing heightened investor attention and enthusiasm,
is actually a factor in financial markets. We may have a casual
impression that investors are showing enthusiasm for investments
in response to past price increases, but we do not see any concrete
evidence that such feedback actually affects their decisions.
In order to provide evidence that such feedback mechanisms do
play a role in financial markets, it is helpful to look at the example
of Ponzi schemes, or pyramid schemes, by means of which hoax-
ers create positive feedback from putative current investment
returns to future investment returns. These schemes have been per-
petrated so many times that governments have had to outlaw
them, yet they still keep popping up. They are particularly inter-
esting since they are, in a way, controlled experiments (controlled
by the hoaxer!) that demonstrate characteristics of the feedback that
cannot be seen so plainly either in normal markets or in the exper-
imental psychologist’s laboratory.
In a Ponzi scheme, the manager of the scheme promises to make
large profits for investors by investing their money. But little or no
investment of contributors’ funds in any real assets is actually made.
Instead, the manager pays off the initial investors with the proceeds
of a sale to a second round of investors, and the second round with
the proceeds from a sale to a third, and so on. The name of the
scheme derives from a particularly famous (though certainly not
the first) example, perpetrated by one Charles Ponzi in the United
States in 1920. APonzi scheme entices initial investors, after they
have made a lot of money, to tell their success stories to another
round of investors, who then invest even more in the scheme, allow-
ing the hoaxer to pay off the second round of investors, whose
success story entices an even larger round of investors, and so on.
This scheme must end eventually, since the supply of investors can-
not increase forever, and the perpetrator of the scheme no doubt
knows this. The perpetrator may hope to exit, not having paid off

the last and largest round of investors, and then hide from the law.
(Or, possibly, he or she may imagine that with luck, fantastic invest-
ment opportunities will be found later, thereby saving the scheme.)
We know that Ponzi schemes have been successful in making
their perpetrators rich, at least until they were apprehended. Charles
Ponzi attracted 30,000 investors in 1920 and issued notes totaling
$15,000,000, all within seven months.24In a recent celebrated story,
a former housewife, Raejean Bonham, set up an enormous Ponzi
scheme on her own in the tiny town of Fox in ruralAlaska. She
promised to pay 50% returns in two months and enticed 1,200
investors in forty-two states to pay her a total of between $10
and $15 million between 1989 and 1995.25
Aparticularly dramatic story emerged in Albania in 1996 and
1997 when a number of Ponzi schemes promising fantastic rates
of return enticed a good share of the people of that country.
Seven Ponzi schemes accumulated some $2 billion, or 30% of
Albania’s annual gross domestic product.26 Enthusiasm for the
schemes was so intense that in the 1996 local elections members
of the ruling government party included symbols of the Ponzi
scheme funds on their campaign posters, apparently wanting to
gain some credit for the new wealth sources. When the schemes
failed in 1997, enraged protesters looted banks and burned build-
ings, and the government was forced to call out the army to
restore peace; a number of rioters were killed. The collapse of the
schemes forced the resignation of Prime Minister Aleksander
Meksi and his cabinet.27
As part of their strategy, successful Ponzi schemes present to
investors a plausible story about how great profits can be made.
Charles Ponzi told investors that he was able to make money for
them by exploiting an arbitrage profit opportunity involving inter-
national postage reply coupons. These coupons were sold by postal
services so that the purchaser could enclose the coupon in a letter
to another country and thereby prepay a reply. There were appar-
ently some genuine potential profit opportunities in buying postage
reply coupons in Europe and selling them in the United States,
because the currency exchange rate did not correspond exactly to

                     PAGE 89                      
==================================================

66 STRUCTURAL FACTORS
the rate implicit in the coupons. Ponzi’s story of profit opportuni-
ties from trading the coupons, eventually published in newspapers
during the scheme, sounded plausible to some influential people.
But the actual profit opportunities were not realizable since there
was no easy way to sell the coupons, and the hoax began to
unravel when the New York postmaster declared that the world’s
supply of international postage reply coupons was not enough to
make the fortune Ponzi claimed to have made.
Raejean Bonham in Alaska claimed she was buying unused
frequent-flier miles from large companies, repackaging them as dis-
count tickets, and then selling them at a large profit. The Albanian
investment company VEFAwas supposedly making a number of
conventional investments in a reviving economy. (There was also
a rumor in Albania at the time that VEFAwas a front for money-
laundering, an activity that also sounded like a plausible source
of big money to many investors.)28
Acritical observation to be made about these examples of Ponzi
schemes is that initial investors were reportedly very skeptical about
the schemes and would invest only small amounts. Astory about
an arbitrage profit opportunity in postage reply coupons, if merely
told directly, without the evidence that it had made others a lot of
money, would not sound credible enough to entice many investors.
Investors do not become truly confident in the scheme until they
see others achieving large returns.
The possibility that the so-called investment payoffs are in fact
coming only from new money is typically raised repeatedly and pub-
licly well before the collapse of these schemes, and the hoaxers must
of course deny the claim publicly. This was the case both for the orig-
inal Ponzi scheme and for the Albanian example. The fact that
many people continue to believe in the scheme afterward seems puz-
zling, and to outside observers the believers in the scheme may seem
quite foolish.29But this only shows the powerful effect on people’s
thinking of seeing others having made substantial sums of money.
That others have made a lot of money appears to many people as
the most persuasive evidence in support of the investment story asso-
ciated with the Ponzi scheme—evidence that outweighs even the
most carefully reasoned argument against the story.

Speculative Bubbles as Naturally Occurring Ponzi Processes
It would appear, by extrapolation from examples like those given
in the previous section, that speculative feedback loops that are
in effect naturally occurring Ponzi schemes do arise from time to
time without the contrivance of a fraudulent manager. Even if there
is no manipulator fabricating false stories and deliberately deceiv-
ing investors in the aggregate stock market, tales about the market
are everywhere. When prices go up a number of times, investors
are rewarded sequentially by price movements in these markets,
just as they are in Ponzi schemes. There are still many people
(indeed, the stock brokerage and mutual fund industries as a
whole) who benefit from telling stories that suggest that the mar-
ket will go up further. There is no reason for these stories to be fraud-
ulent; they need only emphasize the positive news and give less
emphasis to the negative. The path of a naturally occurring Ponzi
scheme—if we may call speculative bubbles that—will be more irreg-
ular and less dramatic, since there is no direct manipulation, but
the path may sometimes resemble that of a Ponzi scheme when it
is supported by naturally occurring stories. The extension from Ponzi
schemes to naturally occurring speculative bubbles appears so
natural that one must conclude, if there is to be debate about spec-
ulative bubbles, that the burden of proof is on skeptics to provide
evidence as to why Ponzi-like speculative bubbles cannotoccur.
Many of the major finance textbooks today, which promote a view
of financial markets as working rationally and efficiently, do not
provide arguments as to why feedback loops supporting specu-
lative bubbles cannot occur. In fact, they do not even mention
bubbles or Ponzi schemes.30These books convey a sense of orderly
progression in financial markets, of markets that work with mathe-
matical precision. If the phenomena are not mentioned at all today,
then students are not given any way to judge for themselves
whether or not they are in fact influencing the market.

to the market create a desire to get into the game. Such is irrational
exuberance today in the United States.
There are many ultimate causes for this exuberance, as detailed
in the previous chapter, and the effects of these causes can be
amplified by a feedback loop, a speculative bubble, as we have seen
in this chapter.As prices continue to rise, the level of exuberance
is enhanced by the price rise itself.
In this chapter we have only begun to describe the process of
feedback. We have seen that feedback does not merely come about
as individuals look at past price increases and make arithmetical
calculations to adjust for individual levels of confidence and
expectations. The changes in thought patterns infect the entire cul-
ture, and they operate not only directly from past price increases but
also from auxiliary cultural changes that the past price increases
helped generate. For a better understanding of how precipitating
factors exert their effects and how they are amplified, we turn, in
the next part, to a broader discussion of the cultural changes that
accompanied the recent stock market boom and other speculative
booms.

Four
The News Media
The history of speculative bubbles
begins roughly with the advent
of newspapers.1One can assume that, although the record of these
early newspapers is mostly lost, they regularly reported on the first
bubble of any consequence, the Dutch tulip mania of the 1630s.2
Although the news media—newspapers, magazines, and broad-
castmedia, along with their new outlets on the Internet—present
themselves as detached observers of market events, they are them-
selves an integral part of these events. Significant market events
generally occur only if there is similar thinking among large
groups of people, and the news media are essential vehicles for the
spread of ideas.
In this chapter, I consider the complexity of the media’s impact
on market events. As we shall see, news stories rarely have a
simple, predictable effect on the market. Indeed, in some respects,
they have less impact than is commonly believed. However, a
careful analysis reveals that the news media do play an important
role both in setting the stage for market moves and in instigating
the moves themselves.

==================================================

72 CULTURAL FACTORS
The Role of the Media in Setting
the Stage for Market Moves
The news media are in constant competition to capture the public
attention they need to survive. Survival for them requires finding
and defining interesting news, focusing attention on news that has
word-of-mouth potential (so as to broaden their audience), and,
whenever possible, defining an ongoing story that encourages their
audience to remain steady customers.
The competition is by no means haphazard. Those charged with
disseminating the news cultivate a creative process, learning from
each others’ successes and failures, that aims to provide emotional
color to news, to invest news stories with human interest appeal,
and to create familiar figures in the news. Years of experience in
a competitive environment has made the media professions quite
skillful at claiming public attention.
The news media are naturally attracted to financial markets
because, at the very least, the markets provide constant news in
the form of daily price changes. Certainly other markets, such as
real estate, are sources of news. But real estate does not typically
generate daily price movements. Nothing beats the stock market
for sheer frequency of potentially interesting news items.
The stock market also has star quality. The public considers it
the Big Casino, the market for major players, and believes that on
any given day it serves as a barometer of the status of the nation—
all impressions that the media can foster and benefit from. Finan-
cial news may have great human interest potential to the extent that
it deals with the making or breaking of fortunes. And the financial
media can present their perennial lead, the market’s performance,
as an ongoing story—one that brings in the most loyal repeat cus-
tomers. The only other regular generator of news on a compara-
ble scale is sporting events. It is no accident that financial news and
sports news together account for roughly half of the editorial con-
tent of many newspapers today.
Media Cultivation of Debate
In an attempt to attract audiences, the news media try to present
debate about issues on the public mind. This may mean creating

                     PAGE 96                      
==================================================

THE NEWS MEDIA 73
a debate on topics that experts would not otherwise consider
deserving of such discussion. The resulting media event may con-
vey the impression that there are experts on all sides of the issue,
thereby suggesting a lack of expert agreement on the very issues
that people are most confused about.
I have over the years been called by newspeople asking me if I
would be willing to make a statement in support of some extreme
view. When I declined, the next request would inevitably be to rec-
ommend another expert who wouldgo on record in support of the
position.
Five days before the 1987 stock market crash, the MacNeil/Lehrer
NewsHour featured Ravi Batra, author of The Great Depression of
1990: Why It’s Got to Happen, How to Protect Yourself.This book took
as its basic premise a theory that history tends to repeat itself in
exact detail, so that the 1929 crash and subsequent depression had
to repeat themselves. Despite Batra’s significant scholarly reputation,
this particular book of his is not one that would be viewed with
any seriousness by most reputable scholars of the market. But it
had been on the New York Timesbest-seller list for fifteen weeks by
the time of the crash. On the NewsHour, Batra confidently pre-
dicted a stock market crash in 1989 that would “spread to the
wholeworld”; after it, he declared, “there will be a depression.”3
Batra’s statements, made as they were on a highly respected show,
may—eventhough they predicted a crash two years hence—have
contributedin some small measure to an atmosphere of vulner-
ability that brought us the crash of 1987. Although Batra’s appear-
ance on the NewsHour just before the crash might be considered
a coincidence, one must keep in mind that predictions of stock mar-
ket crashes are actually quite rare on national news shows. The prox-
imity of his appearance to the actual crash is at the very least highly
suggestive.
Should the media be faulted for presenting debates on topics
of little merit? One can argue that they ought to focus on a vari-
ety of topics of interest to general audiences, so that the public can
refine their views. Yet in doing so the media seem often to dis-
seminate and reinforce ideas that are not supported by real evidence.
If news directors followed only their highest intellectual interests
in judging which views to present, the public might indeed find

74 CULTURAL FACTORS
its consciousness constructively broadened. But that is appar-
ently not how the media see their mission—nor do competitive pres-
sures encourage them to rethink the matter.
Reporting on the Market Outlook
There is no shortage of media accounts that try to answer our ques-
tions about the market today, but thereisa shortage within these
accounts of relevant facts or considered interpretations of them. Many
news stories in fact seem to have been written under a deadline
to produce something—anything—to go along with the numbers
from the market. The typical such story, after noting the remark-
able bull market, focuses on very short-run statistics. It generally
states which groups of stocks have risen more than others in
recent months. Although these stocks are described as leaders, there
is no good reason to think that their performance has caused the
bull market. The news story may talk about the “usual” factors
behind economic growth, such as the Internet boom, in glowing
terms and with at least a hint of patriotic congratulation to our pow-
erful economic engine. The article then finishes with quotes from
a few well-chosen “celebrity” sources, offering their outlook for the
future. Sometimes the article is so completely devoid of genuine
thought about the reasons for the bull market and the context for
considering its outlook that it is hard to believe that the writer was
other than cynical in his or her approach.
What are the celebrity sources quoted as saying in these articles?
They typically give numerical forecasts for the Dow Jones Industrial
Average in the near future, tell stories or jokes, and dispense their
personal opinions. For example, when Abby Joseph Cohen of
Goldman Sachs & Co. coins a quotable phrase—as with her warn-
ings against “FUDD” (fear, uncertainty, doubt, and despair) or her
phrase “Silly Putty Economy”—it is disseminated widely. Beyond
that, the media quote her opinions but pay no critical attention
to her analysis. In fact, although she no doubt has access to a for-
midable research department and performs extensive data analy-
sis before forming her opinions, they are ultimately reported as just
that—her opinions. Of course she should not be faulted for this, for

it is the nature of the sound-bite-driven media that superficial opin-
ions arepreferred to in-depth analyses.
Record Overload
The media often seem to thrive on superlatives, and we, their
audience, are confused as to whether the price increases we have
recently seen in the stock market are all that unusual. Data that sug-
gest that we are setting some new record (or are at least close to
doing so) are regularly stressed in the media , and if reporters look
at the data in enough different ways, they will often findsomething
that is close to setting a record on any given day. In covering the
stock market, many writers mention “record one-day price
changes”—measured in points on the Dow rather than percentage
terms, so that records are much more likely.Although the media
have become increasingly enlightened about reporting in terms of
points on the Dow in recent years, the practice still persists among
some writers.
This record overload—the impression that new and significant
records are constantly being set—only adds to the confusion people
have about the economy. It makes it hard for people to recognize
when something truly and importantly new reallyishappening. It
also, with its deluge of different indicators, encourages an avoidance
of individual assessment of quantitative data—a preference for
seeing the data interpreted for us by celebrity sources.
Do Big Stock Price Changes Really Follow Big News Days?
Many people seem to think that it is the reporting of specific news
events, the serious content of news, that affects financial markets.
But research offers far less support for this view than one would
imagine.
Victor Niederhoffer, while he was still an assistant professor
atBerkeley in 1971 (before he became a legendary hedge fund man-
ager), published an article that sought to establish whether days
with news of significant world events corresponded to days
thatsaw big stock price movements. He tabulated all very large



==================================================
                     PAGE 99                      
==================================================

76 CULTURAL FACTORS
headlines in the New York Times(large type size being taken as a
crude indicator of relative importance) from 1950 to 1966; there were
432 such headlines. Did these significant-world-event days cor-
respond to big movements in stock prices? As the standard of com-
parison, Niederhoffer noted that the S&PComposite Index over
this period showed substantial one-day increases (of more than
0.78%) on only 10% of the trading days, and substantial one-day
decreases (of more than 0.71%) on only another 10% of the trading
days. Of the 432 significant-world-event days, 78 (or 18%) showed
bigprice increases, and 56 (or 13%) showed big decreases. Thus such
days were only slightly more likely to show large price movements
than other days.4
Niederhoffer claimed that, on reading the stories under these
headlines, many of the world events reported did not seem likely
to have much impact on the fundamental value represented by
thestock market. Perhaps what the media thoughtwas big national
news was not what was really important to the stock market. He
speculated that news events that represented crises were more likely
to influence the stock market.
Defining a crisis as a time when five or more large headlines
occurred within a seven-day period, Niederhoffer found eleven
crises in the sample interval. These were the beginning of the
Korean war in 1950, the capture of Seoul by the Communists in 1951,
the Democratic National Convention of 1952, Russian troops’
threatening Hungary and Poland in 1956, the Suez crisis of 1956,
Charles de Gaulle’s taking office as French premier in 1958, the entry
of U.S. marines into Lebanon in 1958, Russian premier Nikita
Khrushchev’s appearance at the United Nations in 1959, Cuban ten-
sions in 1960, the Cuban arms blockade in 1962, and President John
Kennedy’s assassination in 1963. During these crises, so defined,
42% of the daily price changes were “big” changes, as compared
with 20% for other, “normal” time periods. Thus the crisis periods
were somewhat, but not dramatically, more likely to be accom-
paniedby big stock price changes.
Note that there were only eleven such weeks of “crisis” in the
whole sixteen years of Niederhoffer’s sample. Very few of the

aggregate price movements in the stock market show any meaning-
ful association with headlines.
Tag-Along News
News stories occurring on days of big price swings that are cited
as the causes of the changes often cannot, one suspects, plausibly
account for the changes—or at least not for their full magnitude.
On Friday, October 13, 1989, there was a stock market crash that
was clearly identified by the media as a reaction to a news story.
Aleveraged buyout deal for UALCorporation, the parent company
of United Airlines, had fallen through. The crash, which resulted
in a 6.91% drop in the Dow for the day, had begun just minutes after
this announcement, and so it at first seemed highly likely that it
was the cause of the crash.
The first problem with this interpretation is that UALis just one
firm, accounting for but a fraction of 1% of the stock market’s total
value. Why should the collapse of the UALbuyout have such an
impact on the entire market? One interpretation at the time was
that the deal’s failure was viewed by the market as a watershed
event, portending that many other similar pending buyouts would
also fail. But no concrete arguments were given in support of this
view; rather, dubbing it a watershed seemed to have been nothing
more than an effort to make sense after the fact of the market’s move
in response to the news.
To try to discover the reasons for the October 13, 1989, crash,
survey researcher William Feltus and I carried out a telephone sur-
vey of 101 market professionals on the Monday and Tuesday fol-
lowing the crash. We asked: “Did you hear about the UALnews
before you heard about the market drop on Friday afternoon, or
did you hear about the UALnews later as an explanation for the
drop in the stock market?” Only 36% said they had heard about
the news before the crash; 53% said they had heard about it after-
ward as an explanation for the drop; the rest were unsure when
they had heard about it. Thus it appears that the news story may
havetagged alongafter the crash, rather than directly caused it, and

therefore that it was not as prominent as the media accounts
suggested.
We also asked the market professionals to interpret the news
story. We queried:
Which of the following two statements better represents the view
you held last Friday:
1. The UAL news of Friday afternoon will reduce future
takeovers, and so the UALnews is a sensible reason for the
sudden drop in stock prices.
2. The UALnews of Friday afternoon should be viewed as a focal
point or attention grabber, which prompted investors to
express their doubts about the market.
Of the respondents, 30% chose 1 and 50% chose 2; the rest were
unsure. Thus they were mostly reacting to the news as an inter-
pretation of the behavior of investors.5It may be correct to say that the
news event was fundamentalto this stock market crash, in that it
represented a “story” that enhanced the feedback from stock price
drops to further stock price drops, thereby preserving the feedback
effect for a longer period than would otherwise have been the case.
Yet it was unlikely to have been its cause.
The Absence of News on Days of Big Price Changes
We can also look at days of unusually large price movements and
ask if there were exceptionally important items of news on those
days. Following up on Niederhoffer’s work, in 1989 David Cut-
ler, James Poterba, and Lawrence Summers compiled a list of the
fifty largest U.S. stock market movements, as measured by the S&P
Index, since World War II, and for each tabulated the explanations
offeredin the news media. Most of the so-called explanations do
not correspond to any unusual news, and some of them could not
possibly be considered serious news. For example, the reasons given
for large price movements included such relatively innocuous state-
ments as “Eisenhower urges confidence in the economy,” “further
reaction to Truman victory over Dewey,” and “replacement buy-
ing after earlier fall.”6

THE NEWS MEDIA 79
Some would argue that perhaps we should not expect to see
prominent news on days of big price changes, even if markets are
working perfectly. Price changes in a so-called efficient market occur,
so the argument goes, as soon as the information becomes public;
they do not wait until the information is reported in the media. (This
is a topic to which I return in Chapter 9.) Thus it is not surprising,
according to this line of reasoning, that we often do not find new
information in the newspaper on the day of a price change: earlier
information, appearing to the casual observer as tangential or irrel-
evant, has already been interpreted by perceptive investors as sig-
nificant to the fundamentals that should determine share prices.
Another argument advanced to explain why days of unusually
large stock price movements have often not been found to coin-
cide with important news is that a confluence of factors may cause
a significant market change, even if the individual factors them-
selves are not particularly newsworthy. For example, suppose cer-
tain investors are informally using a particular statistical model that
forecasts fundamental value using a number of economic indica-
tors. If all or most of these particular indicators point the same way
on a given day, even if no single one of them is of any substantive
importance by itself, their combined effect will be noteworthy.
Both of these interpretations of the tenuous relationship between
news and market movements assume that the public is paying con-
tinuous attention to the news—reacting sensitively to the slight-
est clues about market fundamentals, constantly and carefully
adding up all the disparate pieces of evidence. But that is just not
the way public attention works. Our attention is much more
quixotic and capricious. Instead, news functions more often as an
initiatorof a chain of events that fundamentally change the pub-
lic’s thinking about the market.
News as the Precipitator of Attention Cascades
The role of news events in affecting the market seems often to be
delayed, and to have the effect of setting in motion a sequence of pub-
lic attentions.These attentions may be to images or stories, or to facts
that may already have been well known. The facts may previously

have been ignored or judged inconsequential, but they can attain
newfound prominence in the wake of breaking news. These
sequences of attention may be called cascades,as one focus of atten-
tion leads to attention to another, and then another.
At 5:46 A.M. on Tuesday, January 17, 1995, an earthquake measuring
7.2 on the Richter scale struck Kobe, Japan; it was the worst earth-
quake to hit urban Japan since 1923. The reaction of the stock mar-
kets of the world to this event provides an interesting case study
since in this case we know without doubt that the precipitating
event, the earthquake, was truly exogenous and not itself generated
by human activity or business conditions—not a response to a subtle
hint of economic change nor the result of a confluence of unusual
values of conventional economic indicators. In the Cutler-Poterba-
Summers list of media explanations for the fifty largest postwar
movements in the S&PIndex in the United States, discussed earlier,
not a single one of the explanations referred to any substantial cause
that was definitely exogenous to the economy.7
The earthquake took 6,425 lives. According to estimates by the
Center for Industrial Renovation of Kansai, the total damage
caused by the earthquake was about $100 billion. The reaction in
financial markets was strong, but delayed. The Tokyo stock mar-
ket fell only slightly that day, and prices of construction-related
companies generally rose, reflecting the expected increased demand
for their products and services. Analysts reported at that time that
the probable effects of the earthquake on corporate value were as
yet ambiguous, since the wave of rebuilding after the quake might
stimulate the Japanese economy.
The biggest reaction to the earthquake did not come until a week
later. On January 23, the Japanese Nikkei index fell 5.6% on no
apparent news except the gradual unfolding of numerous news
accounts of earthquake damage. Over the ten days following the
earthquake, the Nikkei lost over 8% of its value. If viewed as the
direct result of the earthquake damage alone, the loss of value would
be an overreaction.
What was going on in investors’ minds over the ten days fol-
lowing the earthquake? Of course, there is no rigorous way to find
out. We know only that over this period the Kobe earthquake dom-

inated the news, created new and different images of Japan, and
may have led to very different impressions about the Japanese econ-
omy. Moreover, the quake sparked discussions about the risk of
an earthquake centered in Tokyo. Despite the fact that geological
evidence suggesting that Tokyo is at risk for a major earthquake
was already known, greater attention was now focused on this
potential problem. The damage that an earthquake of the sever-
ity of the 1923 quake could cause to modern-day Tokyo was put
at $1.25 trillion by Tokai Research and Consulting Inc.8
Even more puzzling than the direct effect of the Kobe earthquake
on the domestic Japanese markets was its effect on foreign stock
markets. On the day that the Nikkei fell 5.6%, the FT-SE 100 index
in London fell 1.4%, the CAC-40 in Paris fell 2.2%, and the DAX
in Germany fell 1.4%. The Brazilian and Argentine stock markets
both fell about 3%. These diverse countries around the world suf-
fered no earthquake damage on this occasion.
The best interpretation of the effects of the Kobe earthquake on
the stock markets of the world is that news coverage of the earth-
quake, and of the accompanying stock market declines, engaged
the attention of investors, prompting a cascade of attentions that
brought to the fore some more pessimistic factors.
Another market reaction to news illustrates how media attention
may, through a cascade of attentions, lead many investors to even-
tually take seriously news that would normally be considered
nonsense and irrelevant.Asequence of news stories about Joseph
Granville, a flamboyant market forecaster, appear to have caused
a couple of major market moves. The only substantive content of
these media stories was that Granville was telling his clients to buy
or sell, and that Granville himself was influential.
Granville’s behavior easily attracted public attention. His invest-
ment seminars were bizarre extravaganzas, sometimes featuring
a trained chimpanzee who could play Granville’s theme song, “The
Bagholder’s Blues,” on a piano. He once showed up at an invest-
ment seminar dressed as Moses, wearing a crown and carrying
tablets. Granville made extravagant claims for his forecasting
ability. He said he could forecast earthquakes and once claimed to
have predicted six of the past seven major world quakes. He was

quoted by Timemagazine as saying, “I don’t think that I will ever
make a serious mistake in the stock market for the rest of my life,”
and he predicted that he would win the Nobel Prize in economics.9
The first Granville episode took place on Tuesday, April 22,
1980. With the news that he had changed his recommendation from
short to long, the Dow rose 30.72 points, or 4.05%. This was the
biggest increase in the Dow since November 1, 1978, a year and a
half earlier. The second episode occurred on January 6, 1981, after
Granville’s investor service changed from a long recommendation
to a short recommendation. The Dow took its biggest dive since
October 9, 1979, over a year earlier. There was no other news on
either of these occasions that might appear responsible for the
market change, and on the second occasion both the Wall Street
Journal and Barrons squarely attributed the drop to Granville’s
recommendation.
Can we be sure that media reporting of Granville and his sup-
posed powers of prognostication caused these changes? Many
people wondered if the Granville effect was not just a coincidence
that the news media exaggerated. Wecanbe sure that a sequence
of news stories about Granville’s pronouncements, with their
substantial word-of-mouth potential, had a cumulative effect on
national attention, and that public reactions to his pronouncements
and to market declines at the time of his announcements were fun-
damentally altered by this cascade.10
News during the Crash of 1929
The role of the news media in causing the stock market crash of
1929 has been debated almost since the crash itself. In fact the puzzle
facing historians and economists has been, by some interpretations,
that just before the crash there was no significant news at all. But,
people have wondered ever since, how could this record stock mar-
ket crash get under way with no news? What common concerns
were on the minds of sellers that caused so many of them to try to
sell at the same time?
The Monday, October 28, 1929, stock market crash was the big-
gest single-day drop (measured between the closing price the

previous trading day and the closing price on the day) in the
Dow until the October 19, 1987, crash. On October 28, 1929, the Dow
fell 12.8% in one day (13.01% measured from the high to the low
on that day). The second-biggest drop in history (until 1987)
occurred the following day, when the Dow dropped 11.7% (15.9%
measured from the highto the low on that day). The combined close-
to-close drop in those two days in 1929 was 23.1%. What news had
arisen that might rationally account for such a sizable stock market
decline?
On reading the major newspapers over that weekend and on
into the morning of Tuesday, October 29, one is easily led to con-
clude that nothing of any consequence for the fundamentals of
the market was happening. Indeed that was the conclusion
reported in the newspapers themselves. On the morning of Octo-
ber 29, newspapers around the country carried an Associated Press
story that said in part, “In the absence of any adverse news
developments over the week-end, and in the face of the optimistic
comments on business forthcoming from President Hoover and
leading industrial and banking executives, Wall Street’s only
explanation of today’s decline was that a careful checking up of
accounts over the week-end disclosed numerous weak spots,
which had been overlooked in the hectic sessions of last week.”
TheNew York Timesattributed the drop only to a “general loss of
confidence.” The Wall Street Journalreported that “business in gen-
eral shows no signs of disintegration” and that the decline was
due to “necessitous liquidation of impaired accounts.”11
What else was in the news on those days? As of Monday morn-
ing there was news that the Interstate Commerce Commission
would proceed with its plan to recapture some excess railroad
income. There was a favorable report on the earnings of U.S. Steel.
New information was reported on charges that the Connecticut
Manufacturer’sAssociation had succeeded in introducing into a
tariff bill provisions favoring Connecticut. Mussolini had made a
speech saying that the “men and institutions of fascism can face
any crisis, even if it is sudden.” Anew aspirant to the French pre-
miership, Edouard Daladier, announced the foreign minister of his
prospective cabinet. ABritish airliner was lost at sea with seven

aboard. The Graf Zeppelin planned a trip to explore the Arctic.
Richard Byrd’s party was making progress toward the South Pole.
After Black Monday, early on Tuesday morning, the second day
of the crash, it was reported that prominent financiers had asserted
that heavy banking support would come into the market that
day, in search of bargains. If this was significant news at all, one
would think it was good news. Other news on Tuesday morning
was that two senators had called on President Hoover to declare
his position on duties on agricultural and industrial products, that
Senator Hiram Bingham had complained that the Lobby Inquiry
had treated him unfairly, a Hungarian count and countess had been
given the right to enter the country, and another airliner had been
lost with five aboard.
All of these stories sound very typical. If there really was a good
reason for the drop in the market, then certainly there must have
beensomethinghappening at the time that people knew about. And
one would think that such concerns would have made it into the
news in some form. Perhaps one must read the papers more care-
fully. One author, Jude Wanniski, indeed claimed that there was
a story in the New York Timeson the morning of Monday, October
28, 1929, that might conceivably account for such a decline. This
front-page story was an optimistic report on the likelihood of pas-
sage of the Smoot-Hawley tariff, then still in committee. The story
was picked up by the Associated Press and United News the fol-
lowing day and given front-page treatment around the country on
Tuesday, October 29.12
It is conceivable that the Smoot-Hawley tariff might have been
expected to hurt the outlook for U.S. corporate profits. One could
have thought that it would generally benefit corporations, many
of whom actively sought the tariff. But it has been argued by his-
torians of the 1929 crash that the tariff might have been expected
to have the opposite effect, given the retaliation from other countries
that it would engender.Allan Meltzer in fact argued that the tariff
could be the reason “why the 1929 recession did not follow the path
of previous monetary contractions but became the Great Depres-
sion.”13 However, other economists, including Rudiger Dorn-
busch and Stanley Fischer, pointed out that exports were only 7%

of the gross national product (GNP) in 1929 and that between
1929 and 1931 they fell by only 1.5% of 1929 GNP. This hardly seems
like the cause of the Great Depression. Moreover, they pointed out
that it is not clear that the Smoot-Hawley tariff was responsible for
the decline in exports. The depression itself might be held respon-
sible for part of the decline. Dornbusch and Fischer showed that
the 1922 Fordney-McCumber tariff increased tariff rates as much
as the Smoot-Hawley tariff, and the Fordney-McCumber tariff
was of course followed by no such recession.14
Even if we were to allow that the possibility of passage of the
Smoot-Hawley tariff was important enough to account for a
decline in share values of this magnitude, one must still ask
whether there was any news over the weekend that would sub-
stantially alter one’s estimation of the likelihood that the tariff would
be passed. Just what was the content of the story in the New York
Times? On Saturday, October 26, Senator David Reed declared
that the Smoot-Hawley tariff bill was “dead” in committee. This
provoked denials by Senators Reed Smoot and William Borah. The
Timesquoted Senator Smoot as saying, “If that is Senator Reed’s
opinion, I suppose he has a right to express it. But it isn’t the view
of the Finance Committee.” Senator Borah said, “My opinion is that
the tariff bill is not going to die.” The next morning, October 29,
theTimesreported that Senator Reed had reiterated his conviction
that the bill was dead and went on to cite other opinions on both
sides of the issue. Although the original Timesstory had sounded
optimistic for the bill, the United News version of the story pub-
lished on October 29 was pessimistic. The Atlanta Constitution,when
it ran the story on October 29, carried the headline, “Senate Gives
Up Hope of Enacting New Tariff Bill.”
Nonetheless, it is hard to see that this interchange among sen-
ators, so typical of political wrangling, amounts to important news.
The same sort of news accounts had been coming out all along with
regard to the tariff bill. Aweek earlier, on October 21, the Timeshad
quoted Senator James Watson, Republican leader of the Senate,
offering his view that the Senate would pass the bill within another
month. On October 13, Senator Smoot was reported as telling
President Hoover that there was a chance the bill would pass by

November 20. Alternately optimistic and pessimistic news on the
tariff bill had been coming in since Hoover’s election.
Far more significant than news about fundamentals among the
newspaper stories on Monday, October 28, 1929, are clues to the
importance attached in people’s minds to the events of just a few
days earlier, when the stock exchange had seen a record decline
in share prices. That was the so-called Black Thursday, October 24,
1929, when the Dow had fallen 12.9% within the day but recov-
ered substantially before the end of trading, so that the closing aver-
age was down only 2.1% from the preceding close. This event was
no longer news, but the memory of the emotions it had generated
was very much part of the ambience on Monday. The New York
Times noted in its Monday morning edition that Wall Street,
“normally deserted and quiet on Sunday as a country graveyard,
hummed with activity as bankers and brokers strove to put their
houses in order after the most strenuous week in history. . . .
When the bell clangs at 10 o’clock this morning for the resumption
of trading, most houses will be abreast of their work and ready for
what may come.” The atmosphere of that Sunday on Wall Street
was described: “Sightseers strolled from street to street, gazing curi-
ously at the Stock Exchange Building and the Morgan banking
offices across the way, centers of last week’s dramatic financial hap-
penings. Here and there a sightseer picked up from the street a
vagrant slip of ticker tape, as visitors seize upon spent bullets on
a battlefield as souvenirs. Sightseeing buses made special trips
through the district.”15
Indeed, on that same Monday morning of the crash the Wall Street
Journalsaw fit to run a front-page editorial stating that “everybody
in responsible positions says that business conditions are sound.”16
The editorial staff of the Journalmust have had reasons to suspect
that reassurance was needed if the market was to remain stable.
Presumably they had heard snippets of popular conversation, or
could at least guess how people might react following the week-
end, given the huge debacle on Thursday.
So perhaps what happened on Monday, October 28, 1929, was
just an echo, albeit a very exaggerated one, of what had happened
the previous week. What had the media said about this? Again, the

newspapers seemed to think that there was no important news. The
Chicago Tribune wrote, on Sunday, October 27, 1929, “It has been
the collapse of a vastly inflated bubble of speculation, with little or
no cause in the country’s general situation. Atop-heavy structure
has collapsed of its own weight—there has been no earthquake.”
TheNew York Timessaid, “The market smash has been caused by
technical rather than fundamental considerations.” The Guaranty
Survey,published by the Guaranty Trust Company, remarked that
“to suppose that the selling wave of the last few weeks was due
to adverse developments of corresponding importance in the gen-
eral business situation would be a fundamental error.”17
Let us go back in time and look at the news on the morning of
Black Thursday, October 24, 1929. Once again, the news does not
seem to be very significant. President Hoover had announced a plan
to develop inland waterways. Atlantic Refinings’ earnings for the
year were reported to be its highest ever. The president of a sugar
company had told a Senate committee investigating lobbying that
$75,000 had been spent by the sugar lobby since December in a cam-
paign to reduce duties on sugar. Negotiators had reported a set-
back in efforts to establish the Bank for International Settlements.
ACarnegie Fund report decried the subsidization of college ath-
letes. The America’s Cup committee had announced the rules for
the next running of the yacht race. An amateur pilot attempting
a solo flight across the Atlantic was reported lost. President Hoover
had taken a trip on a picturesque river boat down the Ohio River.
Nothing here seems remotely to suggest anything fundamen-
tal about the outlook for the stock market. But let us look back yet
another day. There was news on the Wednesday before Black
Thursday that there had been a major drop in the market (the Dow
closed on Wednesday down 6.3% from Tuesday’s close) and that
total transactions had had their second highest day in history.
Should we then look for the cause in the news of October 23, 1929?
Again there was no national news of any apparent significance, but
again there were references to past market moves. The most sig-
nificant concrete news stories in the newspapers seem consistently
to have been about previous moves of the market itself. The most
prominent content in the news appears to have been interpretations

of the reasons for these previous moves, often in terms of investor
psychology.
There is no way that the events of the stock market crash of 1929
can be considered a response to any real news stories. We see
instead a negative bubble,operating through feedback effects of price
changes, and an attention cascade,with a series of heightened pub-
lic fixations on the market. This sequence of events appears to be
fundamentally no different from those of other market debacles—
including the notorious crash of 1987, to which we now turn.
News during the Crash of 1987
When the stock market crashed on October 19, 1987—setting a new
record one-day decline that nearly doubled that of either October
28 or October 29, 1929 (to this day it is the all-time record one-day
price drop)—I considered it a unique opportunity to inquire
directly of investors what they considered to be the significant news
on that day. It was no longer necessary, as it had been for those who
studied the 1929 crash, to rely on media interpretations suggest-
ing what was the important news on investors’ minds. As far as
I have been able to determine, no one else took advantage of this
opportunity. The results of my questionnaire survey, sent out to
a sample of institutional investors and a sample of individual
investors the week of the crash, were the only published findings
of a survey asking investors what they were thinking on the day
of the crash.18
In my 1987 survey, I listed all the news stories published in the
few days preceding the crash that seemed at all relevant to the chang-
ing opinions of the market, ending with news that had appeared
in the papers on the morning of the crash. I asked the investors:
Please tell us how important each of the following news items was
to you personally on October 19, 1987, in your evaluation of stock
market prospects. Please rate them on a one-to-seven scale, 1 indi-
cating that the term was completely unimportant, 4 indicating that
it was of moderate importance, 7 indicating that it was very impor-
tant. Please tell how important youthen felt these were, and not how
others thought about them.

==================================================

THE NEWS MEDIA 89
I included ten news stories, and in the eleventh position a space
marked “Other” where respondents could write in their own
choices.
The results were broadly similar between institutional and indi-
vidual investors, and between those who had actually bought or
sold on October 19. Respondents rated everything as relevant. They
thought that most of the news stories rated at least a 4, that is, they
were of moderate importance. The only news story that merited
an average score less than 3 was the sell signal that investment guru
Robert Prechter was reported to have given on October 14, and even
that received a score around 2. Even the news that the United States
had attacked an Iranian oil station, a minor skirmish reported on
October 19, received a rating over 3. Respondents were not very
forthcoming with other news stories in the “Other” category. They
tended to mention concerns, rather than news stories that broke
at the time of the crash. The most common write-in answer was
a concern about too much indebtedness, referring variously to the
federal deficit, the national debt, or taxes. Such a response was
offered by a third of the individual investors who wrote in answers
and a fifth of the institutional investors.
But the striking result was that the most highly rated news
stories among those I listed were those about past price declines them-
selves.The most important news story, according to the respondents,
was the 200-point drop in the Dow on the morning of October 19,
a news story that yielded an average score of 6.54 among individual
sellers on October 19 and 6.05 among institutional sellers on Octo-
ber 19. The preceding week’s news of the record (in terms of points
lost) stock market declines was considered the second most impor-
tant story.
One of the questions asked respondents to give their recollec-
tions of the interpretations they had attached to the price declines
on the day of the crash: “Can you remember any specific theory
you had about the causes for the price declines October 14–19,
1987?” Respondents were given space to write answers in their own
words, which I read and categorized. Odd as it may seem from the
perspective of today’s much higher market, the most common
theme in the answers to this open-ended question was that the

market had been overpriced before the crash. Overpricing was men-
tioned by 33.9% of the individual investors and 32.6% of the insti-
tutional investors. Although this response accounts for fewer than
half the answers, it is noteworthy that so many thought to men-
tion this in answer to an open-ended question. (I also asked them
directly elsewhere on the questionnaire whether they thought, just
before the crash, that the market was overpriced, and 71.7% of the
individual investors [91.0% of those who had sold on October 19]
and 84.3% of the institutional investors [88.5% of those who had
sold on October 19] said yes.)19Another important theme in answer
to the open-ended question was one of institutional stop-loss, iden-
tified by the presence of the wordsinstitutional selling, program trad-
ing, stop-loss, or computer trading; 22.8% of the individuals and
33.1% of the institutional investors mentioned such a theme. There
was also an investor irrationality theme, identified by statements
to the effect that investors were crazy or that the fall was due to
investor panic or capricious changes in opinion; 25.4% of the indi-
viduals and 24.4% of the institutional investors touched on this
theme. None of these major themes had anything to do with
breaking news events other than the crash itself.
Immediately after this question, I asked on the questionnaire,
“Which of the following better describes your theory about the
declines: a theory about investor psychology [or] a theory about
fundamentals such as profits or interest rates?” Most—67.5% of the
institutional investors and 64.0% of the individual investors—
picked a theory about investor psychology.
Thus it appears that the stock market crash had substantially to
do with a psychological feedback loop among the general investing
public from price declines to selling and thus further price declines,
along the lines of a negative bubble, as discussed in Chapter 3. The
crash apparently had nothing particularly to do with any news story
other than that of the crash itself, but rather with theories about
other investors’ reasons for selling and about their psychology.
President Ronald Reagan, reacting to the crash, set up a study
commission headed by former Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.
He asked the Brady Commission to tell him what had caused the
crash and what should be done about it. Investment professionals

are generally uncomfortable going on record to explain the causes
of such events, and many reports about the crash tended to focus
the inquiry away from its ultimate causes. But the members of
the Brady Commission were under orders from the president of the
United States to face the matter head on. As a result, we have in
their report the only major effort to collect all the relevant facts and
explain the crash of 1987. They wrote in their summary the following
explanation for the crash:
The precipitous market decline of mid-October was “triggered” by
specific events: an unexpectedly high merchandise trade deficit
which pushed interest rates to new high levels, and proposed tax
legislation which led to the collapse of the stocks of a number of
takeover candidates. This initial decline ignited mechanical, price-
insensitive selling by a number of institutions employing portfolio
insurance strategies and a small number of mutual fund groups
reacting to redemptions. The selling by these investors, and the
prospect of further selling by them, encouraged a number of aggres-
sive trading-oriented institutions to sell in anticipation of further
market declines. These institutions included, in addition to hedge
funds, a small number of pension and endowment funds, money
management firms and investment banking houses. This selling, in
turn, stimulated further reactive selling by portfolio insurers and
mutual funds.20
This conclusion by the Brady Commission sounds in some ways
very much like the one I drew from my own survey-based study
of the crash. By “price-insensitive selling” they mean selling that
comes in response to a price drop but is insensitive to how low the
price goes before the sale is concluded—selling at any price. The
commission was saying here, most prominently, that the crash was
caused by what I have called a feedback loop, with initial price
declines influencing more investors to exit the market, thereby cre-
ating further price declines. The Brady Commission was saying,
in effect, that the crash of 1987 was a negative bubble.
Astrength of the Brady Commission’s study of the crash rela-
tive to my own was their unparalleled access to major investing
institutions. Their study complements my own in reaching the con-
clusion that a feedback loop was at work in the crash. However,
their conclusion sounds a bit different from mine in that it gives

prominence to the substantive content of news stories. In addition,
theirs suggests that much of the selling was “mechanical” or “reac-
tive,” rather than psychological or herdlike.
Based on the results of my study, the news stories that the Brady
Commission mentions about the merchandise trade deficit and
about new highs in interest rates cannot be considered central to
investors’ thinking. In my survey, I included these in my list of news
stories and got a lukewarm response from respondents (mostly 4s).
Moreover, if one looks at long-term plots of both the trade deficit
and interest rates, it is very clear that there was no sudden break
in either of these series that could possibly be seen as standing out
in a historical perspective. Virtually nothing happened to either the
trade deficit or interest rates.
The proposed tax legislation that the Brady Commission men-
tions had completely escaped my notice as an important news story
to include on my list. The news had broken on October 14, five days
before the crash, and it had not seemed to me to be the subject of
significant public comment in the days leading up to the crash. Rep-
resentative Dan Rostenkowski’s House Ways and Means Committee
was considering tax changes that would have had the effect of
discouraging corporate takeovers. Changing capital gains tax pro-
visions struck many would-be interpreters of the crash after the
fact as having fundamental importance for stock prices in an effi-
cient market.
When I learned of the potential importance of this news story,
I went back over the questionnaires I had received to see how many
respondents had mentioned it in their answers under “Other.” I
found no mention at all among the 605 individual responses, and
only three mentions among the 284 institutional responses. Clearly,
this news story does not deserve to be singled out as a major cause
of the crash.21
The Brady Commission puts quite a bit of stress on a tool of insti-
tutional investors called “portfolio insurance.” Portfolio insurance
is a strategy for limiting losses that was invented by Professors
Hayne Leland and Mark Rubinstein at the University of California
at Berkeley and successfully marketed by them to many institu-
tional investors in the 1980s. Portfolio insurance is really a mis-
nomer; the strategy is merely a plan for selling stocks. It involves

THE NEWS MEDIA 93
impressive mathematical models, but in fact it is nothing more than
a formalized procedure for getting out of the market by selling
stocks when they start to go down. Leland himself, in his classic
1980 article on portfolio insurance, admits as much: “Some ‘rules
of thumb’ such as ‘run with your winners, cut your losses’ and ‘sell
at a new high, buy at a new low,’ will be shown to approximate
the optimal dynamic trading strategies for certain types of
investors.”22So, by using portfolio insurance, investors are merely
doing what has always come naturally, only with a little more
mathematical precision and careful planning. But with the fancy
new name “portfolio insurance,” which suggests that the strategy
is prudent and sensible, and with its high-tech image, the advent
of this strategy quite likely made many investors more reactive to
past price changes.
The adoption of portfolio insurance by many institutional
investors was a sort of fad—a sophisticated fad, but a fad none-
theless. Since it has a distinctive name (the term portfolio insurance
had essentially not been used before 1980), it is possible to trace
the course of this investor fad by means of word counts in the press.
I performed such a count on ABI/INFORM, a database of business
periodicals, and found no more than 1 reference to portfolio insur-
ance in each of the years 1980–83, 4 in 1984, 6 in 1985, 41 in 1986,
and 75 in 1987. References to portfolio insurance were growing
along the type of steady growth path that characterizes simple
word-of-mouth epidemic models, which will be discussed in
Chapter 8.23
So the development of portfolio insurance changed the way some
investors reacted to past price changes just before the crash of 1987.
There were probably other changes in the nature of the feedback
loop that, because they were not so concretely programmed as port-
folio insurance, we could not observe directly. But the important
point is that it was the changed nature of the feedback loop, not the news
stories that broke around the time of the crash,that was the essential
cause of the crash.
Feedback can be modified by many factors, and the news media
themselves can certainly have an impact on it. The Wall Street
Journal,on the morning of the 1987 crash, ran a plot showing the
Dow in the 1980s and, just below it, a plot showing the Dow in the

1920s up to and for a month after the crash of 1929.24The two plots
were aligned so that the current date lined up with the date of the
1929 crash, and so the plot suggested that the crash of 1929 might
be about to repeat itself. Investors had the opportunity to see this
plot at breakfast a matter of minutes before the crash of 1987 actu-
ally started. The Journalwas openly suggesting the possibilityof a
crash starting that day. True, this was not a front-page story, and
no one story by itself is decisive in causing a crash. But this little
story and the accompanying plot, appearing as they did on the morn-
ingof the crash, probably did help prime investors to be more alert
to suggestions of a crash.
When the big price declines on the morning of October 19, 1987,
began, the archetype that was the 1929 crash encouraged many
people to question whether “it” was happening again—the “it”
being the Great Crash as illustrated in the Journal,not the crash of
1907, nor the upcrash of 1932, nor any of the numerous other his-
torical stock market events that by then had been almost completely
forgotten. The mental image of the biggest crash in history possibly
happening on that very day had the potential to enhance the feed-
back from initial price declines to later price declines. The image
also provided a suggestion of how far the market would decline
before it rebounded, a crucial factor in determining how far the
market actually did fall. In fact, in the crash of October 19, 1987,
the Dow actually fell in one day almost the same amount as it did
on October 28–29, 1929—22.6% in 1987 versus 23.1% in 1929. That
it fell roughly the same amount on both occasions might be regarded
as just a coincidence, especially since the 1987 crash took two
days rather than one, and few investors in 1987 even knew exactly
how far the market fell in 1929. On the other hand, many did have
a rough impression of the extent of the 1929 plunge, and there was
little other concrete information available to investors on October
19, 1987, to suggest when the market should stop falling.
The changed feedback that occurred at the time of the 1987 crash
should be thought of as just one example of continually changing
price-to-price feedback, as investors’ theories and methods change
over time. It would be a mistake to describe the changed feedback
as the result only of the technological innovation represented by
portfolio insurance. Despite the use of computers in executing port-

folio insurance strategies, it is still people who decide to deploy
the tool and who decide how quickly it will take effect in a declin-
ing market. And there are of course many other people who, aware
that portfolio insurance is being used, adjust their own informal
responses to past price changes depending on their perceptions of
other investors’ use of the strategy. Portfolio insurance is of inter-
est to us in this context only because it shows us concretely how
people’s thinking can change in ways that alter the manner in which
feedback from stock price changes affects further stock price
changes, thereby creating possible price instabilities.
The Role of News Media in Propagating Speculative Bubbles
The role of the news media in the stock market is not, as commonly
believed, simply as a convenient tool for investors who are react-
ing directly to the economically significant news itself. The media
actively shape public attention and categories of thought, and
they create the environment within which the stock market events
we see are played out.
The examples given in this chapter illustrate that the news
media are fundamental propagators of speculative price movements
through their efforts to make news interesting to their audience.
They sometimes strive to enhance such interest by attaching news
stories to stock price movements that the public has already
observed, thereby enhancing the salience of these movements
and focusing greater attention on them. Or they may remind the
public of past market episodes, or of the likely trading strategies
of others. Thus the media can sometimes foster stronger feed-
back from past price changes to further price changes, and they can
also foster another sequence of events, referred to here as an atten-
tion cascade.
This is not to say that the news media are a monolithic force push-
ing ideas onto a purely passive audience. The media represent a
channel for mass communication and the interpretation of popular
culture, but popular culture has an inherent logic and process of
its own. We turn next to a study of some of the basic ideas in our
culture, whose transformation over time bears a relation to the
changing speculative situation in stock markets.

New Era Economic Thinking
Stock market expansions have
often been associated with pop-
ular perceptions that the future is brighter or less uncertain than
it was in the past. The term new erahas periodically been used to
describe these times.
Of course, there is some obvious validity to the new era notion.
The general trend over the twentieth century has been a rise in the
standard of living and a decline in the impact of economic risks
on individuals. By many measures the world has indeed been grad-
ually growing into a new and better era. But the most salient
characteristic of popular new era thinking is that it is not contin-
uously in evidence; rather, it occurs in pulses.
In contrast to the irregular references to a new era in popular
culture, economists or other influential commentators who have
proclaimed a new era at various times in history have usually been
quite cautious in their choice of words. Often, they merely seem to
be betting on the continuation of long-term trends.
Impressions that the public is affected in different ways at dif-
ferent times by new era thinking—or for that matter by any other
popular economic theory—are hard to pin down. For example, it

NEW ERA ECONOMIC THINKING 97
is difficult to trace the evolution of ideas through questionnaire
survey work, because one only knows to question the public
about specific ideas afterthose ideas have attracted a good deal
ofattention.
We can do word counts of publications using computerized data-
bases, and thereby get some idea of the changing frequency with
which certain economic terms are used, but such searches are crude
and miss the often subtle ways in which the use of the terms
changes over time. When I tried to establish how often the phrase
new erahas been used in the past few years, I found that the term
has been used in so many different contexts that a search on this
phrase alone is not meaningful for our purposes. On the other hand,
I have established from the Nexis database that the term new era
economy did not have any currency until a Business Week cover
story in July 1997 attributed this term to Alan Greenspan, mark-
ing an alleged turning point in his thinking since the “irrational
exuberance” speech some months earlier.1The term new era econ-
omyhas been in regular use ever since. (The association of this term
with one powerful figure provides yet another striking example
of how individual actors or media events can change public
thinking.)
The recent use of the term new erain this context actually pre-
ceded the Business Weekarticle, for a pair of articles in the Boston
Globein June 1997 used the terms new era thesis, new era theorists,
and new era school and identified Ralph Acampora, technical
research director at Prudential Securities, as a member of the
so-called school. In August 1997, a much-talked-about article by
Paul Krugman in the Harvard Business Reviewattacked the newly
prominent new era theory, and this of course gave the term even
greater currency.2 In the decade before 1997, the Nexis search
reveals that the term new erawas used only rarely to denote opti-
mistic economic outlooks; in those years the term apparently had
little currency.
All of these uses of the term new era to describe the economy
occurred after the 1990s stock market had advanced far enough that
it was beginning to amaze people, and all the new era stories fea-
ture the stock market.3It was not as if some economists proclaimed

98 CULTURAL FACTORS
a new era after looking at national income data or other data rel-
evant to the real economic outlook. The new era theory emerged
principally as an after-the-fact interpretation of a stock market boom.
This is surely no surprise. Astock market boom is a dramatic event
that calls for an equally dramatic interpretation. In contrast, an
increase in the growth rate of the gross domestic product—from,
say, 2% to 3%—although perhaps exciting to economists, does not
make the same impression on the general public. It is insubstan-
tial, esoteric, and simply cannot hold its own against the flashier
news offerings bombarding the public.
Whenever the market reaches a new high, public speakers,
writers, and other prominent people suddenly appear, armed with
explanations for the apparent optimism seen in the market.
Reporters may not always get the timing right, and they may sug-
gest that it was the words spoken by these great men and women
that caused the market shifts. Although prominent people can
certainly move markets, often their wisdom merely tags along
withmarket moves. Nevertheless, the new era thinking they pro-
mote is part of the process by which a boom may be sustained and
amplified—part of the feedback mechanism that, as we have seen,
can create speculative bubbles.
Adefender of markets’ rationality might point out that even if
discussions of a new era really are the cause of the boom, it does
not follow that news accounts of these discussions must precede
the boom. Technically, of course, it is possible—in spite of the fact
that most media discussions of new era theories seem to coincide
with or come after stock market booms—that the word-of-mouthdis-
cussions did in fact precede and cause the booms. The news media
might have been late to recognize the discussions.
But that defense of markets’ rationality is not very plausible if
we consider the nature of the thought patterns observed among the
general investing public. There is such lack of interest among the pub-
lic in reasoned arguments about the future course of the corporate
sector that it is highly unlikely that the public could have been har-
boring secret thoughts of a new era in corporate profits unrelated
to past stock price increases.
It appears that most people are not interested in long-run eco-
nomic growth forecasts for the aggregate economy. Economic

theory would suggest that they should be interested, if they are
behaving rationally. But in fact the topic is too abstract, boring, or
technical. The public is interested in expansive descriptions of
future technology—for example, in what amazing new capabilities
computers will soon have—not in gauging the level of U.S. cor-
porate earnings in coming years. In fact, it is doubtful that more
than a small percentage of the populace today could give an esti-
mate of aggregate U.S. corporate earnings accurate within an order
of magnitude. They are hardly likely to be interested in predict-
ing changes in those same earnings.
History does show that there are at times strong unseen forces
within public opinion that are not revealed in the media or in pub-
lic discussions until some key event brings them out of the wood-
work. But such currents in public opinion typically relate to naïve
theories based on personal observations or ill-founded prejudices
against minority groups or foreign countries. The public simply
does not harbor secret opinions about the economic growth rate.4
Conventional wisdom interprets the stock market as reacting to
new era theories. In fact, it appears that the stock market often cre-
atesnew era theories, as reporters scramble to justify stock market
price moves. The situation reminds one of the Ouija board, in
which players are encouraged to interpret the meaning of movements
in their trembling hands and to distill forecasts from them. Or the
stock market is seen as an oracle, issuing mysterious and meaning-
lesspronouncements, which we then ask our leaders to interpret,
mistakenly investing their interpretations with authority.
In this chapter I analyze the “new era” thinking that accompa-
nied previous market peaks in the United States. I also offer some
indications of the public’s thinking in the times when the “new eras”
had run their course. I make liberal use of contemporary quota-
tions, since these provide the most direct evidence of people’s
thoughts and concerns.
The 1901 Optimism: The Twentieth-Century Peak
As noted in Chapter 1, the first of the three major peaks in the price-
earnings ratio since 1881 occurred in June 1901, right at the dawn
of the twentieth century. Prices had achieved spectacular increases

over the preceding twelve months, and in mid-1901 observers
reported real speculative fervor: “The outburst of speculation
duringApril, 1901, was something rarely paralleled in the history
of speculative manias.... The newspapers were full of stories of
hotel waiters, clerks in business offices, even doorkeepers and
dressmakers, who had won considerable fortunes in their specu-
lations. The effect on the public mind may be imagined.”5
With the beginning of the century in January 1901, there was
much talk of the future and of technological progress to come:
“trains [will be] running at 150 miles per hour, ... newspaper pub-
lishers will press the buttons and automotive machinery will do the
rest, ... phonographs as salesmen will sell goods in the big stores
while automatic hands will make change.”6 Guglielmo Marconi
made the first transatlantic radio transmission in 1901, and there
were predictions that we would soon be in radio communication
with the planet Mars.
The Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York, from May 1
to November 1, 1901, emphasized high technology. It had as its
centerpiece the 375-foot Electric Tower, illuminated by 44,000 light
bulbs powered by faraway generators at Niagara Falls. The tower
was “indescribably brilliant” and held visitors “spellbound.”7The
exposition’s Electricity Building featured exhibits about the won-
ders of electricity. There was an electrograph, a machine that
transmitted pictures by wire (forerunner of the fax machine), and
a tel-autograph, a machine that enabled one to transmit one’s
signature over long distances (forerunner of credit card signature-
verification devices). The exposition even offered a simulated trip
to the moon on the airship Luna: the visitor could take a stroll
through the streets and shops of the moon before returning to earth.
In a sense, the high-tech age, the computer age, and the space
age seemed just around the corner in 1901, though the concepts were
expressed in different words than we would use today. People were
upbeat, and in later years the first decade of the twentieth century
came to be called the Age of Optimism, the Age of Confidence,
or the Cocksure Era. The mood was perhaps similar to that of
today, a century later and near the dawn of the twenty-first cen-
tury. Given the modern media’s exploitation of anniversary or

threshold events, and the human tendency to consider such events
as symbolic new beginnings, investing them with exaggerated
hopes and expectations, the transitions to new centuries may tend
to be optimistic times. The 1901 example suggests that new-century
optimism might in fact extend for years beyond 2001.
But there was another reason why people in 1901 thought that
the stock market ought to be highly valued. The most prominent
business news in the papers in recent years had been about the for-
mation of numerous combinations, trusts, and mergers in a wide
variety of businesses, stories such as the formation of U.S. Steel
out of a number of smaller steel companies. Many stock market fore-
casters in 1901 saw these developments as momentous, and the term
community of interestwas commonly used to describe the new econ-
omy dominated by them. AnApril 1901 editorial in the New York
Daily Tribuneexplained:
But a new era has come, the era of “community of interest,” whereby
it is hoped to avoid ruinous price cutting and to avert the destruc-
tion which has in the past, when business depression occurred, over-
taken so many of the competing concerns in every branch of
industry. In the great iron and steel industry, for example, which,
asAndrew Carnegie has said, has been the prince and the pauper
of the industrial world, now highly prosperous again and again
deeply depressed, consolidations of scores of scattered concerns into
a dozen larger ones within the last two years have now been fol-
lowed by the combination of the latter into the most gigantic com-
bination the world has ever known, a combination which, if the
expectations of its projectors are fulfilled, will result in the avoid-
ing of much economic waste through eliminating the possibility of
the erection of unnecessary plants for competitive reasons, in the
effecting of many economies through the abolishing of duplicate offi-
cial positions and establishment of a uniform price list, and in the
enlargement of export trade by reason of the lower prices which can
be fixed in consequence of the various economies coincident to
consolidation.
In the railroad field, too, combination is the ruling idea, and for
the same reasons. Competing roads are being consolidated or leased,
with resulting economy of operation and permanent cessation of rate
cutting, and representatives of powerful roads are going into the
boards of heretofore incorrigible rate cutting lines, in which bodies
they have an influence potent, if not controlling.8

==================================================

102 CULTURAL FACTORS
These reasons for optimism for the stock market are certainly
plausible. It is easily believable that elimination of competition
might create monopoly profits for corporations, thus boosting
their share prices.
But the editorial does not mention the potential for antitrust
lawto end the “community of interest” era. In September 1901, the
pro-business president William McKinley was assassinated while
visiting the Pan-American Exposition; he was succeeded by his
“cowboy” vice president, Teddy Roosevelt. It was only six months
later, in March 1902, that Roosevelt dusted off the almost-forgotten
ShermanAntitrustAct of 1890 and used it against the Northern
Securities Company. Over the next seven years he embarked on
a vigorous antitrust policy. When the defects of the Sherman Act
became apparent, the Clayton AntitrustAct of 1914 furthered the
government’s assault on corporate combinations.
The premise of the “community of interest” theory of stock
prices turned out to be wrong; those who expressed high optimism
for stocks on this basis were not thinking of all that could go wrong.
People were not considering the possibility that society would not
tolerate this shift of wealth toward stockholders. Presumably they
did not consider this because there had not yet been any concrete
antitrust activity.Yet in thinking about the level of the stock mar-
ket, one must of course consider the long-run earnings, spread over
future decades, that the market represents, and of the potential for
society to make adjustments, positive or negative, to control this
earnings stream.
Rarely do discussions of the level of the stock market consider
the possibility of government reaction to the level of profits, even
though government policy toward corporations has changed sub-
stantially and dramatically over time. The corporate profits tax alone
has been adjusted many times, from 0% in 1901, to 1% in 1911, to
10% in 1921, to 14% in 1931, to 31% in 1941, to 50.75% with a 30%
excess-profits tax in 1951, to 35% today. Despite the fact that the
U.S. government’s past actions raised the corporate profits tax from
0% to 50.75%, effectively nationalizing more than half the stock mar-
ket, potential future adjustments in this tax are rarely mentioned
in discussing the outlook for the market.

==================================================

NEW ERA ECONOMIC THINKING 103
The 1901 example illustrates one way in which new era think-
ing can go wrong: such thinking concentrates attention on the effects
of events currently prominent in the news. Little attention is paid
to “what-ifs,” even if they have substantial probability.
There was another important theme in 1901: that stocks were now
being held in “strong hands.” “The ownership of stocks has
changed hands. The public speculators do not now own them. They
are owned by people who are capable of protecting them under
any circumstances, such as the Standard Oil, Morgan, Kuhn Loeb,
Gould and Harriman Interests. These people who are the foremost
financiers of the country evidently know when they go into a propo-
sition what ultimate results may be expected.”9This theory, like
theories expressed at other market peaks, finds it inconceivable that
there could be a selling panic. In the shortest run, perhaps this theory
was right. But those strong hands did not stop the stock market
crash of 1907, nor the dramatic slide of stock values between 1907
and 1920.
The 1920s Optimism
The bull market of the 1920s was apparently a time of relatively
great public enthusiasm for and interest in the stock market, and
the enthusiasm seemed to peak in 1929 with the market. In his 1931
bookOnly Yesterday,Frederick Lewis Allen wrote of 1929:
The rich man’s chauffeur drove with his ears laid back to catch the
news of an impending move in Bethlehem Steel; he held 50 shares
himself on a twenty-point margin. The window cleaner at the bro-
ker’s office paused to watch the ticker, for he was thinking of con-
verting his laboriously accumulated savings into a few shares of
Simmons. Edwin Lefevre (an articulate reporter on the market at
this time who could claim a considerable personal experience) told
of a broker’s valet who made nearly a quarter of a million in the mar-
ket; of a trained nurse who cleaned up thirty thousand following
the tips given her by grateful patients; of a Wyoming cattleman, thirty
miles from the nearest railroad, who bought or sold a thousand
shares a day.10
Although this account may create an exaggerated impression of the
level of public attention to the stock market, there is no question

that attention was much keener in the 1920s than at other times,
and that enthusiastic investors were not hard to find.
The 1920s were a time of rapid economic growth and, in par-
ticular, of the widespread dissemination of some technological inno-
vations that had formerly been available only to the wealthy. The
automobile came into common use at roughly this time. In 1914
there had been only 1.7 million automobiles registered in the United
States, but by 1920 there were 8.1 million and by 1929 there were
23.1 million. The automobile brought with it a new sense of free-
dom and possibility, and a widespread awareness that these per-
sonal values could be attained by new technology.
The 1920s were also the time when the electrification of the
country was extended beyond the major cities, which had already
been electrified. By 1929, 20 million U.S. homes were wired.
Kerosene lamps were out; electric light bulbs were in. By 1929,
nearly half of all wired homes had vacuum cleaners, and a third
had washing machines. Moreover, the 1920s saw the expansion
of radio broadcasting and the development of radio as a mature
national entertainment medium. In 1920 there were only three radio
stations in the entire United States; by 1923 there were over five
hundred. Nationally known radio stars like Rudy Vallee and
nationally popular shows like Amos ’n’ Andy appeared in the
1920s. The National Broadcasting Company formed the first
national network in 1926, and regular shows created a sense of
national culture previously unknown. Sound also invaded our
movies. Lee De Forest invented the sound-on-film system in 1923,
and talkies had completely displaced silent movies by the end of
the decade. Because these innovations had such an impact on every-
day lives, affecting people in their homes and in their hours of
leisure, the 1920s were a time when massive technological progress
was unusually apparent to even the most casual observer.
There were, at the time of the 1920s stock market boom, many
clear statements proclaiming a new era for the economy. For
example, as early as 1925 we hear, “There is nothing now to be fore-
seen which can prevent the United States from enjoying an era of
business prosperity which is entirely without equal in the pages
of trade history.”11

NEW ERA ECONOMIC THINKING 105
John Moody, head of Moody’s Investors Service, a rating agency,
said in an article about the stock market in 1928, “In fact, a new
age is taking form throughout the entire civilized world; civi-
lization is taking on new aspects. We are only now beginning to
realize, perhaps, that this modern, mechanistic civilization in which
we live is now in the process of perfecting itself.”12
Given the public enthusiasm for stocks and the enormous run-
up in the market, there was a corresponding demand for books
that interpreted and justified the market boom. In 1929, Charles
Amos Dice, in New Levels in the Stock Market,gave a number of rea-
sons to expect the increase to continue. He preferred the term new
worldtonew era,but the idea was the same. He wrote of a “new
world of industry,” referring to techniques of mass production,
large research departments, the beginning of the electrical age, the
industrialization of the South, the emergence of large-scale pro-
duction, and the mechanization of agriculture. Furthermore Dice
wrote of a “new world of distribution,” predicting the prolifer-
ation of installment credit, the chain-store movement, new tech-
niques of advertising that would stimulate demand, and new
market research techniques. He also spoke of a “new world of
finance,” referring to the expansion of investment banking to
provide new sources of funds for corporations, the rise of the hold-
ing company as a tool to make financing more flexible, and
advances in the Federal Reserve System’s understanding of how
to stabilize business. Dice described the Federal Reserve as anal-
ogous to the governor on a steam engine, regulating the speed of
the economy.13
The Dice book, curiously, was printed in August 1929, a month
before the peak of the market prior to the onset of the depression.
The timing of the book’s appearance seems even more remarkable
when one finds attached at page 69 a small slip of paper entitled
“Errata.” The slip, apparently added after the text was printed but
before the book was bound, notes that the Dow Jones Industrial
Average rose on September 3, 1929, to over 20 points above the level
indicated in the book. The slip of paper instructs the reader to adjust
upward the projections for the Dow given in the printed book by
15 to 20 points. Thus Dice managed to time his book for the exact

peak of the market, and thus to make the most catastrophic error
possible in forecasting the market.
Prof. Irving Fisher at Yale, who has been described as one of
America’s most eminent economists, argued that the U.S. stock mar-
ket was not at all overvalued. He was quoted as saying just before
the peak in 1929 that “stock prices have reached what looks like
a permanently high plateau.” He wrote a book entitled The Stock
Market Crash—And After,with a preface dated less than two months
after Black Thursday. Fisher must have been working on this
book at the same time as Dice was writing his, but his timing was
not so bad. The 1929 crash came while he was still at work on the
book. Yet Fisher was still able to be optimistic after the crash,
especially since the market had gone down only a fraction of the
distance it ultimately would by 1932, and the crash did not yet seem
to signal anything like the end of an era.
Fisher argued in his book that the outlook was for rapidly
increasing earnings for a number of reasons, some of them paral-
lel to those cited by Dice. First, he pointed out that the merger move-
ment of the 1920s allowed economies of large-scale production. He
noted that “the economies from mergers take time to develop, while
the effect on the stock market of their formation is instant.” Scientific
research and invention were proceeding at a faster pace than
before. The advantages of the automobile were only just beginning
to be exploited, with the development of a rapidly widening net-
work of surfaced highways. Much was being learned about the effi-
cient use of waste products. In agriculture, recent inventions
included subsoil plowing, better fertilizers, enhanced breeds of farm
animals, and new and improved crops.As all of these inventions
came gradually to be applied, further earnings increases could be
anticipated from them. Fisher also maintained that the management
ofAmerican corporations was improving, thanks to the application
of “scientific” methods, improved layouts of manufacturing facil-
ities, and more sophisticated management techniques. Businesses
were able to plan better for the future, he claimed, partly because
of his own invention of “master-charting,” a pencil-and-paper
method of priority planning for executives. Fisher also was encour-
aged by his perception that labor unions were now accepting joint
responsibility for the solution of industrial problems.14

NEW ERA ECONOMIC THINKING 107
Others argued that the market valuations of the 1920s were
sound because we were in a more sober time—and not just figu-
ratively. The prohibition of alcoholic beverages was thought to be
a sign of greater steadiness and intelligence: “Many different
things contributed to this happy result.... [including] the elimi-
nation from our national life of the saloon and its destructive ele-
ments, and consequent comparative sobriety among the population
as a whole. Most of the money formerly spent in the saloon has since
gone into continually higher standards of living, investments and
savings banks.”15
Of course, optimistic sentiments for the market were not the
onlysentiments expressed at the time. The high price of the mar-
ket relative to rough measures of fundamental value did not go un-
noticed in 1929. The New York Times and the Commercial and
Financial Chronicleconsistently pointed out what they interpreted
as speculative excess. Paul M. Warburg of the International Accep-
tance Bank decried the “unrestrained speculation.”16Yet we know,
from the level of the stock market itself, that the weight of public
sentiment was overwhelmingly positive in the 1920s.
New Era Thinking of the 1950s and 1960s
New era thinking also seemed, judging from media accounts, to
undergo a sudden surge in the mid-1950s, when the market
increased 94.3% in real (inflation-corrected) terms between Sep-
tember 1953 and December 1955. The market had been stalled dur-
ing most of the early 1950s, amid lingering fears that the economy
might sink back into a depression now that the stimulus of
increased World War II production was absent. But the sudden near-
doubling in the stock market, supported by a solid growth in
earnings, apparently caused the investing public to forget such fears
and to indulge in genuine new era thinking. In May 1955 U.S. News
and World Reportwrote:
Once again the feel of a “new era” is in the air. Confidence is high,
optimism almost universal, worry largely absent.
War is receding as a threat. Peace is a growing prospect. Jobs are
quite plentiful. Pay never was so good. The promise is that taxes
will be cut. Everywhere things are in a rising trend.

Three times in 10 years a depression scare has come and gone with-
out amounting to much. The first scare came in 1946, right after World
War II. Military spending was cut drastically with scarcely a ripple.
The second scare came in 1949. The public went right on buying,
oblivious to the worries of businessmen, and this scare faded. The
third scare began in mid-1953. It now is little more than a memory.17
The sense that investors were terribly optimistic and confident
of the market was in and of itself part of the new era thinking.
Newsweekwrote in December 1955 that “basic to the upsurge [in
the stock market] was an investor faith in the overwhelming
strength of the economy—and the fact that corporations were
cashing in on this prosperity.”18
In a development strongly paralleling the evolution of radio in
the 1920s as the vehicle for a mass national culture, the early
1950s had seen the widespread introduction of television. In 1948
only 3% of U.S. families owned television sets; by 1955 76% did.
Like the Internet, television was a vivid technological innovation
that captured the imagination of almost everyone. It was evidence
for technological progress that could not be overlooked; within a
few short years the majority of Americans began regularly spend-
ing hours watching an electronic device.
Inflation was very low at the time, and people credited this to
newly enlightened Fed policy. Treasury Secretary George Humphrey
boasted in 1955 that
In the past 2-3/4 years, the value of the dollar has changed only one-
half of one cent. We have kept inflation’s hand out of your savings
almost entirely.
We regard inflation as a public enemy of the worst type. But we
have not hesitated, either, to ease or restrict the basis of credit
when need was indicated. The full force of monetary policy has been
made effective more promptly than ever before to respond to nat-
ural demands. This has been done by the timely use of monetary
policy and credit; by the return to the public of purchasing power
through the biggest tax cut in the history of the nation; by cutting
unjustified Government spending; by timely encouragement to
construction, home building and needed improvements.19
Something analogous to the “strong hands” theme seen in the
1920s—the idea that the demand for stocks was stable enough to

prevent any downturn—was present in the 1950s as well. Newsweek
wrote in 1955:
Many financial men like to think that the nation has developed a
“new capitalism” with an ever-broadening base. Some 7.5 million
people hold stock in publicly owned corporations, compared with
6.5 million three years ago. Assets of mutual funds, which give the
small investor a chance to spread his risk, have soared from $1.3 bil-
lion in 1946 to $7.2 billion. Thousands of workers have become own-
ers of the firms they work for via employee stock-purchase plans.
All this may not add up to an absolute guarantee against another
’29, but most experts are confident that it goes a long way.20
The idea that Irving Fisher had presented in the 1920s as a rea-
son for optimism, that businesses were able to plan better for the
future, was floated again as a new idea in the 1950s: “there is a new
attitude of business itself that promises to avoid deep depressions
in the future. Business firms today make long-term plans and
appear to be less influenced than in the past by short-term fluc-
tuations in activity.”21
The Baby Boom was seen as another important factor driving
prosperity and the market, because people needed to spend money
on their babies (just as the grown-up babies themselves, despite
having fewer children, are now perceived as bidding up stock prices
as they save for their retirement): “It is this boom in babies that is
being counted on now to make the latest ‘new era’ different from
the last one. Families are growing bigger. Good roads and fine auto-
mobiles are opening the countryside. The urge is toward suburban
living and for houses with three or four bedrooms instead of one
or two.”22
The increase in the use of consumer credit was also cited, as it
had been in the 1920s, as a reason to expect prosperity: “This will-
ingness to lay out cash amounted, in the opinion of one influential
Washington individual, to a ‘consumer spending revolution.’ ...
In spending his money, the average individual’s wants have grad-
ually been upgraded.”23
With the election of John Kennedy as president in 1960, and given
his advocacy of economic stimulus measures, it was generally
thought that the economy ought to do especially well. Kennedy

inspired confidence beginning with his initial State of the Union
message in 1961. He was perceived as showing vision and opti-
mism, and he hit upon a dramatic symbol for that vision by
promising, in a special message to Congress in May 1961, that the
United States would land men on the moon before 1970. Ameri-
cans expected that such an achievement would be remembered for
centuries, marking as it would humankind’s first escape from its
planet of origin. Kennedy was viewed as the incarnation of our
national optimism and of the strength of the stock market: “Wall
Street has a simple description for the phenomenal strength of stock
prices, ‘The Kennedy Market.’” The confidence inspired by the
Kennedy economic program led some to conclude that the country
was entering a “new economy” in which “businessmen can enjoy
reasonably continuous prosperity indefinitely” and that there was
“morejustification for confidence” in monetary policy than in times
past.24The Kennedy initiatives were expanded on by the “Great
Society”program of his successor, Lyndon Johnson, beginning in
1964; Johnson’s program set as its primary goals nothing less
than an end to poverty and urban decay.
In the 1960s, the theory that the stock market is the “best invest-
ment” was prominent: “Investors feel that stocks are the best
investment medium—as a hedge against possible inflation, as a
means of participating in the future growth of business.” “Investors
seem to be betting that inflation will accompany recovery—and that
common stocks, even at present prices, represent the only real
hedge.”25At that time, investors believed that if inflation broke out,
the stock market would go up, rather than down, as is now com-
monly thought, and that therefore the prospect of inflation was a
reason to own stocks. There was concern in the early 1960s that,
even though there was virtually no inflation, the Kennedy-Johnson
economic programs could become inflationary.
Apossibly significant factor behind the 1960s market peak was
the Dow’s approach to 1,000. That the approach of a new milestone
such as a four-digit Dow would have an impact on the public imag-
ination may seem silly, but, given the lack of any other solid basis
for the market’s valuation, talk of such an arbitrary level pro-
vided a solid anchor for people’s expectations.

==================================================

NEW ERA ECONOMIC THINKING 111
Even before the Dow got close to 1,000, the press was counting
the milestones. A1965 Business Week article noted that “Like the
four-minute mile, psychological barriers are made to be cracked.
It’s no less so in Wall Street, where the 900 ‘magic’ mark on the Dow-
Jones industrial average (as the 600, 700, and 800 marks before it)
will probably crumble sooner or later.” Newsweek wrote that the
900 barrier had reached “almost mystical significance in the minds
of many observers.” In 1966, when the 1,000 level loomed, Time
wrote that “At week’s end the average had reached 986.13, less than
14 points from the 1000 mark that the Street considers a mystical
number. Even though that number may be more mystical than
meaningful, the date of the breakthrough will appear in history
books of decades, or perhaps even centuries, to come—and the date
is not far off.”26 The market appears to have raced to just under
1,000, but it would not pass the magic number for a long time.
Although the Dow was not then computed on a minute-by-minute
basis, it finally rose above 1,000 (if computed using the highs for
the day) in January 1966. It was not until 1972, the eve of the stock
market crash, that it closed above 1,000, and even then it stayed
above 1,000 only briefly.
The Dow did not rise solidly above 1,000 until 1982, and, if one
computes a real stock price, it did not rise above the 1966 high in
real terms—and stay above it—until January 1992, twenty-six
years later.27 The period from January 1966 to January 1992 was
one of low returns, confined as it was (with no capital gain) to
income from dividends; the average annual real stock market return
was only 4.1% per year.28These are signs consistent with a notion
that the market was in some sense “reaching” toward 1,000 in 1966,
and that it became relatively overpriced.
New Era Thinking during
the Bull Market of the 1990s
I have already described some of the new era thinking that char-
acterized the 1990s in Chapter 2. Here I make just a few additional
observations and then contrast the modern new era thinking with
that during the new eras described in this chapter.



==================================================
                     PAGE 135                     
==================================================

112 CULTURAL FACTORS
As with all major stock market booms, there have been writers
during the 1990s who offer new era theories to justify the market.
Michael Mandel, writing in Business Week in 1996 in an article
entitled “The Triumph of the New Economy,” listed five reasons
for his belief that the market is not crazy: increased globalization,
the boom in high-tech industries, moderating inflation, falling
interest rates, and surging profits.29
Aprominent theory during this boom has been that low infla-
tion makes for a strong market outlook. In the 1990s, theories
about inflation dominated discussion of the market outlook just
as they did in the 1960s, but now the prevalent theory has been
reversed. In the 1990s, it was thought that if inflation were to
break out the market would go down rather than up. The idea that
the stock market is a good investment because it is a hedge against
inflation (i.e., that it will go up if there is an outbreak of inflation)
was dead.
Why did people in the 1990s think that inflation would push the
market down, whereas in the 1960s they thought it would push
it up? In the 1990s, investors may have been reacting to a literature
published by economists showing that economies do more poorly
during sudden outbursts of very high inflation. In fact, these stud-
ies do not show much of a relation between moderate or long-run
inflation and real economic performance; over the relevant range,
they would suggest that the 1960s-era theory was right—that the
real value of the stock market should be relatively immune to news
of inflation, and that the stock market should move with con-
sumer prices, not against them.30More likely, people in the 1990s
were reacting to the fact that the stock market had in recent years
moved against inflation, rather than with it.
Many of the same themes that appeared in the 1920s, 1950s, and
1960s after stock market booms were repeated in the 1990s.
Roger Bootle, in his 1998 book The Death of Inflation,argued that
the “inflationary era,” during which “managed capitalism” and
strong labor unions have induced an inflationary spiral, is draw-
ing to a close. In “managed capitalism,” “prices were decided, not
determined by the interplay of interpersonal supply and demand.”
Now, Bootle declared, we are entering the “zero era,” brought on

NEW ERA ECONOMIC THINKING 113
by global capitalism, privatization, and the decline of labor
unions, all of which make it impossible for prices to be decided
by committee.31
Steven Weber, with his 1997 article “The End of the Business
Cycle” in the public policy journal Foreign Affairs, argued that
macroeconomic risks are lower now: “Changes in technology,
ideology, employment and finance, along with the globalization
of production and consumption, have reduced the volatility of eco-
nomic activity in the industrialized world. For both empirical
and theoretical reasons in advanced industrial economies the
waves of the business cycle may be becoming more like ripples.”
Weber presented a number of reasonable-sounding arguments. For
instance, he noted that the economy has come to be dominated by
the service sector in a way that it was not thirty years ago, and he
pointed out that service employment has always been more stable
than industrial production.32
Downsizing and restructuring—terms describing so-called man-
agerial revolutions in the 1980s—were thought then to be impor-
tant reasons for the growth of profits since 1982. The thought that
they are still sources of profit growth still lingers in some people’s
minds.Yet there has also been substantial skepticism about these
managerial revolutions, as exemplified by the comic strip Dilbert,
which dwells on petty labor-management conflicts in the new
era economy.
It should be noted that not all stories in the media in the 1990s
were slanted toward new era emphases when compared with
stories during earlier episodes of high pricing. I could not find 1990s
accounts that were as expansively and breathlessly optimistic as
some in 1901 or 1929, and although there is much optimism in the
media in the 1990s, it is usually a matter of background presump-
tion rather than bold assertion. There appears to have been a media
attitude change, and optimistic hyperbole was out in the 1990s.
Many writers seemed, if anything, rather more influenced by con-
cerns about market overpricing and speculative mania. In fact, many
media accounts in the mid- to late 1990s have focused on what
theyconsider the craziness of investors. For example, a Fortunestory
inApril 1996 told of reporters stopping random people on the street

and asking them for stock tips. They stopped a policeman, a Star-
bucks barista, a carpenter on a billboard crew, and an ID checker
at a fitness club, and all them offered expansive stock recom-
mendations. They could not find a shoeshine boy, but otherwise
their experience mirrored that of Bernard Baruch before the crash
of 1929, who remarked that he had received stock tips from the
shoeshine boy and interpreted that as a sign of market excess.33
Articles with titles like “Gamblers High: Is This a Market Where
Yesterday’sYardsticks Don’t Apply?” or “It’s Tulip Time on Wall
Street” or “Say Goodbye to the Last Bear” abounded. The possi-
bility that the stock market boom is a speculative bubble was cer-
tainly thrust before the minds of readers in the 1990s.
The Ends of New Eras
Despite the suggestion inherent in the phrase speculative bubblethat
there may be a dramatic burst—a stock market crash—speculative
bubbles and their associated new era thinking do not end defini-
tively with a sudden, final crash. Upon reflection this is not sur-
prising, given that stock prices are essentially formed in the minds
of the millions of investors who buy and sell stocks, and it is unlikely
that so many people would simultaneously arrive at sudden and
enduring changes in their long-run perceptions.
People today remember the stock market crash of 1929 as occur-
ring in one or two days. In fact, after that crash, the market recov-
ered almost all of its lost ground by early 1930. The significance
of 1929 is not the one-day drops in October, but the fact that that
year marked the beginning of the end: the beginning of the three-
year period that reversed much of the stock market gains of the
1920s. The same is true of other stock market drops. One-day events
do not figure prominently, except as symbols of the malaise in the
markets.
I noted in Chapter 1 that the high pricing of the market in 1901
was not followed by any immediate or dramatic price decline, but
rather that prices ceased to increase and that eventually, after
some twenty years had elapsed, the market had lost most of the
real value it had had in 1901. The change took so long to work itself

out that it is rather more generational in character, and therefore
it is hard to find comment about in the media.
If we look at 1920–21, when the real stock market was at its low-
est since 1901, discussions of the stock market centered on what had
gone wrong; the glowing descriptions of future prosperity seen in
1901 were no longer to be found. The biggest factor in most com-
mentary of the period centers on the 1920–21 recession, which was
unusually severe. Coverage centered on recent losses by business-
men and on paper fortunes that had disappeared. In place of the
“community of interest” keeping prices up, there was instead dis-
cussion of hostility from farmers and shippers toward railroads, of
customers demanding reductions in rates. The cancellation of gov-
ernment contracts following the world war was thought to have
revealed weakness in existing businesses. Strained political condi-
tions abroad following the war were also viewed as a negative
factor for the U.S. economy. The actions of “conscienceless” short
sellers or bear raiders were considered negative influences on the
market, as were the effects of tax-loss selling for income tax purposes.
There is some evidence that investors in 1921 had learned not
to be influenced by exaggerated claims and inflated schemes. A1921
article in the Saturday Evening Post by Albert Atwood describes
highly speculative prices as a thing of the past and quotes a stock-
broker as saying that “the promotions of the last few years have
been neither as wild nor as fantastic as those of the boom period
of 1900 and 1901.”
Another theme running through accounts of the period is that
market psychology somehow mysteriously changes, and that it had,
at that time, become inexplicably negative. Atwood quotes a
banker in 1921: “All the world got together to drive down prices,
and when the whole world makes up its mind, when everyone
thinks alike and is determined that prices shall go lower, nothing
can resist the movement.”34
The end of the 1929 new era thinking was more dramatic and
directly tied to the Great Depression that followed; by 1932 it was
already plain that the United States was into the deepest depres-
sion it had ever experienced, and there seemed to be prima facie
evidence that the new era was over. The optimists who had been

extolling a bright future for the economy were silenced by events
that deviated so markedly from their forecasts that it seemed they
could not be explained by any convenient adjustments in theories.
Economic forecasters demonstrated extreme uncertainty about
the future, and observers of consumer behavior claimed that con-
sumeruncertainty had stalled demand.35
The depression of the 1930s was a time of widespread concern
that our economic system was failing. Oscar Lange, a University
of Chicago professor of economics, wrote in the American Economic
Reviewin 1939 that “the view is widely held that the American econ-
omy has lost its momentum of expansion and reached a stage of
more or less permanent stagnation.”36
The perceived failure of capitalism ushered in the heyday of
Communism in the United States. Communism seemed to many
to be the wave of the future, even inevitable. Many of the best writ-
ers of the era became openly sympathetic to Communism in the
1930s, including Kenneth Burke, Erskine Caldwell, Robert Cantwell,
Jack Conroy, Edward Dahlberg, John Dos Passos, James Farrell,
Langston Hughes, and William Saroyan.37
Further evidence of the loss of hope for the uncontrolled capi-
talist economy can be seen in the ascendance of radical political
movements abroad. The rise of Nazism in Germany is itself a telling
symptom of the widespread despair that took hold of many
people’s thinking after 1929. The change in mindset of the German
public within the space of a few years seems astonishing, and it
is a useful reminder of how changeable any public mood may be.
The end of 1965 new era thinking was associated with the appear-
ance of high inflation. The Kennedy administration’s claim that it
could lower unemployment through high-pressure economics
was found to be false; in fact we entered a period of “stagflation,”
with both high unemployment and high inflation. In 1974, Arthur
Okun, who had been a staff member of the Council of Economic
Advisors under President Kennedy and later its chairman, called
the attempt at high-pressure economics “one of the greatest failures
of economic analysis in modern times.” Inflation was seen as a
significant brake on the economic outlook. Arthur Burns, the
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said, “No country that I

know of has been able to maintain widespread economic prosperity
once inflation got out of hand.”38Even though this fact is unsup-
ported by economic analysis, there was a general perception that
it was true.39
By the early 1980s, there was a widespread feeling that the United
States was losing its preeminence to Japan. In a USATodayarticle
entitled “How Japan Is Taking Over Our Markets,” an expert is
quoted as saying, “The only problem is that no targeted industry
in history—not autos, not steel, ball bearings, televisions, motor-
cycles—has been able to cope with the onslaught from the Japa-
nese.” Japan was seen then as especially strong in the high-tech
fields, in which our past successes had always been integral to our
national self-esteem and identity.
Ends of new eras seem to be periods when the national focus
of debate can no longer be upbeat. At such times, a public speaker
may still think that it would be good business to extol a vision of
a brilliant future for our nation’s economy, but it is simply not
credible to do so. One could, at such times, present a case that the
economy must recover, as it always has, and that the stock mar-
ket is underpriced and should go up, but public speakers who make
such a case cannot achieve the command of public attention they
do after a major stock market run-up and economic boom. There
are times when an audience is receptive to optimistic statements
and times when it is not.

New Eras and Bubbles
around the World
Large stock market moves like
the U.S. examples I discussed in
the last chapter have also occurred in many other countries over
the years, affording us numerous other observations. These sug-
gest that speculative bubbles—periods of exaggerated but tem-
porary investor enthusiasm, often associated with “new era”
theories—are in fact commonplace.
In this chapter, I examine the largest recent stock market moves
around the world. For some of these, I rely on accounts by the
news media. Of course, media accounts are not always reliable, and
I cannot claim to have done exhaustive research on any of these
examples. However, they illustrate the significance in these countries
of factors I have identified in previous chapters as important in U.S.
stock market moves. I show that the record price movements in these
countries have tended to be reversed afterward—as one would
expect if bubbles were common among them.

even in percentage terms. For example, the 184.8% real U.S. stock
market increase fromApril 1994 to April 1999 almost makes the
list of the biggest five-year price increases. In addition, the U.S. stock

The rightmost column in each of the tables also shows, whenever

there is considerable variability across these countries as to whether

the market continued in the same direction over the subsequent inter-
val or reversed itself. At the end of this chapter, I describe what we
know about the sequelae of the large price changes tabulated here.
Stories Associated with the Largest Price Changes
It is easier to find stories associated with one-year price changes than
with five-year price changes. Five years is such a long time that fac-
tors underlying the rise or decline in stock markets are often lost from
public consciousness, being seen as underlying trends rather than
salient events. Fortunately for our purposes, fourteen of the twenty-
five five-year intervals of real price increase shown in Table6.3 con-
tain twelve-month intervals shown in Table6.1, and eleven of the
twenty-five five-year intervals of real price decline shown in
Table6.4 contain twelve-month intervals shown in Table6.2.
Some of the twelve-month price increases seem to be associated
with good reasons for a rational price change. This is especially
sofor the very largest one-year changes: typically something very
unusual was going on. But even in these cases, there often seems
to be a suggestion of some market overreaction to events.
The biggest one-year real stock market increase of all, in the
Philippines from December 1985 to December 1986, was an amaz-
ing 683.4%. The biggest five-year real price change, of 1,253%, also
occurred in the Philippines. The five-year period, from November
1984 to November 1989, included the record one-year period.
During the twelve-month period from December 1985 to Decem-
ber 1986 the regime of Ferdinand Marcos collapsed, Marcos fled
the country, and a new government led by Corazon Aquino took
charge of the country. In the period just before the price increase,
a Communist insurgency had threatened to turn the country into
another Vietnam. The Marcos government had assassinated Cora-
zonAquino’s husband. There were demonstrations in the streets.
It was in general a time of enormous uncertainty about the future.
With the new government in place, the country developed renewed
hope: a “new era” certainly seemed at hand. Moreover, the price
changes were not reversed during the subsequent one- or five-year
intervals, as can be seen from the tables.

124 CULTURAL FACTORS
One might suspect that the very low values for the Philippine
stock market in December 1985, at the beginning of the record
twelve-month period, were the result of a sort of negative bubble.
Indeed, three of the top twenty five-year price decreases shown in
Table 6.4 occurred in the Philippines by 1985. The Philippine stock
market had a truly dismal record prior to its spectacular increase.
Newspaper accounts in 1985 and earlier puzzled over the unusu-
ally low price-earnings ratios, often around 4. When viewed from
this perspective, the largest stock increase in our tables was but a
reversal of a series of decreases.
The second biggest one-year increase (October 1986 to Octo-
ber 1987) and the biggest one-year decrease (October 1989 to
October 1990) both occurred in Taiwan. Taiwan is also the home
of the seventh-largest five-year increase, from May 1986 to May
1991, and to the twenty-seventh-largest five-year decrease, from
October 1988 to October 1993.
During the year of the highest speculative increase in Taiwan,
October 1986 to October 1987, there were some impressive “new
era” reasons for optimism. Booming exports had pushed economic
growth rates into the double-digit range, and it was widely pre-
dicted that with this steep growth trajectory the economy would
soon be producing such high-tech items as computer chips. The new
affluence was visible everywhere: expensive foreign cars cruised
the streets of Taipei and businessmen freely downed $100 bottles
of wine at glamorous new restaurants. Even so, the savings rate
was very high, and the country was investing heavily in its future.
In the fall of 1987, after a series of antigovernment street demon-
strations, the government finally lifted the martial law that had been
in force since 1949 and also allowed the formation of opposition
parties for the first time. Later in that twelve-month period, in Sep-
tember 1987, the government made two historic and highly visible
announcements: permitting foreign investors to establish companies
in Taiwan and allowing Taiwanese citizens to visit their relatives
on the mainland for the first time since 1949.
Despite these good reasons to anticipate the dawning of a “new
era” in the Taiwanese economy, there still seemed to many observers
to be an air of speculative excess to the Taiwan stock market of

1986–87. Volume of trade soared, increasing sevenfold from Jan-
uary to September 1987, to exceed the combined volume of all Asian
markets excluding Japan.3Price-earnings ratios reached 45, com-
pared with 16 at the beginning of the year.
Taiwan was in the grip of a gambling fever that expressed itself
in other venues besides the stock market. An illegal numbers game,
called TaChia Le or Happiness for All, unknown until 1986, sud-
denly becamea national obsession. It was so popular that “on days
when winning numbers are announced, peasants neglect[ed] their
fields and workers fail[ed] to report to their factories.”4
ATaiwanese student of mine at Yale later confided to me that,
while he was still a teenager in Taiwan in 1987, his mother had
forced him to go regularly to the stock exchange, observe the trad-
ing, and report back to her if something significant should happen.
It was while carrying out these surveillance missions that he
became convinced, he told me, of the utter madness of the spec-
ulative situation.
The Taiwan stock market increase was not reversed right away:
over the year following the year of most rapid price increase there
was yet another increase. But starting a year later, we see the 74.9%
decline in the Taiwan stock market, the biggest one-year decline
on our list.
The third-largest one-year price increase, of 384.6%, occurred in
Venezuela between January 1990 and January 1991. This price surge
came on the heels of a severe economic slump that had produced
an economic growth rate of –8%, an unemployment rate of 10%,
and inflation of 85% in 1989.5Then the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait
(fromAugust 1990 to February 1991) resulted in an interruption
of Persian Gulf oil supplies, a rapid rise in international oil prices,
and increased demand for Venezuelan oil. The stage was set for
a time of sudden prosperity in Venezuela. The Kuwaiti experience
supposedly convinced investors of the importance of Venezuela
as an alternate oil supplier outside the unstable Persian Gulf. But
this seems unlikely as a rational explanation for the run-up in the
Venezuelan stock market, because the potential for disruptions
of Persian Gulf oil supplies was already known long before the
invasion. President Carlos Andres Perez warned that “Venezuela

is living with a totally artificial economy” supported only by the
oil price increase; nevertheless the stock market soared.6The price
increase was not reversed in the subsequent year, but by January
1993 Venezuelan real stock prices had lost 60.3% of their January
1991 value, and by January 1999 they had lost 82.0% of that value.
The fourth-largest one-year price increase, at 360.9%, took place
in Peru fromAugust 1992 to August 1993. The increase occurred
after a stock market plunge in April 1992, when Alberto Fujimori
seized dictatorial powers, dissolving congress and suspending the
constitution amid a protracted civil war with the Shining Path guer-
rillas. But in September 1992 the Shining Path leadership was cap-
tured, and by April 1993 democracy had been restored in Peru,
ending fourteen years of guerrilla violence that had killed 27,000
people. Inflation had reached7,000% and economic growth was
negative in 1990, but by 1993 inflation was being brought under
control and economic growth was positive. Awonderful sense of
a “new era” was certainly in evidence—but a quadrupling of stock
prices within a year left many wondering if the increase was exces-
sive. The market did go up a bit more the following year, and then
it lost a little of its value. By January 1999 the real level of the mar-
ket was lower, but only by 8%. Of all our examples, the Peruvian
stock market increase looks least like a speculative bubble; rather
it seems to have been properly motivated by genuinely positive, fun-
damental news.
The stock market increase in India fromApril 1991 to April 1992,
eleventh on the list in Table 6.1, began just as the assassination
of Rajiv Gandhi in May 1991 ended the thirty-eight-year Nehru
family dynasty. Gandhi’s successor immediately appointed Man-
mohan Singh, a former professor at the Delhi School of Econom-
ics, as finance minister, and the new government announced a
deregulation plan that was viewed as a substantial turn away
from socialism. Foreign investment was now invited. Singh pre-
sented a budget plan that exempted financial assets from the cal-
culation of the wealth tax. Previously, managers had tried to keep
their companies’ share prices as low as possible to avoid taxation;
now they took steps to encourage high prices. The budget plan also
reduced regulations on the pricing and timing of new stock issues.

NEW ERAS AND BUBBLES AROUND THE WORLD 127
These reforms were certainly plausible reasons for a stock market
increase, but the actual increase was widely described as excessive,
and authorities warned the nation of the potential for speculative
excess. This was also a time of widespread attempts at stock price
manipulation. The machinations of Harshad “Big Bull” Mehta, a
Mumbai stockbroker, set off a national scandal in 1992, after the
market peak had been reached. He was described as creating a “vor-
tex effect” in individual stocks by buying in the market, selling at
depressed prices to friendly institutions, and then buying again in
the now-diminished pool of available shares, thereby pushing prices
up.7The 1992 rise in Indian stock prices is now referred to as the
“Mehta Peak.” It was indeed a peak, since the market fell 50.3%
during the following year.
In these examples, there was always some event, or series of
events, outside the market itself that suggested the start of a gen-
uine new era. Even if the market was believed to be overreacting
to the event, it is hard to argue with any certainty that this was the
case. In some of the other large price increases, on the other hand,
there are no such plausible explanations for the magnitude of the
price changes, and media interpretations therefore center on re-
interpretations of long-term processes or on market psychology.
For example, in the Italian stock market boom of May 1985 to
May 1986, when the market rose 166.4% in real terms, it was noted
that economic growth was solid, that inflation remained low, and
that the government of Prime Minister Bettino Craxi was stable
and well liked. But none of this was really news. One Italian news-
paper quoted an analyst as saying, “There are no explanations. ...
Everyone has gone crazy and that’s it. This is a collective madness;
total. It is useless to try to understand, to stop or to guide.”8The
Financial Timesof London said, “Afever has gripped Italy: hundreds
of first-time small investors are pouring money into the stock mar-
ket as though they were buying lottery tickets.”9The real level of
the Italian market fell by 15.7% the following year. By September
1992 the Italian market had lost 68.0% of its May 1986 real value.
In France at around the same time, investors’ “love affair with
the market”10surprised observers by its intensity and lack of good
explanation, and the French stock market makes our list, increasing

282.6% in real terms from March 1982 to March 1987. The “new era”
story that the French government under François Mitterrand was
departingfrom its socialist rigidity seemed inadequate to explain
the market surge. Rather, if there was a new era, it seemed to
many observers to be only in terms of market psychology, with
French investors embracing free markets with renewed ardor. This
period of enthusiasm was followed by the worldwide stock mar-
ket crash of 1987, which set the French stock market back as well,
although it still managed to gain another 10.2% over the succeed-
ing five years, March 1987 to March 1992. Curiously, the French mar-
ket went upward from there, with the growth of French real stock
prices between 1992 and the turn of the millennium almost as
dramatic, and as mystifying, as that in the United States.11
Ends of New Eras and Financial Crises
The sequelae of the extraordinary price increases described in the
previous section were highly variable. They were frequently fol-
lowed by dramatic reversals, but this is by no means always the
case. Do the increases carry the seeds of their own destruction, or
are the interruptions due to other causes?
Often the ends of bull markets appear to be caused by concrete
events unrelated to any irrational exuberance in the stock market.
Notable among these are financial crises, such as banking or
exchange rate crises. These other events then become the focus
ofanalysis, since their causes appear more definite than those of
the stock market crisis. According to such an analysis, the ends
ofthe “new eras” have a narrow technical origin, rather than a psy-
chological or social origin.
The 1994 Mexican crisis appears as the aftermath of the sixth most
spectacular five-year stock price increase in Table 6.3. The anatomy
of this crisis is a complicated one. Analysts stress an investor run
on the peso, followed by investors’ refusal to accept again the
tesobono,the dollar-denominated short-term debt of the Mexican
government. The investing public knew that the Mexican govern-
ment did not have enough dollars in reserve to support the peso

knowledge alone need not have caused a currency devaluation, in
combination with a belief that the devaluation of the peso was immi-
nent, it in fact forced the devaluation. Adevaluation of the peso,
of course, is not itself a bad thing, and in fact it might have been
the boost that the Mexican economy needed. But then there was
the fact that investors mistrusted and decided not to reinvest in the
tesobono debt. Since the Mexican government could not sell new
debt, as its old debt came due it was unable to repay it. Fortunately,
the government was saved by an international loan that enabled
it to make good on this debt after all, and an economic crisis was
resolved.
However, note—despite having identified the source of the prob-
lem as related to the peso, despite the shortness of the Mexican eco-
nomic crisis, and despite the international loans to Mexico to fix
the problem—that the real Mexican stock market was still, as of
mid-1999, 50% below its 1994 peak. The period saw a fundamen-
tal change in the public’s attitude toward the Mexican stock mar-
ket. Before the 1994 crisis, under the Salinas government, with the
advent of the North American Free TradeAgreement and with Mex-
ico’s admission into the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development, there seems to have been an exaggerated “new
era” sense of invulnerability and of a great future ahead for
Mexico, which faded after the crisis.
TheAsian financial crisis of 1997–98 was also much more than
a stock market crisis. It included exchange rate and banking crises,
and again these tended to attract the attention of analysts. But, as
can be seen from Table 6.3, the Asian crisis was preceded by a good
number of the largest five-year price increases, and these came sub-
stantially before the exchange rate and banking crises. Japan had
had a 275.6% five-year real stock price increase fromAugust 1982
toAugust 1987; Hong Kong a 230.9% stock price increase from
October 1982 to October 1987; Korea a 518.3% stock price increase
from March 1984 to March 1989; Taiwan a 468.1% stock price
increase from May 1986 to May 1991; and Thailand a 430.7% stock
price increase over the same period. Most of these price increases
came during the period 1982–87, as the world experienced a recov-
ery from the Great Recession of 1981. In all of these countries, the

130 CULTURAL FACTORS
stock market was already down from its peak by December 1996,
before there was any hint of the Asian financial crisis. It appears
that the collapse of a speculative bubble in these countries preceded
the crisis and was part of the ambience that produced the crisis.
Yet when the crisis finally came, the stock market stories, as well
as stories of public confidence, appeared only vaguely in the back-
ground, as attention centered on changes in currency exchange rates,
the sudden withdrawal of foreign investors, banking problems,
inflation, and labor difficulties.
These financial crisis stories illustrate the complicated factors that
sometimes capture the attention of economic and financial analysts.
Each of them may seem to be “the” technical story that explains
events. Discussions may focus on these factors and pull attention
away from the large changes in public opinion that are reflected
in speculative prices. Therefore the underlying story of investors
overreacting to news and of the feedback of price increases leading
to further price increases often tends to get lost.
What Went Up (Down) Usually Came Back Down (Up)
It is impossible to provethe assertion that some speculative excesses
were behind many of these events. One can always argue that the
fundamental reasons offered by investors to justify them were valid
in terms of the evidence that was available when the market was
going up, and that “new era” stories are never completely with-
out merit as theories of what mighthappen. But one can also ask
whether these price movements have tended to be reversed. If the
price increases are, on average, reversed, then we have some evi-
dence that the fundamental reasons were not sound.
The data on which these tables are based confirm for countries
the result first discovered by Werner De Bondt and Richard Thaler:
that winner stocks—if winner status is measured over long inter-
vals of time such as five years—tend to do poorly in subsequent
intervals of the same length, and that loser stocks—if loser status
is measured over equally long intervals—tend to do well in sub-
sequent intervals of the same length.12

NEW ERAS AND BUBBLES AROUND THE WORLD 131
From the data used to produce the tables, we find that, for the
seventeen countries shown in Table 6.3 for which subsequent five-
year data were available, eleven (65%) experienced a decrease,
onaverage, in real stock prices in the five-year periods after large
five-year real price increases, and the average price change for the
seventeen countries was a decrease of 3.9%.13Similarly, for the six-
teen countries shown in Table 6.4 for which subsequent five-year
data were available, fifteen (94%) experienced an increase in real
stock prices in the five-year periods after large five-year real price
decreases, and the average price change was an increase of 121.9%.
We thus see quite a substantial, though imperfect, tendency for
majorfive-year stock price movements to be reversed in another
five years, for both up movements and down movements.
When we look at one-year real price changes, as in Tables 6.1 and
6.2, we find that the tendency toward reversals is less pronounced,
as we would expect from past literature on prices of individual
stocks. We find that, for the eighteen countries shown in Table 6.1
for which subsequent twelve-month data were available, nine
(50%) experienced a decrease in real stock prices in the twelve-
month periods after large twelve-month price increases, so that the
direction of the change was equally split between up and down,
and the average change was an increase of 11.4%. For the twenty-
one countries shown in Table 6.2, fourteen (67%) experienced an
increase in real stock prices in the twelve-month periods after
large twelve-month decreases, and the average real price change
was an increase of 10.7%. Twelve months does not appear to be
enough time to begin to see a tendency for these extreme price
movements to reverse themselves.
Quite possibly, the tendency for individual countries’ stock
market valuations to grow dramatically and then to be reversed will
diminish in the future. With freer capital movements than were pos-
sible during the periods covered by the examples in the tables, and
with more and more global investors seeking profit opportunities
buying undervalued countries or shorting overvalued countries,
markets may become more stable. Even so, it is unlikely that these
forces will soon eliminate the potential for such movements,

particularly infrequent and slow large-country events or world-
wide events, for which the attendant profit opportunities are slow
and hard to diversify. The possibility of major speculative bubbles,
now and in the future, cannot be ignored.
In this section on cultural factors, we have explored the justifi-
cations people have given, at various points in history, for chang-
ing market valuations, and we have seen evidence of the transitory
nature of these cultural factors. Ultimately, however, the conclu-
sions we draw from such evidence depend on our view of human
nature and the extent of human abilities to produce consistent and
independent judgments. To consolidate our understanding of the
argument, we turn, in the next part, to a study of fundamental psy-
chological factors—human tendencies to act independently or to
acquiesce, to believe others or to disbelieve them, to feel confidence
or self-doubt, to be attentive or inattentive. These tendencies bear
on the plausibility of our view of speculative bubbles.

Seven
Psychological Anchors for the Market
We have seen that the market is
not well anchored by funda-
mentals. People do not even know to any degree of accuracy
what the “right” level of the market is: not many of them spend
much time thinking about what its level should be or whether it
is over- or underpriced today. So what is it that ties down the mar-
ket’s level on any given day? What anchors the market? What is
it that determines whether the Dow Jones Industrial Average is
at4,000 or 14,000? What ultimately limits the feedback from price
changes to further price changes that amplifies speculative price
movements? Why does the market stay within a certain region for
days at a time, only to break out suddenly? We have already seen
some partial answers to these questions, but to understand the true
nature of the anchors at work here, we must also turn to psychology.
In considering lessons from psychology, it must be noted that
many popular accounts of the psychology of investing are simply
not credible. Investors are said to be euphoric or frenzied during
booms or panic-stricken during market crashes. In both booms and
crashes, investors are described as blindly following the herd like
so many sheep, with no minds of their own. Belief in the rationality

136 PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS
of markets starts to sound a lot better when the only alternatives
are such pop-psychological theories.
We all know that most people are more sensible during such
financial episodes than these accounts suggest. Financial booms
and crashes are, for most of us, not emotion-laden events on a par
with victories in battle or volcanic eruptions. In fact, during the most
significant financial events, most people are preoccupied with other
personal matters, not with the financial markets at all. So it is hard
to imagine that the market as a whole reflects the emotions described
by these psychological theories.
However, solid psychological research does show that there are
patterns of human behavior that suggest anchors for the market
that would not be expected if markets worked entirely rationally.
These patterns of human behavior are not the result of extreme
human ignorance, but rather of the character of human intelligence,
reflecting its limitations as well as its strengths. Investors are striv-
ing to do the right thing, but they have limited abilities and cer-
tain natural modes of behavior that decide their actions when an
unambiguous prescription for action is lacking.1
Two kinds of psychological anchors will be considered here:quan-
titative anchors,which themselves give indications for the appro-
priate levels of the market that some people use as indications of
whether the market is over- or underpriced and whether it is a good
time to buy, and moral anchors,which operate by determining the
strength of the reason that compels people to buy stocks, a reason
that they must weigh against their other uses for the wealth they
already have (or could have) invested in the market. With quan-
titative anchors, people are weighing numbers against prices when
they decide whether stocks (or other assets) are priced right. With
moral anchors, people compare the intuitive or emotional strength
of the argument for investing in the market against their wealth
and their perceived need for money to spend now.
Quantitative Anchors for the Market
Designers of questionnaires have learned that the answers people
give can be heavily influenced by suggestions that are given on the

PSYCHOLOGICAL ANCHORS FOR THE MARKET 137
questionnaires themselves. For example, when people are asked
to state within which of a number of ranges their income falls, their
answers are influenced by the ranges given. The ranges serve as
“anchors” to which they make their answers conform.
Psychologists have shown that people’s decisions in ambiguous
situations are influenced by whatever available anchor is at hand.
When you must come up with an estimate, and you are unsure what
to say, you take whatever number is before you. Psychologists Amos
Tversky and Daniel Kahneman demonstrated this tendency clearly
in an experiment involving a wheel of fortune: a large wheel with
the numbers from 1 to 100 on it, similar to those used in television
game shows, that is designed to stop at a random number when
it is spun. Subjects were asked questions whose answers were num-
bers between 1 and 100, difficult questions such as the percentage
ofAfrican nations in the United Nations. They were asked first to
say whether the answer they would give was above or below the
number just produced by the wheel of fortune. Then they were
asked to give their answer. The experimenters found that the answer
was quite substantially influenced by the random number on the
wheel. For example, if the wheel stopped at 10, the median per-
centage of African nations according to their subjects was 25,
whereas if the wheel stopped at 65, the median percentage was 45.
This experiment was particularly interesting because it was designed
so thatthe subject clearly knew that the number produced by the
wheel was purely random and, moreover, because the number
produced by the wheel should have had no emotional significance
for the subject.2
In making judgments about the level of stock prices, the most
likely anchor is the most recently remembered price. The tendency
of investors to use this anchor enforces the similarity of stock prices
from one day to the next. Other possible anchors are remembered
past prices, and the tendency of past prices to serve as anchors may
be part of the reason for the observed tendency for trends in indi-
vidual stock prices to be reversed.Another anchor may be the near-
est milestone of a prominent index such as the Dow, the nearest
round-number level, and investors’ use of this anchor may help
explain unusual market behavior surrounding such levels. Past price

changesmay also provide an anchor, if attention is suitably drawn
to them. Recall from Chapter 4 that the drop in the market in the
October 19, 1987, crash was nearly the same in percentage terms
as that in the October 28–29, 1929, crash that was so much discussed
at the time of the 1987 crash.
For individual stocks, price changes may tend to be anchored
to the price changes of other stocks, and price-earnings ratios may
be anchored to other firms’ price-earnings levels. This kind of
anchoring may help to explain why individual stock prices move
together as much as they do, and thus ultimately why stock price
indexes are as volatile as they are—why the averaging across stocks
that is inherent in the construction of the index doesn’t more
solidly dampen its volatility.3It may also explain why stocks of com-
panies that are in different industries but are headquartered in the
same country tend to have more similar price movements than
stocks of companies that are in the same industry but are head-
quartered in different countries, contrary to one’s expectation that
the industry would define the fundamentals of the company bet-
ter than the location of its headquarters.4And it may explain why
real estate investment trusts traded on stock exchanges tend to
behave more like stocks than like the appraised value of their under-
lying commercial real estate.5Indeed all of these anomalies noted
in financial markets have a simple explanation in terms of quan-
titative anchoring to convenient numbers.
Moral Anchors for the Market
With moral anchoring, the market is tied down by people’s com-
parisons of the intuitive force of stories and reasons to hold their
investments against their perceived need to consume the wealth
that these investments represent. The market is not prevented from
going up to arbitrarily high levels because people have any idea
what its intrinsically “right” level is or what level would be too high.
Rather, if the market were to get too high, the discrepancy between
the wealth many people would then have in the market and their
current living standards would, when compared with their reasons
for holding stocks, encourage them to sell. One can appreciate the

nature of this anchor with an extreme example. Suppose, counter-
factually, that the psychology of the market caused the level of the
stock market to rise so as to make most holders of stocks multi-
millionaires—on paper. Then, unless the reason these people have
to continue holding every single share is perceived to be extremely
strong, they would want to start living a little more like multi-
millionaires and sell some of their stocks to be able to spend the
money. Such selling would obviously bring stock prices down, since
there would be no buyers, and obviously there just isn’t sufficient
current national income available to sustain anything like this
many multimillionaires. The stock market can reach fantastic levels
only if people think that they have good reasons not to test it by
trying to enjoy their newfound wealth.
Underlying this notion of moral anchors is the psychological prin-
ciple that much of the human thinking that results in action is not
quantitative, but instead takes the form of storytellingandjustifica-
tion.That is why, in the case of moral anchors, people are weigh-
ing a story, which has no quantitative dimension, against the
observed quantity of financial wealth that they have available for
consumption. Such reasoning is not well described by the usual kind
of economic theory, but there is a large amount of evidence in sup-
port of the assertion that investor reasoning does take this form.
Psychologists Nancy Pennington and Reid Hastie have shown
the importance of stories in decision making by studying how jurors
reached decisions in difficult cases. They found that jurors’ approach
to reasoning through the complicated issues of the trial tended to
take the form of constructing a story, filling out the details that were
provided to them about the case into a coherent narrative of the
chain of events. In describing their verdict, they tended not to speak
of quantities or probabilities, or of summing up the weight of the
evidence, but rather merely to tell a story of the case, typically a
chronology of events, and to remark how well their story fit together
and how internally consistent it was.6
By analogy, those who sell stocks to the general public often tend
to tell a story about the stock, a vivid story describing the history
of the company, the nature of the product, and how the public is using
the product. The sales call does not as often engage in discussions

of quantities or probabilities, or of whether the price is at the
right level in terms of quantitative evidence about future dividends
or earnings. These quantitative factors are not as congenial to the
narrative-based decision making that comes naturally to people.
There is a basic human interest in gambling, seen in one form
or another in all cultures,7an interest that also expresses itself in
speculative markets. Some of the attraction to gambling, despite
odds that are often openly stacked against gamblers, apparently
has to do with narrative-based thinking. When gamblers are heard
talking, they are usually telling stories, not evaluating probabili-
ties, and the possibilities suggested by the stories often seem to have
more substantive reality than any quantitative concepts. In these
stories, gamblers use a different vocabulary than do probability the-
orists, preferring the words luck or lucky day, and rarely uttering
the wordsprobabilityorlikelihood.There are stories of their winnings
and losses, of the chains of events that preceded their best or worst
luck, of the strength of their intuition that yielded good bets. These
stories can convey a sense of meaning and significance to events
that are in fact purely random.8
It has been noted that employees have a tendency to invest in
company stock (that is, stock issued by the firm that employs them),
even though it would appear to be more in their interest to diver-
sify away from the source of their own livelihood. About a third
of assets in large retirement savings plans are invested in company
stock, and in some companies, such as Coca-Cola, company stock
reaches 90% of assets.9This tendency to invest in company stock
can be interpreted as consistent with investors’ being influenced
by stories: they know many more stories about their own companies
and so invest in those companies’ stocks.
People also appear to want to construct simple reasons for their
decisions, as if they feel the need to justify those decisions in simple
terms—if not to others, then to themselves. The need to have a
simple reason to explain a decision is similar to the need to have
a story behind a decision; both the stories and the reasons are simple
rationales that can be conveyed verbally to others.
Psychologists Eldar Shafir, Itamar Simonson, and Amos Tversky
demonstrated experimentally an effect that appears to represent

decision biases caused by people’s search for simple reasons to jus-
tify decisions. They presented their subjects with a simple choice
between two options: one option was “impoverished,” with no
striking positive or negative features. The other was “enriched,”
displaying both distinctly positive and distinctly negative features.
In one of their experiments, subjects were asked to choose to
which parent they would award sole custody of a child. ParentA,
the impoverished option, was described with the words “average
income, average health, average working hours, reasonable rap-
port with the child, and relatively stable social life.” Parent B, the
enriched option, was described with the words “above-average
income, very close relationship with the child, extremely active
social life, lots of work-related travel, minor health problems.” The
experimenters found that the subjects’ choices depended on how
they were asked about the two choices. When a group of subjects
was asked to select the parent to whom they would award custody,
64% chose Parent B. When a second group was asked to pick the
parent to whom they would deny custody, 55% again chose Par-
ent B. The predominant answers given by the two groups arelog-
ically inconsistent, but they are consistent with a feeling that one
must have a solid reason to justify a decision. The psychologists
found that the same tendency occurs even for purely personal deci-
sions that will never need to be explained to others.10
Reasons to hold stocks or other investments can take on ethical
as well as practical dimensions. Our culture may supply reasons
to hold stocks and other savings vehicles that are related to our sense
of identity as responsible people, as good or levelheaded people.
The Millionaire Next Door,a best-seller since 1996, makes the point
that most millionaires in the United States are not exceptional
income earners, but merely frugal savers: average folks who are
not enticed by a new car every year, an extravagant house, or other
such money pits.11This book is not only an interesting study of
millionaires; it also projects a subtle message suggesting the moral
superiority of those who hold and gradually accumulate wealth
over a lifetime. It therefore provides an attractive reason to save
and invest. The book offers no analyses of price-earnings ratios
oranything remotely like specific investment advice, thus subtly

reinforcing the impression that these are irrelevant. Instead, it
offers lots of stories of successful, frugal people, many of whom
prospered during the recent bull market—stories with vivid details
and great immediacy for readers. The book’s enticing story about
investing millionaires who do not test the market by trying to cash
out and consume their wealth is just the kind of moral anchor
needed to help sustain an unusual bull market.
Overconfidence and Intuitive Judgment
In judging the significance of these psychological anchors for the
market, it is important to bear in mind that there appears to be a
pervasive human tendency towardoverconfidencein one’s beliefs.
People are ready to act on stories or reasons that one might think
they should have little confidence in.
People think they know more than they do. They like to express
opinions on matters they know little about, and they often act on
these opinions. We have all observed at one time or another that
there are a lot of know-it-alls out there. But psychologists have
described the tendency toward overconfidence with some care and
indications of its generality.
Psychologists Baruch Fischhof, Paul Slovic, and Sarah Lichten-
stein showed that if people are asked simple factual questions (such
as which of two popular magazines has the higher circulation or
which of two common causes of death is the more frequent) and
are then asked to give the probability that their answer is right, they
tend to overestimate the probability that they are right. In fact, when
people said they were certain they were right they were in fact right
only about 80% of the time.12
This result has been the subject of controversy among psychol-
ogists, and the overconfidence phenomenon has not been found
to be universal. It has been shown that people can sometimes be
trained out of their overconfidence in the experimental setting.13
Yet some basic tendency toward overconfidence appears to be a
robust human character trait: the bias is definitely toward over-
confidence rather than underconfidence. I find that overconfidence
is apparent when I interview investors; they seem to express
overly strong opinions and rush to summary judgments.

==================================================

PSYCHOLOGICAL ANCHORS FOR THE MARKET 143
Psychologists have long wondered why it is that people seem to
be overconfident. One theory has been that, in evaluating the sound-
ness of their conclusions, people tend to evaluate the probability that
they are right on only the last step of their reasoning, forgetting how
many other elements of their reasoning could be wrong.14Another
theory is that people make probability judgments by looking for
similarities to other known observations, and they forget that there
are many other possible observations with which they could com-
pare.15The reason for overconfidence may also have to do with hind-
sight bias, a tendency to think that one would have known actual
events were coming before they happened, had one been present
thenor had reason to pay attention.16Hindsight bias encourages a
view of the world as more predictable than it really is.
Another factor in overconfidence as it relates to speculative
markets is magical thinking.When we speak of people’s intuition
about the likelihood that investments will do well or poorly and
their own decisions to invest, we are speaking of their innermost
thoughts—thoughts that they do not have to explain or justify to
others. Patterns of thought referred to as “magical thinking” or
“quasi-magical thinking” by psychologists are likely to play a role.
People have occasional feelings that certain actions will make them
lucky even if they know logically that the actions cannot have an
effect on their fortunes.
People will make serious decisions based on thinking that they
would, if pressed, admit was illogical. It has been shown that people
will place larger bets on a coin that has not yet been tossed than
on a coin that has already been tossed (and for which the outcome
has been concealed). And people will, if asked how much money
they would demand to part with a lottery ticket they already hold,
give a figure over four times greater if they themselves chose the
lottery number on the ticket. Apparently, at some magical level
people think that they can influence a coin that has not yet been
tossed and influence the likelihood of winning the lottery by choos-
ing the number.17
Based on such experimental results, it seems clear that people
are capable of thinking, at least at some intuitive level, “If I buy a
stock, then it will go up afterwards” or “If I buy a stock, then others
will probably want to buy the stock, too, because they are like me”

144 PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS
or “I have a hot hand lately; my luck is with me.” Such thinking
is likely, in a subtle way, to contribute to the overconfidence that
may help the propagation of speculative bubbles.
Another aspect of overconfidence is that people tend to make
judgments in uncertain situations by looking for familiar patterns
and assuming that future patterns will resemble past ones, often
without sufficient consideration of the reasons for the pattern
orthe probability of the pattern repeating itself. This anomaly of
human judgment, called the representativeness heuristic,was demon-
strated in a number of experiments by psychologists Tversky and
Kahneman.
For example, these researchers asked people to guess the occu-
pation, from a list of occupations, of people with a given personal-
ity description. If the description given was that the person was artistic
and sensitive, they tended to choose conductor or sculptress, rather
than laborer or secretary, disregarding entirely the fact that the for-
mer occupations are extremely rare and thus that the answers are
much less likely to be right.18It would be wiser, in answering such
questions, almost never to guess the occupation conductor or sculp-
tress, since the base rate probabilities are so low. But people look for
the best-fit occupation, disregarding the base rate probabilities.
Economists Nicholas Barberis, Andrei Shleifer, and Robert Vishny
have developed the representativeness heuristic into a theory of
investors’ selective overconfidence and into a psychological theory
of an expectational feedback loop. These authors argue that
investors, when they see stock prices move in the same direction
for a while, gradually begin to assume that the trend is represen-
tative of many trends that they have seen in other economic data.
According to a psychological principle of conservatism, people
areslow to change their opinions. For this reason, it takes some time
before investors begin to conclude that the trend will continue. The
interplay between the representativeness heuristic and the prin-
ciple of conservatism determines the speed at which the specula-
tive feedback progresses.19
Overconfidence, however generated, appears to be a funda-
mentalfactor promoting the high volume of trade we observe in
speculative markets. Without such overconfidence, one would

think that there would be little trading in financial markets. If people
were completely rational, then half the investors should think that
they are below average in their trading ability and should there-
fore be unwilling to do speculative trades with the other half, who
they think will probably dominate them in trading. Thus the above-
average half would have no one to trade with, and there should
ideally be no trading for speculative reasons.20
Overconfidence in judgments can at times influence people to
believe that they know when a market move will take place, even
if they generally believe as an intellectual matter that stock prices
are not forecastable. In the survey that I carried out of investors
right after the crash of October 19, 1987, I asked them, “Did you
think at any point on October 19, 1987, that you had a pretty good
idea when a rebound was to occur?” Of individual investors who
had bought on that day, 47.1% said yes; of institutional investors,
47.9% said yes. Thus nearly half of those trading that day thought
they knew what the market would do that day. I find this remark-
able. Even among all individual investors, most of whom did not
buy or sell at all on that day, 29.2% answered yes to this question;
among all institutional investors, 28.0% answered yes.
Why would anyone think that they knew what the market would
do on any given day, and especially on such a tumultuous day?
The idea that one would know such things stands contrary to the
most elementary observations about markets’ forecastability, and
contrary to the conventional wisdom that accurate market timing
is very difficult. Quite a few people apparently do not consistently
believe that the market is never very forecastable.
The next question on the questionnaire was, “If yes, what made
you think you knew when a rebound would occur?” There was a
striking absence of solid grounding for the answers. References were
made to “intuition,” “gut feeling,” “historical evidence and com-
mon sense,” or “market psychology.” Mentions of concrete facts
or references to explicit theories were rare, even among the insti-
tutional investors.
These intuitive feelings about the future course of the market
were extremely important for the course of the stock market crash,
for apparently it was these intuitive judgments that set the anchors

that stopped the price decline. To understand speculative bubbles,
positive or negative, we must appreciate that overconfidence in
one’s own intuitive judgments plays a fundamental role.
The Fragility of Anchors: Difficulty Thinking
Ahead to Contingent Future Decisions
The anchors discussed here account for the stability of the market
from day to day, but we must also account for the ability of these
anchors to let loose occasionally—sometimes suddenly. Markets
do make dramatic shifts. Part of the reason for the surprises the
market hands us from time to time is that news events have an effect
on people’s reasons that even they could not have expected.
Psychologists Shafir and Tversky have described a phenomenon
they call nonconsequentialist reasoning:reasoning that is character-
ized by an inability to think through the elementary conclusions
one would draw in the future if hypothetical events were to occur.
According to Shafir and Tversky, people cannot decide until the
events actually occur. When we learn to play games of logic, for
example chess, we must practice thinking ahead to the decisions
we will make in the future in response to the other player’s deci-
sions. One learns to think, “If I move here, then she might move
either here or there, and if she moves here I will be fine, but if she
moves there I will be faced with a difficult situation... .” That is,
one learns to think through the ramifications of all relevant
branches of a decision tree. In everyday life we to some extent prac-
tice the same modes of thinking that we learned in playing these
games. But real-world decisions are clouded by emotions and a lack
of clearly defined objectives, and people do not generally behave
as if they have thought things through well in advance.
Shafir and Tversky give an example of students’ decision mak-
ing about whether to take a vacation in Hawaii after learning
whether they had passed or failed an important exam. Faced with
such a choice, they look into their own minds for their feelings about
the choice. Some students who have passed the exam will think,
“I should take the vacation as a celebration and a reward.” Some
students who have failed the exam will think, “I should take the

vacation as a consolation, to improve my mood after having
failed.” Some students will decide to take a vacation whether or
not they pass the exam. Those students who would take the vaca-
tion in either case should be able, if they were fully logical, to book
the vacation well in advance of the exam, knowing that the infor-
mation about the outcome of the exam is not really relevant to their
decision. But these people sometimes have great difficulty making
such a choice before they know the outcome of the exam. Before
the exam, they cannot fully anticipate the emotional reason for tak-
ing the vacation, and so they cannot feel good about committing
themselves to it.21
Although this example presents a situation in which the diffi-
culty people face is in deciding how they themselves will feel in
the future, rather than in deciding on questions of simple fact as
in the game of chess, in reality decisions about investments are likely
to have as much of an emotional component as decisions about
whether to go on a vacation.
For this reason, the effects of news stories on the stock market
sometimes have more to do with discovery of how we feelabout
the news than with any logical reaction to the news. We can make
decisions then that would have been impossible before the news
was known. It is partly for this reason that the breaking off of a psy-
chological anchor can be so unpredictable: people discover things
about themselves, about their own emotions and inclinations, only
afterprice changes occur.
Psychological anchors for the market hook themselves on the
strangest things along the muddy bottom of our consciousness. The
anchor can skip and drag, only to snag again on some object whose
strength would surprise us if we saw it at the surface. We have con-
sidered in this chapter some of the psychological factors that
explain the nature of such anchors. But the anchors can have
significance for the market as a whole only if the same thoughts
enter the minds of many. In the next chapter, we turn to the social
basis of thinking: the tendencies toward herd behavior and the
contagion of ideas.

Herd Behavior and Epidemics
Afundamental observation about
human society is that people
who communicate regularly with one another think similarly.
There is at any place and in any time a Zeitgeist,a spirit of the times.
It is important to understand the origins of this similar thinking,
so that we can judge the plausibility of theories of speculative
fluctuations that ascribe price changes to faulty thinking. If the mil-
lions of people who invest were all truly independent of each
other, any faulty thinking would tend to average out, and such think-
ing would have no effect on prices. But if less-than-mechanisticor
irrational thinking is in fact similar over large numbers of people,
then such thinking can indeed be the source of stock market
booms and busts.
Part of the reason people’s judgments are similar at similar
times is that they are reacting to the same information—the infor-
mation that was publicly available at that time. But, as we shall see
in this chapter, rational response to public information is not the
only reason that people think similarly, nor is the use of that pub-
lic information always appropriate or well reasoned.

HERD BEHAVIOR AND EPIDEMICS 149
Social Influence and Information
Acclaimed social psychologist Solomon Asch reported an exper-
iment in 1952 that he interpreted—and that was widely interpreted
by others—as showing the immense power of social pressure on
individual judgment. His paper was published at a time of wide-
spread public concern with the effects of Communist propaganda,
alarm at the apparently successful brainwashing techniques of
Chinese Communists, and continuing puzzlement over the abil-
ity of the Nazis in Germany to obtain an obedient responsewhen
ordering mass exterminations of Jews and other “undesirables.”
Asch’s findings were widely cited in the media as providing a
scientific basis for claims that people do not have fully inde-
pendent judgment. His results are still cited today; those who
found serious flaws in his interpretation of those results are not
nearly as well remembered.
In his famous experiment, Asch placed the subject into a group
of seven to nine other people who were, unbeknownst to the sub-
ject, confederates who had been coached by Asch. The entire group
was asked to answer a sequence of twelve questions about the
lengths of line segments shown to them on cards, and the subject
would hear most of the others’ answers before giving his own
answer before the group. The correct answers to the questions were
obvious, but the confederates deliberately gave wrong answers
to seven of the twelve questions. Faced with a group of people
who were unanimously giving what seemed to be obviously wrong
answers to the questions, a third of the time the subjects caved in
and gave the same wrong answers as had been given by the con-
federates. Furthermore the subjects often showed signs of anxiety
or distress, suggesting that fear of being seen as different or fool-
ish before the group had swayed their judgment.1
Asch explained his results as due to social pressure. There is prob-
ably some validity to this interpretation, but it turns out that the
subjects’ wrong answers were not primarily due to such pressure.
Three years after Asch published his findings, psychologists
Morton Deutsch and Harold Gerard reported a variant of Asch’s



==================================================
                     PAGE 173                     
==================================================

150 PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS
experiment in which the subjects were told that they had been
placedanonymouslyinto a group of people, people that they never
saw and never would see, and whose answers they could observe
only indirectly through an electronic signal. (In fact there was really
no group at all.) Subjects could give their answers to the questions
merely by pressing a button, unobserved by others, so that there
was no need to stand up to a group face to face. Otherwise, the
experiment proceeded as it had under Asch.And the subjects gave
nearly as many wrong answers as they had before.2
Deutsch and Gerard concluded that the wrong answers in the
Asch experiment had been given in large part because people
simply thought that all the other people could not be wrong. They
were reacting to the information that a large group of people had
reached a judgment different from theirs,rather than merely the fear
of expressing a contrary opinion in front of a group. This behav-
ior is a matter of rational calculation: in everyday living we have
learned that when a large group of people is unanimous in its judg-
ment on a question of simple fact, the members of that group are
almost certainly right. The anxiety and distress that Asch’s subjects
expressed may have come partly from their conclusion that their
own senses were somehow not reliable.
Another widely cited series of experiments relevant to herd
behavior is Stanley Milgram’s investigations of the power of author-
ity. In Milgram’s experiments, the subject was asked to adminis-
ter electric shocks to another person sitting close by, who was, again
unbeknownst to the subject, a confederate. There really were no
electric shocks, but the confederate pretended to be experiencing
them, feigning pain and suffering. The confederate asserted that
he was in great distress and asked that the experiment be stopped.
But when the experimenter told the subjects to continue admin-
istering the shocks, insisting that the shocks would cause no per-
manent tissue damage, many did so.3
These results were widely interpreted as demonstrating the
enormous power of authority over the human mind. Indeed the
results may be understood partly on those terms. But there is
another interpretation: that people have learned that when experts
tell them something is all right, it probably is, even if it does not

HERD BEHAVIOR AND EPIDEMICS 151
seem so. (In fact, it is worth noting that in this case the experi-
menterwas indeed correct: it wasall right to continue giving the
“shocks”—even though most of the subjects did not suspect the rea-
son.) Thus the results of Milgram’s experiment can also be inter-
preted as springing from people’s past learning about the reliability
of authorities.4
Asch’s and Milgram’s studies are as interesting as ever when
viewed from the standpoint of this information-based interpreta-
tion. The experiments demonstrate that people are ready to believe
the majority view or to believe authorities even when they plainly
contradict matter-of-fact judgment. And their behavior is in fact
largely rational and intelligent. Most people have had many prior
experiences of making errors when they contradicted the judgments
of a larger group or of an authority figure, and they have learned
from these experiences. Thus the Asch and Milgram experiments
give us a different perspective on the overconfidence phenomenon:
people are respectful of authorities in formulating the opinions
about which they will later be so overconfident, transferring their
confidence in authorities to their own judgments based upon
them.
Given the kind of behavior observed by Asch and Milgram, it
is not at all surprising that many people are accepting of the per-
ceived authority of others on such matters as stock market valua-
tion. Most must certainly trust their own judgment in this area even
less than the experimental subjects trusted the evidence of their own
eyes about the lengths of lines on cards or the pain and suffering
that a person sitting next to them was experiencing.
Economic Theories of Herd Behavior
and Information Cascades
Even completely rational people can participate in herd behavior
when they take into account the judgments of others, and even if
they know that everyone else is behaving in a herdlike manner. The
behavior, although individually rational, produces group behavior
that is, in a well-defined sense, irrational. This herdlike behavior
is said to arise from an information cascade.5

==================================================

152 PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS
Asimple story will illustrate how such an information cascade
could get started. Suppose two restaurants open next door to each
other. Each potential customer must choose between the two.
Would-be customers may be able to make some judgments about
the quality of each of the restaurants when viewing it through the
front window, but such judgments will not be very accurate. The first
customer who arrives must choose based only on viewing the two
empty restaurants and makes a choice. However, the next potential
customer can rely not only on his or her own information, based
onthe appearance of the restaurants, but also—by seeing the first
customer eating in one or the other of the restaurants—informa-
tion about the choice made by the first customer. If the second cus-
tomer chooses to go to the same restaurant as the first, the third
customer will see two people eating in that restaurant. The end
result may be that all customers may wind up eating at the same
restaurant—and it could well be the poorer restaurant, since there
was no real consideration of the combined evidence inherent in all
their observations about the two restaurants. If all of them had been
able to pool their first impressions and discuss these as a group,
they might have been able to deduce which restaurant was likely
to be the better one. But in this scenario they cannot make use of
each other’s information, since they do not reveal their own infor-
mation to others when they merely follow them.
The restaurant story, and the economic theory that underlies it,
is not in itself a theory of stock market bubbles. However, it has
clear relevance to stock market behavior, and it can provide a
foundation for a theory about how rational investors may be led
astray.6According to such a theory, the popular notion that the level
of market prices is the outcome of a sort of vote by all investors
about the true value of the market is just plain wrong. Hardly any-
one is really voting. Instead people are rationally choosing not to,
as they see it, waste their time and effort in exercising their judgment
about the market, and thus choosing not to exert any independent
impact on the market. Ultimately, all such information cascade
theories are theories of the failure of information about true fundamental
value to be disseminated and evaluated.
It is important to emphasize that this failure to disseminate infor-
mation to others can be modeled in economic theory in terms of

purely rational behavior with no limitations of intelligence, only
limitations of revealed information. But to achieve a better under-
standing of the issues relevant to financial market mispricing, one
must also understand some parameters of human behavior, of
limitations of human information processing, that are relevant to
the transmission of information and the potential for speculative
bubbles.
Human Information Processing and Word of Mouth
The human mind is the product of evolution almost entirely in the
absence of the printed word, e-mail, the Internet, or any other arti-
ficial means of communication. Human society has been able to
conquer almost all habitats of this planet primarily because of its
own innate information processing ability.Afundamental com-
ponent of this information processing ability is effective commu-
nication of important facts from one person to another.
This superior ability to communicate knowledge has been
made possible over the past few million years by evolutionary
changes within the human brain that have optimized the chan-
nels of communication and created an emotional drive to com-
municate effectively. It is because of this emotional drive that
most people’s favorite activity is conversation. Look around you.
Everywhere you go, when two or more people are not working
or playing or sleeping (and, in some cases, even when they are
doing these things), they are talking. The incessant exchange of
information is a fundamental characteristic of our species. The infor-
mation that tends to flow most rapidly is the kind that would have
helped society in centuries past in its everyday living: information
about such things as food sources, dangers, or other members of
society.
For this reason, in modern society there is likely to be rapidly
spreading conversation about a buying opportunity for a hot
stock, or about immediate threats to personal wealth, or about the
story of the people who run a company. These topics resemble the
kinds of things our ancestors have talked about since time immemo-
rial. But conversation seems to flow less well about abstract topics,
such as the mathematics of finance, or statistics about asset returns,

or optimal levels of saving for retirement. Transmission of such
knowledge is of course effortful, infrequent, and imperfect.
Face-to-Face Communications
versus Media Communications
The conventional media—print media, television, and radio—have
a profound capability for spreading ideas, but their ability to
generate active behaviors is still limited. Interpersonal and inter-
active communications, particularly face-to-face or word-of-mouth
communications, still have the most powerful impact on our
behavior.
In a 1986 study of individual investors, John Pound and I sought
to determine how their attention was first drawn to a stock. We
mailed a questionnaire to a random sample of individual investors
and asked them to consider the company whose stock they had pur-
chased most recently. We asked, “What first drew your attention
to the company?” Only 6% specified periodicals or newspapers.
The majority of the answers named sources that would involve
direct interpersonal communication.7Even if people read a lot, their
attention and actions appear to be more stimulated by interpersonal
communications.
The power of interpersonal, word-of-mouth communication
about investments has been amply illustrated by the work of the
market surveillance units at the exchanges and within the Secu-
rities and Exchange Commission. Their brief is to detect insider trad-
ing, and to that end they carefully follow the trail of communications
among individual investors. Court documents reveal, for example,
that a sequence of word-of-mouth communications was touched
off in May 1995, when a secretary at IBM was asked to photocopy
documents that included references to IBM’s top-secret takeover of
Lotus Development Corporation, a deal scheduled to be announced
on June 5 of that year. She apparently told only her husband, a
beeper salesman. On June 2, he told another person, a co-worker,
who bought shares eighteen minutes later, and another friend, a
computer technician, who initiated a sequence of phone calls. By
the time of the June 5 announcement, twenty-five people con-

nected to this core group had spent half a million dollars on the
investment based on this tip. They included a pizza chef, an elec-
trical engineer, a bank executive, a dairy wholesaler, a former
schoolteacher, a gynecologist, an attorney, and four stockbrokers.8
Clearly word-of-mouth communication can proceed with great
speedand across disparate social groups.
Word-of-mouth transmission of ideas appears to be an important
contributor to day-to-day or hour-to-hour stock market fluctuations,
even though direct word-of-mouth transmission cannot proceed
across the nation quite as fast as markets move. In the questionnaire
survey of investors that I sent out during the week of the stock mar-
ket crash of 1987 (described in detail in Chapter 4), I asked them about
word-of-mouth communications. Of the individual investor respon-
dents, 81.6% said that they had learned of the crash before 5 P.M. on
the same day. Thus they had learned of the crash from sources other
than the next day’s morning newspaper or that day’s evening
news. The average time of day that these investors heard of the crash
was 1:56 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT). For institutional investors,
the average time that they heard of the crash was 10:32 A.M. EDT.
Individual investors reported talking on average to 7.4 other people
about the market situation on the day of the crash; institutional
investors reported talking on average to 19.7 other people.
The channels of human communication that we know today
seem to favor the interpersonal face-to-face and word-of-mouth
communication that developed over millions of years of evolution,
during times when such communication was virtually the only form
of interpersonal communication. The patterns of communication
hard-wired into our brains rely on there being another person’s
voice, another person’s facial expressions, another person’s emo-
tions, and an associated environment of trust, loyalty, and coop-
eration. Because these elements are missing from the written or
electronic word, people find it somewhat more difficult to react to
these sources of information. They cannot give these other sources
the same emotional weight, nor can they remember or use information
from these other sources as well. This is an important reason why
we still have teachers—why we cannot tell our children to simply
sit down and read books or rely on computer-aided instruction.

It is also for this reason that television is such a powerful medium,
in that it mimics much of the appearance of direct interpersonal
conversation. Watching television simulates the very action—the
voices, faces, and emotions—that we experience in conversation.
Indeed, television advertisers often recreate images of everyday
conversation about their products. But television today is still not
interactive; the communication it offers is only one-way, and so it
is still not as effective as direct person-to-person communication.
The telephone, invented well over a hundred years ago, may
still be the most important artificial medium for interpersonal
communication today, because it so closely simulates face-to-face
communications, lacking only the visual stimuli. Studies by soci-
ologists and communications researchers have found that telephone
conversations come very close to face-to-face communications in
information transmission and problem-solving functions, though
they still fall somewhat short in conflict-resolution and person-
perception functions.9
The impact of the telephone appears to have been a factor behind
the volatile stock market of the 1920s. Although the telephone
wasinvented in 1876, it did not become economical, effective, and
widely used until a number of improvements had been made, such
as the invention in 1915 of vacuum tube amplification of longer-
distance telephone calls. By the mid-1920s the average person was
making over two hundred telephone calls per year in the United
States. The 1920s saw the spread of “boiler rooms” and “bucket
shops” that actively sold stocks to the public using the telephone,
employing questionable tactics that easily slipped past ineffective
“blue-sky” legislation at the level of the states. The proliferation
of telephones undoubtedly made it easier to sell stocks to the pub-
lic, and the resulting impetus to fraud helped bring the country to
the point of enacting the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities
ExchangeAct of 1934, which created the Securities and Exchange
Commission.10
Today we are witnessing another explosion of technological
innovations that facilitate interpersonal communication, consist-
ing of e-mail, chat rooms, and interactive Web sites. These new and

effective media for interactive (if not face-to-face) communication
may have the effect of expanding yet again the interpersonal con-
tagion of ideas. They may have allowed enthusiasm for the market
to spread much more widely in the 1990s than it would otherwise
have. Certainly we are still learning how to regulate the use of these
new media in the public interest.
Although e-mail and chat rooms are significant changes in the
technology of communications, it is not clear that their advent is more
significant than that of the telephone many decades ago. Because
the telephone allows communication of emotions as expressed
vocally, it may yet be a better simulator of effective communication
than e-mail or chat rooms in their usual configuration.
Continued technological progress in those computer-based
communications media that allow better simulation of face-to-face
communication will undoubtedly make the transmissibility of ideas
more effective in the future. For example, according to the market
research firm International Data Corporation, desktop and compact
videoconferencing systems, which allow users to see the faces of
others during a conversation over a distance, are just now becom-
ing economical enough for wide use; the installed baseworldwide
is expected to climb from 622,000 endpoints in 1998 to 4.2 million
by 2003.11
Epidemic Models Applied to
Word-of-Mouth Communication
The mathematical theory of the spread of disease has been used
by epidemiologists to predict the course of infection and mortal-
ity.12 These models can be used to better understand the trans-
mission of attitudes and the nature of the feedback mechanism
supporting speculative bubbles.
In the simplest epidemic model, it is assumed that the disease
has a given infection rate(the rate at which the disease spreads from
contagious people to susceptible people) and a given removal rate
(the rate at which infected people become no longer contagious,
through recovery or death).



==================================================
                     PAGE 181                     
==================================================

158 PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS
If the removal rate is zero, the graphical plot of the number of
infected people after the introduction of one contagious person fol-
lows a mathematical curve called the logistic curve.13 With the
logistic curve, the percent of the population that is infected rises
initially at the infection rate. Although the rate of increase is nearly
constant at first, the absolute number of people recorded as
contracting the disease rises faster and faster: as more and more
people become contagious, more and more people become infected
and are seen in doctors’ offices complaining of the first symptoms
of the disease. But the rate of increase starts to decline as the pool
of yet-to-be-infected susceptibles begins to be depleted. Even
though the intrinsic infection rate of the disease is unchanged, the
rate at which new infected people are being produced declines
because those who are infected meet fewer people who have yet
to become infected. Eventually the entire population is infected and
the logistic curve becomes flat, at 100%; then of course there are
no new cases.
If the removal rate is greater than zero, but less than the infec-
tion rate, the model predicts instead that the course of the epidemic
will be bell shaped: the number of infectives will at first rise from
zero, peak, and then drop back to zero. The peak can occur before
100% of the population is ever infected.
If the removal rate is greater than the infection rate, then the epi-
demic will never get started and never even be observed.
Epidemiologists use these models constructively to understand
the pattern of disease outbreaks. Using such models they can infer,
for example, that if the removal rate is just above the infection rate,
then a nearly healthy population is in danger of an epidemic, for
any small uptick in the infection rate or downtick in the removal
rate can tip the balance toward a new epidemic. Thus epidemiol-
ogists can infer that a change in weather patterns that will tend to
keep people indoors together (where they are more likely to infect
each other) may cause the infection rate to increase above the
removal rate. The epidemic will then begin, but the absolute num-
ber of infectives will grow slowly at first. If, in this example, the
weather changes fairly soon again in such a way that the infection
rate is brought back down, so that the number of infectives never

becomes very large, then the epidemic will fail to be noticed by the
general public. But if the bad weather lingers long enough relative
to the difference between the bad-weather-infection rate and the
removal rate, then the epidemic will become large and noticeable
in the population at large. Epidemiologists can use this model to
predict,according to this example, how long a spell of bad weather
is necessary to produce a serious epidemic.
The same kind of epidemic models have been applied to other
biological phenomena that may have relevance to financial mar-
kets. Economist Alan Kirman has used them to model the behav-
ior of ants in exploiting food sources, and he notes that the models
also seem relevant to stock market price changes.14It has been found
experimentally that ants, when presented with two identical food
sources near their nest, tend to exploit both sources, but one more
intensively than another. Over time (and as the experimenter con-
stantly replenishes the food sources so that they remain exactly
equal), the primary attention of the ants may switch from one source
to the other. Why should they not exploit the two equally, and what
causes them to switch their attention? Kirman notes that ants
individually recruit other ants to food sources; there is no central
direction for the nest as a whole. Recruitment is done by contact
and following (tandem recruitment) or by laying a chemical trail
(pheromone recruitment). Both of these processes are the ant
equivalent of word-of-mouth communication. Kirman shows that
if there is randomness in the recruitment process, the experimen-
tally observed phenomena can be explained in terms of a simple
epidemic model.
Although disease spread and ant behavior are of theoretical
interest in our consideration of stock market bubbles, of greatest
practical relevance is the fact that epidemic models have been
applied by sociologists to predict the course of word-of-mouth trans-
mission of ideas.15The dynamics of such transmission may mimic
that of disease. The formal mathematical theory of epidemics
appears, however, to be less accurate for modeling social processes
than for modeling disease spread or ant behavior, and it has yet
to spawn an influential and successful literature by social scien-
tists. This lack of success may be explained by the fact that the basic

160 PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS
parameters of these models are not as constant in the social sciences
as in biological applications.
One reason for the lack of success in applying epidemic models
to the spread of ideas may be that the mutation rate, the rate of trans-
mission errors, is much higher for ideas than for disease or other bio-
logical processes. Many of us recall the children’s game of telephone,
in which the first person selects a simple story and whispers it into
the ear of the second person, who then whispers it into the ear of
the third, and so on. When the story is finally told to the group by
the last person in the chain, the distortion of the original story is
often so dramatic as to provoke laughter. The person-to-person
transmission of stories of any complexity is just not very reliable.
For this reason, pure word-of-mouth transmission of ideas,
even if abetted by the telephone, is not likely to extend widely
enough to infect an entire nation all by itself. The accuracy of trans-
mission will falter long before that happens. In contrast, computer-
to-computer transmission is unerring. Computer viruses can
spread nationally and internationally with no alteration whatso-
ever. But viruses do not have the ability to change people’s think-
ing; they do not get beyond the machine. The ability of users of
e-mail to forward others’ messages or to provide Web links effec-
tively permits word of mouth to spread unerringly. And new
technology that makes it possible and natural to forward word-of-
mouth messages from others as part of a telephone conversation
or a video conference would again dramatically improve the accu-
racy and persistence of interpersonal communications.
Although the imprecision and variability of interpersonal com-
munications as they currently occur prevent formal mathematics
from predicting with any reliability how ideas spread, epidemic
models are still helpful in understanding the kinds of things that
can bring about changes in market prices. For example, it is use-
ful to consider that any change in the infection rate or removal rate
will change the rate of spread of new ideas.
Thus, for example, a major national news story unrelated to
financial markets may lower the infection rate of ideas related to
speculative markets by deflecting attention from them. This phe-

nomenon may help explain why, as noted in Chapter 4, stock
price movements are not notoriously volatile at times of national
crisis despite the potential importance of such crises for the nation’s
businesses and why most large stock market movements occur
when there is not much other news. On the other hand, national
news that ties in with or encourages discussion of the stock mar-
ket may raise the infection rate. This may be part of the explana-
tion for the Internet’s apparently exaggerated effect on the stock
market: attention being paid to the Net promotes conversation about
technology stocks in general, thereby raising the infection rate for
theories about these stocks.
The word-of-mouth transmission of ideas does not have to
infect the entire nation to affect national stock prices. Moreover,
word of mouth may function to amplify public reaction to news
events or to media accounts of such events. It is still necessary to
consider the infection rate relative to the removal rate in order to
understand the public impact of any new idea or concept, since most
people’s awareness of any of these is still socially mediated. Thus
the likelihood of any event affecting market prices is enhanced if
there is a good, vivid, tellablestory about the event.
The importance of a tellable story for keeping the infection rate
of ideas high can be seen in many examples drawn from new-
product marketing, such as the promotion of motion pictures. Mar-
keters launch an ad campaign as the movie is first screened, to
attract the attention of especially receptive people. Only a small
fraction of the population responds directly to the initial adver-
tisements.Yet the success of the movie ultimately depends on the
reaction of these people to the film—and the opinions they pass on
to others. It is well known that the advice of movie critics has less
impact than the mass effect of such word of mouth. Producers have
learned over the years the importance of including set pieces in
movies. These are scenes that in and of themselves have story qual-
ity, scenes that, either during a screening or even as part of a
trailer, pack word-of-mouth potential analogous to that of popu-
lar jokes or tall tales—or stories linked to high-flying companies
on the nation’s exchanges.

==================================================

162 PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS
By analogy, news events that are more likely to be transmitted
in informal conversations are in turn more likely to contribute to
the contagion of ideas. The dry, analytical outlook an expert may
offer for the nation’s economy is very unlikely to be transmitted
by word of mouth. In contrast, news that the market has made a
sudden move is vastly more likely to be communicated. To be sure,
experts’ opinions sometimes tag along with news stories about price
movements, but they are seldom vivid enough to become the
focus of word-of-mouth communications by themselves.
Word-of-mouth communications, either positive or negative, are
an essential part of the propagation of speculative bubbles, and the
word-of-mouth potential of any event must be weighed in judg-
ing the likelihood of that event to lead to a speculative bubble. Thus,
for example, the predictions of widespread computer problems due
to the so-called Y2K bug was a classic word-of-mouth story because
of its association with both the nation’s fascination with computers
and the new millennium. Thus—although fears ultimately provided
groundless—it was likely to have an exaggerated impact on the mar-
ket when compared with other less vivid stories.
A Pool of Conflicting Ideas
Coexisting in the Human Mind
One reason why the contagion of ideas can sometimes happen
rapidly, and why public thinking can experience such abrupt
turnarounds, is that the ideas in question are already in our minds.
Even conflicting ideas can coexist at the same time in our minds, and
a shift in supporting facts or public attentions may suddenly bring
to the fore an apparent belief that contradicts formerly stated beliefs.
For example, people widely believe that the stock market is
unforecastable and that market timing is futile. But they also
believe (as we saw in Chapter 3) that if the stock market were to
crash, it would surely come back up. Such views are clearly
inconsistent.
One explanation for the fact that people are able to hold such
conflicting views simultaneously is that they thinkthey have heard
both views endorsed by experts. The culture transmits a number



==================================================
                     PAGE 186                     
==================================================

HERD BEHAVIOR AND EPIDEMICS 163
of supposed facts, often attributed only to “them,” as in “They say
that. . . .” When stories are casually accepted on some imagined
authority, conflicts are likely.
Sometimes, stories achieve currency even though they can be
traced to no competent authority whatsoever. One hears again and
again, for example, that “they say” that only 10% of the human brain
is actually used by most people—a myth that extends back to the
nineteenth century, when neurological science was clearly incapable
of either establishing or disproving such a fact. “They say” also that
the birth rate in New York City jumped nine months after a 1965
power blackout left New Yorkers with nothing to do for a while:
but there was no jump in the birth rate.16And, more apropos, “they
say” that there were an unusually high number of suicides at the
time of the crash of 1929, but there were not.17Stories that are use-
ful in conversations, and in media presentations, have a currency
often unrelated to the facts.
Given this tendency to attribute views to real or imagined experts,
people do not worry much about apparent contradictions among
the views they hold. There is a willingness to free ride here—to sup-
pose that the experts have thought through the apparent contra-
dictions and therefore to assume that the experts know why they
are not in fact contradictions at all. It is certainly true that sometimes
theories that appear to be contradictory really are not. And from there
it is but a short step to the supposition that the experts could
explain away most apparent contradictions—if one asked.
People’s thinking about the arcane field of investments is surely
clouded with many half-thought-through ideas that may be mutu-
ally contradictory, or at least have not been put into any coherent
analytical framework. It is a real challenge to try to infer what these
ideas will mean for concrete investment decisions.
The significance of the fact that contradictory views are held
simultaneously is that people may have no clear attachment to many
of their views. Therefore we cannot attach too much credence to
investors’ stated belief that the market will surely come back up
after a crash, for the circumstances of the actual crash could bring
to the forefront other, contradictory views that would explain
away a lack of market resilience. Investors would then react in ways

that could not have been foreseen based on their previously ex-
pressed confidence.
Socially Based Variations in Attention
The human brain is structured to have essentially a single focus
of conscious attention at a time, and to move rapidly from one focus
to another. The sensory experience that comes to us from our envi-
ronment is vastly complicated, and the brain manages to filter out
almost all of this complexity to produce a sense of the here and
now—an interpretation of what is most important at present—and
a sequence of thoughts that weave in this interpretation. Thus, for
example, when one is sitting in an airport waiting to board one’s
plane, one’s attention constantly returns to the theme “waiting to
board” and organizes many thoughts and observations around it,
as if it were the essence of current reality. One usually does not study
the weave of the carpet or the smudges of dirt on the windows, or
ponder the shape of the letters on the information screen, though
in principle one could. These details are typically beyond our
consciousness, even though we are receiving, and processing,
sensory information about them.
The ability to focus attention on important things is one of the
defining characteristics of intelligence, and no one really under-
stands how the brain does it. Failure to focus attention on the proper
things is also one of the most characteristic of human judgment
errors. The mechanism for focusing attention that has evolved in
the human brain, although remarkable, is still far from perfect.
If one looks back on some of the most significant errors one has
made in life, one is likely to find that these often arose from a fail-
ure to pay attention to details. One would have responded instantly
and changed one’s actions had someone repeatedly demanded
attention and pointed out certain key facts. Thus, in understanding
errors that people have made in the past, it is important to consider
what it was that they werenotpaying attention to.
One of the mechanisms that the brain has evolved to direct
attention properly is a socially based selectivity. We pay attention
to many of the same things that others around us are paying



==================================================

attention to. This social basis for attention allows individuals who
recognize the importance of some information to bring it to the
attention of other members of the community, and it creates a
view of the world and an information set that are common to the
community. Such a view and information set allow the commu-
nity to act well in concert. At the same time, the social component
of attention does not work perfectly, and it may cause errors to be
made in common by the entire group because the common focus
of attention pushes aside attention to details that individuals might
otherwise notice. As with individual attention, the phenomenon
of social attention is one of the great creations of behavioral evo-
lution and is critical for the functioning of human society, but it is
also an imperfect creation.
The social attention mechanism generates a sudden focus of the
attention of the entire community on matters that appear to be
emergencies. Thus, to return to the epidemic model, the infection
rate may suddenly and dramatically increase.Asudden major move
in the stock market is one of those events that pushes aside all other
conversation.
This social basis for attention, operating by word of mouth and
facilitated by media transmission of ideas, can generate attention
focuses that spread rapidly across much of the world. With a
substantial fraction of the human minds on the planet suddenly
grabbed by the market, it should not be at all surprising that mar-
kets on opposite sides of the globe move together, even if the fun-
damentals in different countries do not suggest any reason for such
co-movement.
People Cannot Explain Changes in Their Attention
Furthermore, people often find it very difficult to explain what made
them decide to take a certain course of action; the original atten-
tional trigger may not be remembered. This is a principal reason
whychanges in speculative asset prices, which very quickly reflect
changes in attention, often seem so inexplicable.
Price changes themselves may be an attention grabber, even
among professional investors. In a study of institutional investors’

166 PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS
choice of individual stocks, John Pound and I produced a list of
stocks whose prices had increased rapidly within the preceding year
and that also had high price-earnings ratios. We then obtained a
list of institutional investors who had reported to the Securities and
Exchange Commission that they had bought one of the stocks
(the experimental group) and compared these with a list of insti-
tutional investors in a random sample of stocks (the control group).
We asked respondents on both lists if they agreed with the fol-
lowingstatement regarding their stock (the rapid-price-increase stock
for the experimental group or the random stock for the control
group):“My initial interest was the result of my, or someone else’s,
systematic search over a large number of stocks (using a comput-
erized or similar search procedure) for a stock with certain char-
acteristics.”18Since these were investment professionals, it is perhaps
not surprising that 67% of the random sample, the control group,
said they agreed with this statement. But, among the experimen-
tal group, the investors in the rapid-price-increase stocks, only 25%
agreed. Since attentional triggers are often poorly remembered, we
cannotexpectthem to tell us that the price increase stimulated their
interest, but our experimental design shows that the price increase,
or associated events, did play a role in attracting their attention.
The important point is that most of the investors in rapid-price-
increase stocks themselves say that they were unsystematic in their
decision making.
When variations in attention are important causes of changing
behavior, we cannot expect people to tell us the reasons for their
changed behavior. People usually cannot easily explain what drew
their attention to something, and so they cannot explain their
own behavior.A1931 experiment by psychologist N. R. F. Maier
will illustrate. Maier presented his subjects with the problem of tying
two cords together: cords that were suspended from the ceiling far
enough apart that one could not reach them both at the same
time unless they were somehow brought together. Subjects were
given a number of tools with which to attempt this task and were
asked to see how many different ways they could invent to tie the
two cords together. One way to complete the task was to tie a weight
to the end of one of the cords, set it swinging like a pendulum, grab

the end of the other cord with one hand, and then catch the swing-
ing cord with the other hand. When the experimenter himself set
one of the cords swinging, many subjects quickly came up with this
idea. But when asked how they had hit upon the idea, only a third
of them mentioned having seen the swinging cord. The swinging
cord merely changed the focus of their attention, and most subjects
could not see the connection between their actions and the stim-
ulus that had given them the idea.19
By analogy, a stock market boom can start for no better reason
than that some factor, like the swinging cord, calls attention to the
market. In the context of the present stock market situation, such
events as spotting an ad for a mutual fund or the receipt of election
forms for an employer’s 401(k) plan may be the swinging cord. But
we will never learn about the importance of these stimuli from most
of our subjects by simply asking them. Even if people recall the stim-
uli, they will not be able to tell us howthey affected them.
The Story So Far
This chapter concludes the essence of my argument that irrational
exuberanceis at work in producing the elevated stock market lev-
els we have seen recently. We began in Part I with a list of twelve
precipitating factors, whose effect is sometimes amplified via feed-
back loops and naturally occurring Ponzi schemes, aided by the
lubricant of the news media as sometime promoter of market
exuberance. We saw evidence of strangely high investor confidence
and undiminished expectations for the market.
We then considered, in Part II, the cultural components of exu-
berance, the varying degrees of social attention to new era theories,
and the tendencies of these new era theories both to react to the
market and to stimulate it temporarily. In Part III we have stepped
back and examined some of the basic psychological factors that
allowed the changes described in the earlier parts to exert their
effects. Chapter 7 showed how trivial and barely visible psycho-
logical anchors may ultimately determine market levels, and how
investor overconfidence can strengthen the pull of these anchors.
The present chapter has attempted to resolve the essential puzzle

of the current market situation: that we see newly high valuations
but cannot detect a cause for those valuations that is associated with
rational public thinking.
In the remainder of the book, I place the theory of irrational
exuberance into a broader context. In the next part, I consider some
influential arguments against the notion that anything irrational
is going on. In the concluding chapter, I turn to the ultimate ques-
tions that this exuberance poses for policy: individual, institu-
tional, and governmental.

Efficient Markets,
Random Walks, and Bubbles
The theory that financial markets
are very efficient, and the exten-
sive research investigating this theory, form the leading intellectual
basis for arguments against the idea that markets are vulnerable
to excessive exuberance or bubbles. The efficient markets theory
asserts that all financial prices accurately reflect all public infor-
mation at all times. In other words, financial assets are always priced
correctly, given what is publicly known, at all times. Price may appear
to be too high or too low at times, but, according to the efficient
markets theory, this appearance must be an illusion.
Stock prices, by this theory, approximately describe “random
walks” through time: the price changes are unpredictable since they
occur only in response to genuinely new information, which by the
very fact that is new is unpredictable. The efficient markets theory
and the random walk hypothesis have been subjected to many tests
using data on stock markets, in studies published in scholarly jour-
nals of finance and economics. Although the theory has been sta-
tistically rejected many times in these publications, by some
interpretations it may nevertheless be described as approximately
true. The literature on the evidence for this theory is well developed

and includes work of the highest quality. Therefore, whether or not
we ultimately agree with it, we must at least take the efficient mar-
kets theory seriously.
Basic Arguments That Markets Are Efficient
and That Prices Are Random Walks
The idea of efficient markets is so natural that it has probably been
with us for centuries. Although the term efficient marketsapparently
first became widely known through the work of University of
Chicago professor Eugene Fama and his colleagues in the late
1960s, the theory itself preceded this name by many years.1 It
was clearly mentioned in 1889 in a book by George Gibson entitled
The Stock Markets of London, Paris and New York.Gibson wrote that
when “shares become publicly known in an open market, the value
which they acquire may be regarded as the judgment of the best
intelligence concerning them.”2In this century, the efficient mar-
kets theory has long been a fixture in university economics and
finance departments. The theory has commonly been offered to jus-
tify what seem to be elevated market valuations, for example, the
1929 stock market peak. Prof. Joseph Lawrence of Princeton con-
cluded in 1929 that “the consensus of judgment of the millions
whose valuations function on that admirable market, the Stock
Exchange, is that stocks are not at present over-valued.... Where
isthat group of men with all-embracing wisdom which will entitle
them to veto the judgment of the intelligent multitude?”3
The most simple and direct argument for efficient markets
theory comes from the observation that it seems to be difficult to
make a lot of money by buying low and selling high in the stock
market. Many seemingly capable people try but fail to do this with
any consistent degree of success. Moreover, one observes that
in order to make money one must compete against some of the
smartest investors, the so-called “smart money,” who trade in finan-
cial markets looking for the same opportunities. If one thinks that
an asset is either under- or overpriced, one must then reflect on why
it remains so despite the efforts of the smart money to make a prof-
itable trade.

                     PAGE 196                     
==================================================

EFFICIENT MARKETS, RANDOM WALKS, AND BUBBLES 173
If the smart money were able to find ways to make profits by
buying low and selling high, then the effect of such smart money
would be, according to the efficient markets theory, to drive asset
prices to their true values. They would be buying underpriced
stocks and thereby tending to bid their prices up. They would be
selling overpriced stocks and thereby tending to bid their prices
down. Moreover, if there were substantial mispricing of securities,
then their profits doing this trading would tend to make the smart
money into rich people, thereby increasing their influence on the
market and increasing their power to eliminate mispricing.
Unfortunately, this argument for the efficient markets hypoth-
esis does not tell us that the stock market cannot go through peri-
ods of significant mispricing lasting years or even decades. The
smart money could not make money rapidly by exploiting such
a profit opportunity, and there would be considerable uncertainty
about when the mispricing would end. If indeed one knew today
that the market would do poorly over the next ten or twenty years,
but did not know exactly whenit would begin do poorly and could
not prove one’s knowledge to a broad audience, then there would
be no way to profit significantly from this knowledge. There is thus
no substantial reason to think that the smart money must neces-
sarily eliminate such stock mispricing.
But this limitation of the efficient markets theory is often over-
looked. The assumption is made that the same efficient markets
theory that says that it is difficult to predict day-to-day changes
implies that one cannot predictanychanges.
Reflections on “Smart Money”
At its root, the efficient markets theory holds that differing abili-
ties do not produce differing investment performance. The theory
claims that the smartest people will not be able to do better than
the least intelligent people in terms of investment performance. They
can do no better because their superior understanding is already
completely incorporated into share prices.
If we accept the premise of efficient markets, not only is being
smart no advantage, but it also follows immediately that being not



==================================================
                     PAGE 197                     
==================================================

174 ATTEMPTS TO RATIONALIZE EXUBERANCE
so smartis not a disadvantageeither. If not-so-smart people could lose
money systematically in their trades, then this would suggest a profit
opportunity for the smart money: just do the opposite of what the
not-so-smart money does. Yet according to the efficient markets
theory, there can be no such profit opportunity for the smart money.
Thus according to this theory, effort and intelligence mean
nothing in investing. In terms of expected investment returns,
one might as well pick stocks at random—the common metaphor
of throwing darts at the stock market listings to choose investments.
It is ultimately for this reason that so many people think that they
do not need to pay attention to whether any given stock is or is not
overpriced, and why they feel they can ignore the unusual valu-
ation of the market today.
But why should the smartest people set all prices? Many appar-
ently less-intelligent or less well-informed people are buying and
selling—why should they not have an impact on prices?
One notion, referred to previously, is that the smartest money
has already mostly taken over the market through its profitable trad-
ing and has now set prices correctly; the less-intelligent investors
are holding so little as to be insignificant forces in the market. This
is an easy argument to dismiss. First of all, if this is the reason why
the smart money dominates, then it must have been the case that
therewereprofitable trades for them, otherwise they could not have
used their intelligence to take over the market. But if therewereprof-
itable trades, then there must still beprofitable trades, since smart
money investors retire from the business and must be replaced. One
cannot argue that smart money took over the market a hundred
years ago and that ever since they have dominated the market, since
those smart traders of yore are all dead now.
Another piece of evidence that has been offered in support of
the efficient markets theory is that professional investors, institu-
tional money managers, or securities analysts do not seem to have
any reliable ability to outperform the market as a whole, and
indeed they often seem to underperform the market once account
is taken of transactions costs and management fees. This result may
seem puzzling, since one would think that professional investors
are more educated about investing, more systematic than individual

investors. But perhaps the result is not as puzzling as it at first seems.
Individual investors get advice from professional investors, and
they can also observe (albeit with some time lag) what professional
investors are doing. So there may be no significant difference
between the success of professional investors and the market as
a whole, even if their analysis is very valuable to others. Individ-
ual investors with substantial resources tend to be educated and
intelligent people, too. Moreover, some recent studies have doc-
umented that professional analysts’ advice is indeed worth some-
thing, if it is acted upon swiftly enough.4
Ultimately the reason that studies have not found stronger evi-
dence that people who are smarter tend to make more money is
that there is no good way to measure how smart investors are. We
do not have databases giving the IQ scores of investment managers,
to enable us to compare their performances with their scores, and
even if we did, it is not clear that the available intelligence tests would
measure the right abilities.
One study, by Judith Chevalier and Glenn Ellison, did come close
to acquiring data about investment managers’ intelligence, by
tabulating the average Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores of the
colleges the investment managers attended. They did indeed find
some evidence that firms whose managers attended higher-SAT
colleges performed somewhat better, even after controlling for other
factors.5Certainly their one study does not settle the issue of intel-
ligence and investing success. Yet, from the available evidence, I
see no reason to doubt the thesis that smarter people will, in the
long run, tend to do better at investing.
Examples of “Obvious” Mispricing
Despite the general authority of the efficient markets theory in
popular thinking, one often hears examples that seem to offer
flagrant evidence against it. There are in fact many examples of
financial prices that, it seems, cannot possibly be right. They are
regularly reported in the media. Recently, many of these examples
have been Internet stocks: judging from their prices, the public
appears to have an exaggerated view of their potential.

itive $376 million.6In fact, Toys “R” Us, like other established toy
retailers, has now created its own Web site. Despite some initial dif-
ficulties getting its site launched, it has a longer-run advantage over
eToys in that dissatisfied purchasers of toys on the Internet can go
to one of its numerous retail outlets for returns or advice. In addi-
tion, customers who are already shopping at one of those outlets
may naturally gravitate to the Toys “R” Us Web site when they make
Web purchases.
The valuation the market places on stocks such as eToys appears
absurd to many observers, and yet the influence of these observers
on market prices does not seem to correct the mispricing. What
could they do that would have the effect of correcting it? Those who
doubt the value of these stocks could try to sell them short, and
some will, but their willingness to do so is limited since there is
always a possibility that the stock will be bid up even further by
enthusiastic investors. Absurd prices sometimes last a long time.
It seems obvious that investors in these stocks are not thinking
very clearly about long-run investment potential, and also that there
are no forces in the market to prevent these investors from caus-
ing substantial overpricing. Doesn’t such evidence clearly speak
against market efficiency, at least for some stocks? And if some
stocks can be overpriced, then does it not follow that the market
as a whole can be overpriced, given that those stocks are part of
the market?
Questioning the Examples of Obvious Mispricing
Still, despite the apparent obviousness of some examples of mis-
pricing, there are those who question the examples. Jeremy Siegel,
in his book Stocks for the Long Run,points out that some of the most

==================================================

EFFICIENT MARKETS, RANDOM WALKS, AND BUBBLES 177
widely cited examples of mispricings in years gone by really
made sense in the long run. Siegel cites a list of fifty stocks that were
apparently called the “Nifty Fifty” as early as 1970 or 1972: glam-
orous stocks for which people had high expectations and that
traded at very high price-earnings ratios. The list includes some
high-tech firms, such as IBM and Xerox, as well as some high-
profile consumer products firms, such as Coca-Cola and McDonald’s.
These stocks were cited in a 1977 Forbes magazine article as
examples of investors’ folly after the values of the Nifty Fifty
plummeted following the 1973–74 stock market debacle.7
Siegel showed that, as a group, the Nifty Fifty stocks really were
not overpriced in 1970 for the long run. If you had bought and held
an equally weighted portfolio of these stocks from 1970 until 1996,
you would have done as well as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.8
This example appears to provide evidence that clearly refutes the
claim that there are times when stock prices are just plain wrong.
If the Nifty Fifty are examples of absurdly overpriced stocks, then
it seems that we have failed to make our case that such examples
are proof of market irrationality.
Peter Garber, in his book Famous First Bubbles, argues that the
most famous bubble of all, the seventeenth-century tulip mania in
Holland, was not a clear example of irrational mispricing either.
The story of the tulip mania, popularized in a book by Charles
Mackay in 1841, is so well known today as to be part of our pop-
ular culture, and it is widely cited as an example of a speculative
bubble. The term refers to a time when prices of tulip bulbs reached
what seemed like absurd levels and then crashed. In 1636, for
example, a single tulip bulb was sold in exchange for twelve acres
of building land. In his book Mackay claimed that people were
“insensibly attached” to the tulip trade and that “the rage among
the Dutch to possess them [tulips] was so great that the ordinary
industry of the country was neglected.”9
But Mackay offered no concrete evidence that people were be-
having insensibly and moreover could not show that the rage had
anything to do with any speculative mispricing. Garber points out
that the really high prices were for rare varieties of tulips that had
unusual patterns of coloration due, we now know, to infection by

178 ATTEMPTS TO RATIONALIZE EXUBERANCE
a mosaic virus. These tulips could not be readily propagated and
were genuinely rare. People in Holland at the time highly valued
these unusual tulips, which had great significance in their culture.10
Thus there is nothing more foolish about their high tulip prices than
about the high prices that rare art objects or other collectibles often
fetch today. Moreover, the price behavior of the tulip bulbs looks
rather like that of the prices of many other speculative assets;
they did not boom once, crash once, and then stay down as some
simple stories suggest. Prices of tulips went up and down numer-
ous times, just as stock prices do all the time. These price changes
could well have had some rational basis in new information about
public demand for rare flowers becoming known to investors
over time.
These analyses by Siegel and Garber impugn some of the
favorite examples of irrational prices in speculative markets. But
there is actually little evidence in favor of efficient markets theory
to be found in their analyses.
Although it is true that investors who held for the really long
run did all right in the Nifty Fifty, almost all of the investors who
held them in 1970 probably sold long before 1996, at a loss. We can-
not really believe that all those investors in 1970 knew that the prices
would come back up by the 1990s and would wait until then to
redeem them.
Moreover, these fifty stocks are not fifty independent pieces of
evidence that add up to strong evidence; they are firms in similar
industries at similar times. And, as Siegel himself notes, if one con-
siders the top twenty-five firms in the Nifty Fifty when ranked by
price-earnings ratio, these firms are still far underperforming the
market.
Consider the firm with the highest price-earnings ratio of the
Nifty Fifty in 1972: Polaroid Corporation, the ultimate “story” stock,
which was then priced at 94.8 times earnings. Its founder, Edwin
Land, had dropped out of Harvard as a freshman, much as Bill
Gates did decades later, to develop an idea for polarized light fil-
ters. He founded Polaroid to produce the filters and market them
in a number of applications, including not only scientific devices
but also sunglasses and 3-D movies. Over the course of his career

==================================================

EFFICIENT MARKETS, RANDOM WALKS, AND BUBBLES 179
Land produced hundreds of inventions, including the celebrated
Polaroid camera that developed photographs instantly. Some of his
inventions and applications were intriguing novelties that were
readily visible to the general public. His youthful move to estab-
lish what was then a novel high-tech firm provided a sensational
story that makes its subsequent overpricing by the general pub-
lic unsurprising. Polaroid Corporation was the 1970s version of a
glamorous Internet stock, and it has indeed turned out badly
since then: between 1972 and 1997 it underperformed the market
by 11.2% a year.11
Thus, even after Siegel’s evidence we still have many firms
that look like examples of wild mispricing when 1970 prices are
examined even decades later. Moreover, Siegel himself does not
claim that his evidence suggests that all prices are right, and he argues
that today many Internet stocks have indeed been overpriced.12
Likewise, Peter Garber, in his analysis of the tulip mania, also stops
short of a complete rejection of the evidence for mispricing. Not-
ing that in January 1636 even common tulip bulbs, not only those
infected with the mosaic virus, increased twentyfold in price and
then underwent a precipitous decline, he confesses that he is “hard
pressed to find a market fundamental explanation” for this event.13
Statistical Evidence of Mispricings
It is difficult to make any solid judgments about market efficiency
based on a few anecdotes about alleged extreme mispricing of
assets. But in fact there is no shortage of systematic evidence that
firms that are “overpriced” by conventional measures have indeed
tended to do poorly afterward. Many articles in academic finance
journals show this, not by colorful examples but by systematic
evaluation of large amounts of data on many firms. For example,
Sanjoy Basu found in 1977 that firms with high price-earnings ratios
tend to do poorly subsequently, and Eugene Fama and Kenneth
French in 1992 found the same for stocks with high price-to-book
value.14Werner De Bondt and Richard Thaler reported in 1985 that
firms whose price has risen a great deal over five years tend to go
down in price in the next five years, and that firms whose price has

==================================================

180 ATTEMPTS TO RATIONALIZE EXUBERANCE
declined a great deal over five years tend to go up in price in the
succeeding five years.15(In Chapter 6 we saw that a similar tendency
has held for national stock markets around the world.) Jay Ritter
found in 1991 that initial public offerings tend to occur at the peak
of industry-specific investor fads and then to show gradual but sub-
stantial price declines relative to the market over the subsequent three
years.16Thus there is a sort of regression to the mean (or to longer-
run past values) for stock prices: what goes up a lot tends to come
back down, and what goes down a lot tends to come back up.
These findings, and similar findings by many other researchers,
have encouraged an approach to the market called value investing,
that of picking portfolios of stocks that are underpriced by con-
ventional measures, on the theory that they have been overlooked
only temporarily by investors and will appreciate eventually. The
other side of this strategy is to sell overpriced stocks short. One
might think that the effect on the market of so many value investors
would be to reduce, and even possibly eliminate for a time, the rela-
tion across stocks between value and subsequent returns. Value
investors are after all buying the underpriced assets and bidding
up their prices, and also diverting demand away from overpriced
assets.
Many value investing strategies will probably cease to work as
investors flock to exploit them, yet it certainly does not follow that
value investing as a whole will ever be out for good. There are many
different ways to define value, and the market as a whole is not
going to find it easy to eliminate all such profit opportunities.
Moreover, even if the effect of value on returnacross stocksdis-
appears, it does not follow that the effect of value on returnover
time for the market as a wholemust also disappear. The characteris-
tic strategy of value investors is to pull out of overvalued individual
stocks, but not to pull out of the market as a whole when it appears
to be overvalued.
Earnings Changes and Price Changes
Another argument that markets are basically efficient, in the most
global sense, is merely that stock prices roughly track earnings over

time—that despite great fluctuations in earnings, price-earnings
ratios have stayed within a comparatively narrow range.
Peter Lynch, an investment analyst appearing frequently in the
media these days, in an advertisement for Fidelity Investments that
features a full-page photograph of him, is quoted in banner red let-
ters: “Despite 9 recessions since WWII, the stock market’s up 63-
fold because earnings are up 54-fold. Earnings drive the market.”
The ad appears to be designed to convince readers that price
growth is approximately justified by earnings growth. But in fact
the numbers are deceptive. When such a long time interval is cho-
sen for comparison, when no inflation correction is made, and since
earnings were very low right after World War II, it is not surpris-
ing that Lynch can find such a correspondence. But if other
examples are chosen, price changes may seem far less justified by
earnings growth.17 Lynch’s statement is indicative of a common
view that stock price changes are generally justified by earnings
changes, and that this proves that stock market price movements
are not due to any irrational behavior on the part of investors.
As we have noted, there have been only three great bull mar-
kets, periods of sustained and dramatic stock price increase, in U.S.
history: the bull market of the 1920s, culminating in 1929; the bull
market of the 1950s and 1960s, followed by the 1973–74 market
debacle; and the bull market running from 1982 to the present. (One
might also add the bull market leading to the peak in 1901, but it
was not so dramatic.)
The first great bull market, from 1920 to 1929, was a period of
rapid earnings growth. Real S&PComposite earnings tripled over
this period, and real stock prices increased almost sevenfold. The
market change might be viewed as a reaction to the earnings change,
albeit an overreaction.
But in the second great bull market, the correspondence between
price growth and earnings growth is not so clear. Most of the
price growth then occurred in the 1950s, and from January 1950
to December 1959 the real S&PComposite Index almost tripled.
But real S&P earnings grew only 16% in total over this entire
decade, an earnings performance that was below average by his-
torical standards. In terms of overall economic growth, the 1950s



==================================================
                     PAGE 205                     
==================================================

182 ATTEMPTS TO RATIONALIZE EXUBERANCE
are a little above average, though not as strong as either the 1940s
or the 1960s: average real gross domestic product growth was
3.3% a year from 1950 to 1960.
In the third great bull market, real stock prices have risen more
or less continually from 1982 to 1999, but earnings have not grown
at all uniformly. Real S&PComposite earnings were actually lower
at the bottom of the recession of 1991 than they were at the bot-
tom of the recession of 1982, but the real S&PComposite Index
was almost two and a half times as high. So, in this bull market,
price increases cannot be viewed as a simple reaction to earnings
increases.
These examples show that earnings growth and price growth
do not correspond well at all. One cannot criticize bubble theories
by claiming that they do.
Dividend Changes and Price Changes
If stock prices show no clear relation to earnings, there is still the
question of dividends. It has been claimed by some economists that
there is a good relation between real stock price movements and
real dividend movements. Economists Robert Barsky and Brad De
Long have argued that stock price movements cannot be consid-
ered to have been caused largely by the speculative behavior of
investors if they correspond to dividend movements.18They sug-
gest that perhaps people were rational to suppose that the recent
growth of dividends would continue indefinitely into the future—
even though in fact this growth rate has never continued for very
long in actual historical data.
Kenneth Froot and Maurice Obstfeld, reacting to the same
appearance of co-movement between prices and dividends, pos-
tulated an “intrinsic bubble” model in which prices respond in an
apparently exaggerated fashion, but in fact rationally, to dividend
movements. In their theory, stock prices overreact, in a certain sense,
to dividends, but yet there are no profit opportunities to trading
to take advantage of this overreaction.19
I think that these authors overstate their case for co-movements
between dividends and prices. The wiggles in stock prices do not

                     PAGE 206                     
==================================================

EFFICIENT MARKETS, RANDOM WALKS, AND BUBBLES 183
in fact correspond very closely to wiggles in dividends. Recall that
between the stock market peak in September 1929 and the bottom
in June 1932, when the stock market fell 81% as measured by the
real S&PIndex, real dividends fell only 11%. Between the stock mar-
ket peak in January 1973 and the bottom in December 1974, when
the stock market fell 54% as measured by the real S&PIndex, real
dividends fell only 6%. And there are many other such examples.
It is also likely that part of the reason for the observed co-
movementbetween real prices and real dividends is the response
of dividends to the same factors—possibly including speculative
bubbles—that irrationally influence price. Managers set dividends,
and in so doing may vary over time the dividend-earnings ratio,
that is, the payout rate. The managers are part of the same culture
as the investing public, and are therefore probably influenced
often enough by the same varying sense of optimism and pessimism
that infects the public; they may allow this feeling to influence their
decisions on how much of a dividend to pay out. Thus the mere
fact that prices and dividends show some substantial similarity is
not inconsistent with the possibility that they are both influenced
by fashions and fads.
In sum, stock prices clearly have a life of their own; they are not
simply responding to earnings or dividends. Nor does it appear
that they are determined only by information about future earn-
ings or dividends. In seeking explanations of stock price move-
ments, we must look elsewhere.
Excess Volatility and the Big Picture
There is indeed a good deal of evidence about market efficiency
in academic finance journals, but it is hard to say that it is evidence
forefficiency rather than against it. Agreat many anomalies have
been discovered over the years within the efficient markets theory.
There are the January effect (stock prices tend to go up between
December and January), the small-firm effect (small firms’ stocks
tend to have higher returns), the day-of-the-week effect (the stock
market tends to do poorly on Mondays), and others.20How then
can we summarize this literature as supporting market efficiency?



==================================================
                     PAGE 207                     
==================================================

184 ATTEMPTS TO RATIONALIZE EXUBERANCE
One way of arguing that the literature nevertheless supports
market efficiency is to claim that many of these have been small
effects, not the stuff of bull or bear markets. Another way is to note
that many of these effects disappeared after they were discovered,
as indeed the January effect and the small-firm effect seem to have
disappeared. This makes it tricky to summarize the literature. On
the one hand, the fact that these anomalies persisted for a long time
shows that markets are inefficient. On the other hand, the fact that
many of them have disappeared suggests that there is a basic truth
to the theory.21
Merton Miller, a leading advocate of efficient markets theory, rec-
ognizes that there are indeed many little anomalies, but he argues
that they are inconsequential: “That we abstract from all these stories
in building our models is not because the stories are uninterest-
ing but because they may be too interesting and thereby distract
us from the pervasive market forces that should be our principal
concern.”22But he does not explain his presumption that the per-
vasive market forces are rational ones.
Abstracting (as Miller urges us to do) from the little details about
day-of-the-week effects and the like, what is the basic evidence that
stock markets are efficient in the big-picture sense? Do large
changes in stock prices over the years really reflect information
about important changes in the underlying companies?
The evidence that there is not much short-run momentum or
inertia—that there is not much predictability of day-to-day or
month-to-month changes in stock price indexes—does not tell us
anything about efficiency in the big-picture sense. We already
know from simple economic reasoning that day-to-day changes in
stock prices cannot be very forecastable, since such forecastability
would be too good a profit opportunity to be true.
One method for judging whether there is evidence in support
of the basic validity of the efficient markets theory, which I pub-
lished in an article in the American Economic Reviewin 1981 (at the
same time as a similar paper by Stephen LeRoy and Richard
Porter appeared), is to see whether the very volatility of specula-
tive prices, such as stock prices, can be justified by the variability
of dividends over long intervals of time. If the stock price move-

==================================================

ments are to be justified in terms of the future dividends that firms
pay out, as the basic version of the efficient markets theory would
imply, then under efficient markets we cannot have volatile prices
without subsequently volatile dividends.23
In fact, my article concluded, no movement of U.S. aggregate
stock prices beyond the trend growth of prices has ever been sub-
sequently justified by dividend movements, as the dividend pres-
ent value has shown an extraordinarily smooth growth path. This
conclusion, coming at a time when the finance profession was much
more attached to the efficient markets theory than it is now, pro-
duced a strong reaction. I received more attacks on this work than
I could hope to answer. No one questioned the observation that
stock prices have been more volatile than the dividend present
value—only whether the difference between the two was statis-
tically significant or whether my interpretation of this difference
was on target.
Included in my article was a figure showing the real (inflation-
corrected) S&PComposite Stock Price Index for 1871–1979 and, on
the same figure, the dividend present value,the present value for each
year of real dividends paid subsequent to that year on the shares
making up the index, computed by making an assumption about
dividends after the last year.An updated version of that figure,
showing both the stock price and the dividend present value
through 2000, is shown as Figure 9.1. The curves shown to the left
of 1980 are essentially the same as those shown in my 1981 article.24
The dividend present value is not known with certainty in the
year to which it corresponds, since it is determined entirely by div-
idends after the year, which have yet to be paid. According to the
efficient markets model, the dividend present value subsequent to
any given year is the (as yet unknown) true fundamental value of
the stock market in that year. The actual level of the real stock mar-
ket in that same year, the stock price shown in Figure 9.1, is sup-
posed to be the optimal prediction, using information available in
that year, of the dividend present value shown for the same year.
Looking at this figure, we can get a sense of the extent of big-
picture, important evidence for the efficiency of the aggregate stock
market in the United States. If the dividend present value moved

up and down massively over time, and if the actual stock price
appeared to move with these movements as if it were successfully
forecasting the changes in the dividend present value, then we
could say that there was evidence that stock prices were behaving
in accordance with the tenets of the efficient markets theory. But we
see no such tendency of the stock price to forecast the dividend pres-
ent value: the dividend present value is not doing anything espe-
cially dramatic, whereas the price is jumping around a great deal.25
The dividend present value is extremely steady and trendlike,
partly because it extends so far into the future and partly because
dividends have not moved very dramatically. Now that one sees it
plotted, it seems obvious from what some of us (who have thought
about it and have good intuitive grasp of quantities) have always

known at gut level: these big stock market movements were not in
fact justified by what actually happened to dividends later. One might
try to argue that a little over a century is not a long enough time
period to be confident that one wouldexpect to see such justification,
but the fact still remains that there has been no such justification.
Let us concentrate first on the portion of Figure 9.1 to the left of
1980, which was available when I published my findings in 1981.
The dividend present value calculation has smoothed out the year-
to-year fluctuations in dividends. Dividend fluctuations have had
little impact on the dividend present value because these fluctuations
have always been temporary.
Look, for example, at the change in the dividend present value
over the bull market years of the 1920s, culminating in 1929. The
real S&PComposite Index increased 415.4% from its low in Decem-
ber 1920 to its high in September 1929. At the same time, the div-
idend present value increased by only 16.4%.
Why is there such a discrepancy between the growth of the stock
price and the growth of the dividend present value? Real dividends
paid on the S&PComposite Index rose 106.7% over this interval,
far short of the 415% increase in real stock prices but still much
higher than the increase in the dividend present value. If the over-
all dividends were growing so much during the 1920s, then why
was their present value growing so little? The answer is that the
dividend increase of the 1920s did not last long; it was confined
largely to the 1920s and so did not contribute enormously to the
present value of all real future dividends out to infinity. The grow-
ing dividends of the 1920s were just a small part of the long-run
picture that the market is supposed, according to the efficient
markets theory, to price, and that price should not be overly influ-
enced by a few years’ fluctuation in dividends.
Look, too, at the movement of the value of real dividends over
the years subsequent to 1929, including the Great Depression
ofthe 1930s. While the real S&PComposite Index dropped disas-
trously, down 80.6% from the peak in September 1929 to the bottom
in June 1932, the dividend present value dropped only 3.1%. The rea-
son that the decline in the dividend present value is so small between
1929 and 1932 is that dividends just did not fall dramaticallyor for

==================================================

188 ATTEMPTS TO RATIONALIZE EXUBERANCE
very long. Real dividends actually fell little between September 1929
and June 1932, since firms were reluctant to cut their nominal
dividends by as much as the deflation in the economywide price
level would suggest.
Thus, ex post, we know that the run-up in the stock market from
1920 to 1929 was a colossal mistake and that the drop from 1929 to
1932 was another colossal mistake. Virtually nothing actually hap-
pened over either of these intervals to the dividend present value.
Of course, people might have thoughtthat there really was news
that was going to change the longer-run course of dividends,and
they might have thoughtthere was a reason for a sudden drop in
prices. They might even have had plausible-sounding reasons to
think so. But in fact no such change occurred.
The point I made in 1981 was that stock prices appear to be too
volatile to be considered in accord with efficient markets. If stock
prices are supposed to be an optimal predictor of the dividend pres-
ent value, then they should not jump around erratically when the
true fundamental value is growing along a smooth trend.
We learn by considering Figure 9.1 that the common interpre-
tation given in the media for stock market fluctuations in terms
of the outlook for the short-run business cycle is generally mis-
guided. The prospect that a temporary recession is on the horizon
should have virtually no impact on stock prices, if the efficient mar-
kets theory is correct. Fluctuations in stock prices, if they are to be
interpretable in terms of the efficient markets theory, must instead
be due to new information about the long-run outlook for real div-
idends.Yet in the entire history of the U.S. stock market we have
never seen such fluctuations, since dividends have fairly closely
followed a steady growth path. As I argued in my 1981 paper, the
only way to reconcile the volatility of stock prices with the efficient
markets model is to suppose that, one way or the other, the his-
torical fluctuations of dividends around their growth path are
not representative of the potentialfluctuations. That is, one would
have to say that the fluctuations observed in market prices were
the result of people’s legitimate concerns with possible major and
lasting dividend movements that just did not chance to happen in
the century of data we observe. For example, people might have

been concerned about a big, rare event, such as a complete nation-
alization and confiscation of the stock market by the government,
or an enormous technological breakthrough that would make
existing companies able to pay many times more dividends.
As noted earlier, my work invited the attention of an army of
critics. Most notable among them was Robert Merton, a brilliant
financial theorist who was later to win the Nobel Prize in economics
(and also to suffer a major financial loss as a principal in the Long
Term Capital Management hedge fund). Merton, with Terry Marsh,
wrote an article in the American Economic Reviewin 1986 that argued
against my results and concluded, ironically, that speculative mar-
kets were not too volatile.26
John Campbell and I wrote a number of papers attempting to
put these claims of excess volatility on a more secure footing, and
we developed statistical models to study the issue and deal with
some of the problems emphasized by the critics.27We felt that we
had established in a fairly convincing way that stock markets do
violate the efficient markets model.
Our research has not completely settled the matter, however.
There are just too many possible statistical issues that can be raised,
and the sample provided by only a little over a century of data
cannot prove anything conclusively.
It should also be noted that some substantial fraction of the
volatility in financial markets isprobably justified by news about
future dividends or earnings. The very trendlike behavior of U.S.
corporate dividends over the past century was probably partly due
to luck, not a law saying that dividends must hug a trend. Taking
account of uncertainty about the trend, Campbell and I, in inter-
preting the results of one of our statistical studies, estimated that
27% of the annual return volatility of the U.S. stock market might
be justified in terms of genuine information about future divi-
dends.28Campbell and John Ammer, using similar methodology
and a more recent (postwar) data set, found that 15% of the vari-
ability in monthly returns in the U.S. stock market could be attrib-
uted to genuine information about future dividends.29
I have found less evidence of excess volatility in long-term in-
terest rates and little evidence of excess volatility in the spread

between stock price indexes.30Excess volatility due to speculative
bubbles is probably just one of the factors that drive speculative
markets, and the prominence of this factor varies across markets
and over time. We are not always in an excess volatility situation.
The Graph Updated
But we do seem to be in such a situation in the stock market now.
The data set that I used for my paper on excess volatility of stock
prices ended in 1979, over twenty years ago. One can see what has
happened to stock prices since then by looking at the curves in Fig-
ure 9.1 to the right of 1979. What a transformation twenty years
of data has brought! The price series, terminating in 2000, has shot
up, relative to dividends, beyond anything seen before.31
One interpretation of Figure 9.1 is that the sudden spike repre-
sents the “big, rare event” that might finally reconcile the efficient
markets theory with these data. But it would have to be a sudden,
sharp spike in the dividendseries, not the price series, to suggest
such a reconciliation with the efficient markets theory. The spike
in price alone only deepens the excess volatility puzzle and requires
that dividends will have to move much farther indeed if their move-
ments are to save the simple efficient markets model.
The invocation of efficient markets theory to imply that the recent
upspike in the stock market is a routine and accurate response to
genuine news is just not correct. To justify the notion that the
stock market is at the appropriate level now, we would have to
argue that it was not before. Such an argument would stand in sharp
contradiction to efficient markets theory—and yet we cannot dis-
miss that argument out of hand, given the large number of people
advancing it. So we turn to that argument in the next chapter.

Investor Learning—and Unlearning
Besides the efficient markets–
random walk argument, another
rationalization for the exuberance in the market is that the public
at large has learned that the long-term value of the market is really
greater than they had thought it was, and greater than conventional
indicators would have suggested it should be. According to this
theory, the market is higher today because the public has now
learned some simple facts about historical average returns and
diversification. This argument differs from the efficient markets
argument in supposing that the market was previously priced too
low because of public ignorance. The argument is essentially that
“The market was not efficient a few years ago; it was too low; but
(maybe) it is efficient now.”
It is potentially plausible, at least at first look, that society may
have learned that the market is much more valuable than it was
once thought to be. Society as a whole does learn, and the cumu-
lative effect of such learning is the reason that modern society has
made such progress when compared with former centuries. But
the question remains whether society has really learned something

important about the stock market. Is this really true? If so, what
have we learned?
“Learning” about Risk
It is commonly said that people have recently learned that the stock
market is much less risky than they once thought it was, and that
the stock market has always outperformed other investments.
Their “learning” is allegedly the result of widespread media cov-
erage in the past few years of the historical superiority of stocks as
investments, and of the publication in 1994 of the first edition of
Jeremy Siegel’s book Stocks for the Long Run.According to this view,
people have realized that, in light of historical statistics, they have
been too fearful of stocks. Armed with this new knowledge,
investors have now bid stock prices up to a higher level, to their
rational or true level, where the stocks would have been all along
had there not been excessive fear of them. Stocks, selling now at
a higher price, will pay a correspondingly lower yield—but that
is all right with investors, since they now know that stocks are not
all that risky. In other words, the equity premium,the extra return that
people require to be compensated for the risk of investing in the
stock market, has gone down because investors have suddenly come
to appreciate the historical record of stock market risk.1
It is true that the public does appear to perceive less risk in the
stock market than they did ten years ago. In Chapter 3 we saw sur-
vey results that showed that people now tend to believe that a large
one-day stock market decline will be reversed the next day. We saw
that there is now strong popular support for the notion that if there
is another stock market crash, the market will surely be back up
within a couple of years or so. So it is clear that the possibility of
major stock market declines does not worry most people very much
anymore. But is this because people have acquired some genuinely
new knowledge? Or are the new public opinions caused by some-
thing altogether different—and ephemeral?
Aproblem with this “new learning” theory is that the histori-
cal fact that investors have supposedly learned—that the stock mar-
ket has largely outperformed other investments—is not a new

INVESTOR LEARNING—AND UNLEARNING 193
revelation. In fact, a best-selling book in 1924 by Edgar Lawrence
Smith made a number of historical comparisons of investments in
stocks versus bonds and found that stocks always came out ahead
over long holding periods, in both periods of rising general prices
(inflation) and periods of declining general prices (deflation).2
Smith emphasized—as did another author at the time, Kenneth Van
Strum—that investing in bonds was risky, too, because, even
though the nominal values of bond payments are fixed, their real
value fluctuates with the general price level.3
According to Prof. Irving Fisher, writing in 1929, “These writ-
ings threw a bombshell into the investing world.” Fisher thought
that the bull market of the 1920s occurred because the public had
learned from these books: “It was only as the public came to real-
ize, largely through the writing of Edgar Lawrence Smith, that stocks
were to be preferred to bonds during a period of dollar depreci-
ation, that the bull market began in good earnest to cause a proper
valuation of common shares.”4
Others shared Fisher’s belief about public learning. Charles
Amos Dice wrote in 1929 that “the old prejudice against security
markets and the fear of them have been largely dispelled by pub-
lic education regarding stocks and bonds.”5Awriter for the New
York Herald Tribune asserted in 1929: “It is gratifying to observe
thegrowth of business.... But there is a much larger significance
in the growth of understanding among the people who make the
growth of business possible.... There is nothing to retard the prog-
ress of any sound industry when an increasing number of people
believe in it, become part owners in the business, and are regularly
and reliably informed.”6
If people did learn in 1929 that stocks dominated bonds at
1920s prices, they seem to have forgotten the information later,
orat least changed their feelings about it. The question before us
now is: Observing the recent stock market, have they really “learned”
this time that stocks always outperform bonds, and will they con-
tinue to “know” this in the future?
The “fact” that is widely cited is that in the United States there
has been no thirty-year period over which bonds have outperformed
stocks. The supposed fact is not really true, since, as Jeremy Siegel

194 ATTEMPTS TO RATIONALIZE EXUBERANCE
himself points out in his book Stocks for the Long Run, stocks
underperformed bonds in the period 1831–61.7That may seem like
a long time ago until one realizes that there are not that many
nonoverlapping thirty-year periods in U.S. stock market history:
only four complete periods since 1861. There are many overlapping
thirty-year periods, but of course these are not independent pieces
of evidence. Given the relatively short history of thirty-year peri-
ods of stock market returns, we must recognize that there is little
evidence that stocks cannot underperform in the future.
If we take ten-year periods as our standard, then we do get some
more recent periods when stocks have underperformed short-term
interest rates. I have identified in this book three major peaks of
the price-earnings ratio before the recent period: peaks in June 1901,
September 1929, and January 1966. In the ten-year period follow-
ing two of these three peaks (the 1929 and 1966 peaks), the period
stock market return underperformed short-term interest rates.8If
we take twenty-year periods as our standard, then it is true that,
of these three time periods, only in the 1901–21 period did stocks
really underperform short-term interest rates.9 But in each of
the twenty-year periods following these peaks, the stock market
has done badly in real (inflation-corrected) terms. The (geometric)
average real return on the S&P Composite Index was –0.2% a
year from June 1901 to June 1921, 0.4% a year from September 1929
to September 1949, and 1.9% a year from January 1966 to January
1986. Despite these puny returns, the stock market still outper-
formed short-term interest rates during 1929–49 and 1966–86
because inflation brought real average short-term interest rates to
very low levels, in fact to negative territory in 1929–49. The infla-
tionary periods associated with World War I, World War II, and the
Vietnam War all had the effect of wiping out the purchasing power
of money earning interest. It is hard to see the relevance to today’s
situation of the fact that inflation wiped out the real value of short-
term interest in those historical periods. Todaywe have long-term
inflation-indexed bonds yielding over 4%, guaranteed against the
effects of inflation.
Moreover, the United States may itself be the exception rather
than the rule in terms of real returns on the stock market. Philippe

Jorion and William Goetzmann have studied the real stock
market appreciation rates (excluding dividends) for thirty-nine
countries for the period 1926–96 and found that the median real
appreciation rate was only 0.8% per year for these countries
(compared to 4.3% per year for the United States).10Thus, if we
take the experience of other countries as relevant to our own, we
might expect a much poorer performance of the stock market in
the future.
The evidence that stocks will alwaysoutperform bonds over long
time intervals simply does not exist. Moreover, even if history
supported this view, we should recognize (and at some level most
people must recognize) that the future will not necessarily be like
the past. For example, it could be that, with investors buoyed by
past successes in the stock market, there is now widespread over-
investment. Companies may have hatched too many ambitious
plans and spent too much on product development and promotion;
therefore they may not do as well as they have in the past. It could
also be that some of the very technological changes that are widely
touted as reasons for optimism for existing businesses are in fact
reasons why their prospects are more uncertain. New technology
may diminish the advantage enjoyed by existing companies and
cause them to be replaced by upstart newer companies. Thus these
changes could raise, not lower, the probability that stocks will under-
perform in the next thirty years. Most important, the future is def-
initely not like the past in that, given the high price-earnings
ratios documented previously, the market is more highly priced
than ever before.
So the “fact” of the superiority of stocks over bonds is not a fact
at all. The public has not learned a fundamental truth. Instead, their
attention has shifted awayfrom some fundamental truths. They seem
not to be so attentive to at least one genuine fundamental truth
about stocks: that they are residual claims on corporate cash flow,
available to stockholders only after everyone else has been paid.
Stocks are, therefore, by their very definition, risky. Investors have
also lost sight of another truth: that no one is guaranteeingthat stocks
will do well. There is no welfare plan for people who lose in the
stock market.

196 ATTEMPTS TO RATIONALIZE EXUBERANCE
The “Stocks Have Always Outperformed Bonds”
Theme in Investing Culture
Nine years ago I was already so struck by the ubiquity of the
observation that stocks have historically outperformed bonds that
I decided to try to learn how common the observation really was.
I asked the following in a questionnaire survey of U.S. institutional
investors in 1991:
Consider the following argument:
“Over the past 65 years, stocks have earned much higher returns
than bonds and there has been no 20-year period since 1926 that
bonds have outperformed stocks. Therefore, anyone with a time hori-
zon of 20 years or more should be investing primarily in stocks.”
[Circle one number]
1. I agree with this statement.
2. I disagree with this statement.
Of the 172 respondents, 84% chose 1 and only 16% chose 2—very
solid agreement on a strongly worded statement.
The question as worded did not make it clear how often the
respondents had heard that stocks have always outperformed
bonds. To clarify this, in the fall of 1993 I asked institutional
investors a similar but differently worded question:
Consider the following claim:
“There is no 30-year period since 1860 in which U.S. government
bonds have outperformed stocks.” Have you heard roughly this
claim (even if the details, such as the use of 30 years, are different)?
1. Yes, often
2. Yes, once or twice
3. No
Of the 125 respondents, 52% chose “Yes, often,” 22% chose “Yes,
once or twice,” and 26% chose “No.” Thus 74% say they remember
hearing this statement. Clearly statements like this were already
part of our investing culture then.
Knowledge about the long-run historical record, knowledge that
dates back at least to 1924 and that clearly was widely remembered
in 1991 or 1993, cannot be held directly responsible for the sudden
upsurge in stock prices to record levels in the late 1990s. The knowl-

edge was apparently in investors’ faces all along. The public con-
fidence that any downturn in the market will be reversed has indeed
gained remarkable strength in recent years, but this confidence does
not derive from a sudden news flash about the historical record.
As I have argued, it derives from such things as a feedback mech-
anism from past price increases (discussed in Chapter 3), driven
ultimately by various precipitating factors (discussed in Chap-
ter 2)—not a sudden discovery of the lessons from long-run his-
torical data.
Learning about Mutual Funds, Diversification,
and Holding for the Long Run
James Glassman and Kevin Hassett, in a pair of influentialWall
Street Journal articles in 1998 and 1999, argued that “investors
have become better educated about stocks, thanks in large part to
mutual funds and the media. They have learned to hold for the long
term and to see price declines as transitory—and as buying oppor-
tunities.” Thus, they conclude that investors have learned that
diversified portfolios of stocks are not risky, that stocks are much more
valuable as investments than they had formerly thought. There-
fore they are now willing to pay much more for stocks. Because
of this increased investor demand for stocks, the stock market will
perpetually remain at a higher level in the future.11
Glassman and Hassett followed up these articles with a book,
Dow36,000: The New Strategy for Profiting from the Coming Rise in the
Stock Market.In it they stress that investors have not finished learn-
ing that diversified holdings of stocks are not risky and that they will
continue to bid up stock prices in coming years as the lesson really
sinks in. They claim that “Asensible target date for Dow 36,000 is
early 2005, but it could be reached much earlier.”12If this is true, one
has the opportunity to make a lotof money between 2000 and 2005,
or even sooner, by investing in stocks while investors at large are
still learning about the value of stocks. Despite the ostensible theme
of the book—that stocks are so riskless that they should be thought
of as interchangeable with government bonds—the sales pitch for
the book (as can be seen in its title) is actually that one can get rich

quick on the transition by investing in stocks now, while otherpeople
learn later that stocks are riskless.
Glassman and Hassett are right when they say that people are
considering the advantages of mutual funds, investing for the
long run, and the concept that stock price declines are transitory.
But one should not infer from this that people have learned or are
in the process of learning some essential truths. We have already
seen that stock price declines are not that transitory, that they can
persist for decades, and thus that even long-run investors should
see risk in stock market investments. There is also reason to believe
that much of the enthusiasm for mutual funds is a sort of investor
fad that was not caused by any real learning.
Investors show great interest in choosing the right mutual fund,
and their interest in mutual funds often takes the form of switch-
ing from one to the next. In response to this heightened investor inter-
est, the mutual fund industry has spawned thousands of new
funds, with a corresponding proliferation of ads and mailings. Yet
studies of mutual fund performance have found that although
there is some tendency for mutual funds that have done well to con-
tinue to do so, the tendency is weak and short-lived. People appear
to believe that it is smart to pore over rankings of mutual fund per-
formance and constantly shift their investments to the current top
performers, but in fact they gain relatively little by doing so.13
To assess investors’ feelings that they can make money in the stock
market, and the role that mutual funds play in this process, I
included in a 1996 questionnaire survey of individual investors a
sequence of questions about their confidence levels for both invest-
ing in general and investing in mutual funds. The questions, and
the percentage responses for each answer, were as follows:
Trying to time the stock market, to get out before it goes down and
to get in before it goes up, is:
1. Asmart thing to try to do; I can reasonably
expect to be a success at it. 11%
2. Not a smart thing to try to do; I can’t
reasonably expect to be a success at it. 83%
3. No opinion. 5%
[Number of respondents: 131]

INVESTOR LEARNING—AND UNLEARNING 199
Trying to pick individual stocks, trying to predict, for example, if
and when Ford Motor stock will go up or IBM stock will go up, is:
1. Asmart thing to try to do; I can reasonably
expect to be a success at it. 40%
2. Not a smart thing to try to do; I can’t
reasonably expect to be a success at it. 51%
3. No opinion. 8%
[Number of respondents: 131]
Trying to pick mutual funds, trying to figure out which funds have
experts who can themselves pick stocks that will go up, is:
1. Asmart thing to try to do; I can reasonably
expect to be a success at it. 50%
2. Not a smart thing to try to do; I can’t
reasonably expect to be a success at it. 27%
3. No opinion. 23%
[Number of respondents: 132]
From these results, we see that people effectively believe in the
efficiency of the aggregate market and so have given up on timing
it; but they often think that they can still pick individual stocks and
(particularly) mutual funds. Only 27% will say that trying to pick
mutual funds that will do well is not a smart thing to do to, com-
pared with 51% who say that trying to pick individual stocks and
83% who say that trying to time the market are not smart things
to do.
If one truly believed in efficient markets, then one would reply
“not a smart thing to try to do” to allthese questions. If stock prices
are a random walk, then one cannot pick times to enter the mar-
ket, one cannot pick individual stocks, and one cannot pick others
who will pick them.
Since there is only modest evidence that one can in fact be a
success at picking mutual funds, what investors have “learned”
has little support in fact. And in any case, should it really be eas-
ier to pick managers of mutual funds than managers of individ-
ual companies?
It is often said that people have learned about the importance
of portfolio diversification and are using mutual funds to achieve
this.14Given well-managed funds with low management fees, this

==================================================

200 ATTEMPTS TO RATIONALIZE EXUBERANCE
argument makes some sense. But many funds charge such high fees
that investors might be better off trying to achieve diversification
themselves, if diversification were the primary investment motive.
Moreover, when they are investing outside a tax-free environ-
ment, by holding stocks directly investors can avoid capital gains
taxes on the gains the mutual fund managers realize when they sell
stocks in the funds’ portfolios, an important issue with higher-
turnover funds. Investors can instead realize, for tax purposes, the
losses on the stocks that go down. Mutual funds clearly have
their limitations.
Learning and Unlearning
The public is said to have learned that stocks always go right
back up after they go down. We have seen evidence that they do
largely think this, but that they have gotten their facts wrong. Stocks
can go down, and stay down for many years. They can become
overpriced and underperform for many years.
The public is said to have learned that stocks must always out-
perform other investments, such as bonds, over the long run, and
so long-run investors will always do better in stocks. We have seen
evidence that they do largely think this. But again they have got-
ten their facts wrong. Stocks have not always outperformed other
investments over decades-long intervals, and there is certainly no
reason to think they must in the future.
And the public is said to have learned about the wisdom of
investing in stocks via mutual funds whose management teams
have proven track records. We find that they do largely think this,
and once more they are wrong. Picking mutual funds that have
done well has much smaller benefits than investors imagine.
When the facts are wrong, it can’t be called learning. Someday,
investors will “unlearn” these “facts.” But before this happens, we
must consider what we as individuals and as a society should be
doing—a critical issue to which we turn in the final chapter.

Eleven
Speculative Volatility in a Free Society
The high recent valuations in the
stock market have come about
for no good reasons. The market level does not, as so many imag-
ine, represent the consensus judgment of experts who have care-
fully weighed the long-term evidence. The market is high because
of the combined effect of indifferent thinking by millions of people,
very few of whom feel the need to perform careful research on the
long-term investment value of the aggregate stock market, and who
are motivated substantially by their own emotions, random atten-
tions, and perceptions of conventional wisdom. Their all-too-
human behavior is heavily influenced by news media that are
interested in attracting viewers or readers, with limited incentive
to discipline their readers with the type of quantitative analysis that
might give them a correct impression of the aggregate stock mar-
ket level.
It is a serious mistake for public figures to acquiesce in the
stock market valuations we have seen recently, to remain silent
about the implications of such high valuations, and to leave all com-
mentary to the market analysts who specialize in the nearly impos-
sible task of forecasting the market over the short term and who

share interests with investment banks or brokerage firms. The
valuation of the stock market is an important national—indeed
international—issue.All of our plans for the future, as individu-
als and as a society, hinge on our perceived wealth, and plans can
be thrown into disarray if much of that wealth evaporates tomor-
row. The tendency for speculative bubbles to grow and then con-
tract can make for very uneven distribution of wealth. It may even
cause many of us, at times, to question the very viability of our cap-
italist and free market institutions. It is for such reasons that we
must be clear on the prospect for such contractions and on what
should be our individual and national policy regarding this prospect.
Of course, in the current political and economic climate one incurs
a substantial risk of embarrassment if one goes on record saying
that stock market returns will be low or negative in coming years.
We have seen in this book that, although the market appears to have
substantial long-term forecastability when it is very overpriced (as
it appears to be, based on recent data) or, alternatively, when it is
very underpriced, there is always considerable uncertainty about
its outlook. But an observer who remains silent about the unjus-
tifiably high values because he or she could be wrong about the
outlook is no better than a doctor who, having diagnosed high blood
pressure in a patient, says nothing because the patient might be
lucky and show no ill effects. (Conversely, whether the stock mar-
ket falls or continues its upward climb in the opening years of the
twenty-first century will neither prove nor disprove this book’s
essential thesis about irrational exuberance.)
The Outlook at the Beginning of the New Millennium
Let us consider the twelve precipitating factors listed in Chapter 2
as the ultimate causes of the bull market in the closing years of the
twentieth century, factors such as the Internet, the decline of foreign
economic rivals, and the Baby Boom. Which of these factors are likely
not only to persist but to become even stronger—even more sup-
portive of a high market than they have been recently?
If the precipitating factors continue to support the market at its
recent record level, and do not increase the market’s value further,

SPECULATIVE VOLATILITY IN A FREE SOCIETY 205
then returns in the stock market will be confined to dividends. Since
the dividend-price ratio in the U.S. stock market has been only a
little above 1% recently, given stable market levels, stock market
returns would be limited to about 1% per year—a very poor return
indeed. We need further growth in these supportive factors to obtain
even historically average returns on the market.1
Acouple of the twelve factors that I listed in Chapter 2 appear
likely to grow in importance in the opening years of the twenty-
first century. These factors might work in the direction of causing
stock prices to increase substantially. In this case, of course—and
if, as in the recent past, dividends do not increase apace—then the
dividend yield on stocks will sink even lower, making the longer-
run sustainability of the market level even more questionable.
Recall that it was argued that the Internet is one of the most
visible of humankind’s inventions, in that individuals themselves
directly participate in it and find it opening new horizons for them.
Participation in the Internet gives people a personal sense of tech-
nological progress, and this personal participation may give them
an exaggerated sense of the promise of the technology—exagger-
ated at least in terms of the outlook for the existing companies
thatcompose the bulk of the value of the stock market. The Inter-
net is expected to grow quite a bit. According to International Data

passed100 million in late 1999, and the number is predicted to
rise to 177million individuals by 2003. Worldwide, the number of
users is expected to grow from 142 million in 1998 to 502 million
by 2003.2Eventually probably almost everyone will be using the
Internet, and thus one might think that the psychological support
for high market levels would be strongly enhanced.
However, the effect of further growth in the Internet might be
less dramatic than the predictions of millions of new users would
at first suggest. Potential new users have already heard about the
Internet. It has been advertised everywhere, and so it will not be
news to them. As we pass the year 2001 and move into the third
millennium, the festive parade of displays and forecasts of futur-
istic technology will move on, and the Internet will inevitably
receive less publicity. In any case, the wealthier people who are more

likely to invest in the stock market are already likely to have Inter-
net connections. And the symbolic value of the Net will probably
itself fade just because we become accustomed to it. As time goes
on, the Internet may seem less and less a symbol of the promise
of new technology, and more and more like the phone book. Nev-
ertheless, the future growth of the Internet is still likely to offer some
boost to the market.
The enormous growth of opportunities to trade stocks easily and
cheaply is also likely to continue, with the expansion of online trad-
ing of stocks, the creation of new electronic stock and derivative
exchanges, and the implementation of twenty-four-hour trading.
According to one forecast, the number of U.S. households with online
investing accounts is predicted to increase from 3.1 million in 1999
to 9.7 million in 2003.3Such changes, by encouraging increased activ-
ity in the market, will no doubt stimulate more and more people
to take an interest in the market. As discussed in Chapter 2, this
increase in interest may encourage higher market valuations—
although the certainty of such an impetus is far from definite.
Other factors I described in Chapter 2 are likely to remain stable,
not grow further, in their support of high market value. Such new
media institutions as the business channels on cable television and
the “Money” sections in newspapers will undoubtedly persist, but
it is hard to imagine a doubling in the number of such channels or
pages relative to others. The critical question is whether the current
level of public attention to them can be sustained over time. It was
public response that accounted in part for the expanded media cov-
erage we have already seen. Based on the historical precedents we
considered in Chapter 3, the focal point of the news may shift some-
what over time, away from investments. This shift of focus may
in turn alter the nature of these media in unpredictable ways. There
is a good chance that they may become less supportive of a cul-
ture of investing.
There is fundamental uncertainty whether the really low rates
of inflation we have seen of late can be expected to continue. By
some accounts, the burst of inflation due to the high-pressure eco-
nomic measures initiated in the 1960s in the United States (as well
as other countries) was itself an anomaly, the only sharp peacetime

inflation in U.S. history, and is unlikely to be repeated now that we
have seen its consequences. However, there has been no funda-
mental change in our institutions since then, and it is hard to rule
out a resurgence of inflation.An oil shortage or a war, to pick just
two examples, might have that effect, as they have in the past.
For now, continuation of lower inflation appears a likely prospect,
and continuing low inflation will continue to promote low nominal
yields on fixed-income investments and thus encourage high val-
uations on stocks. One thing that is fairly certain is that inflation
will not get significantly lower: no monetary authority is likely to
permit substantially negative inflation rates. Thus low inflation is
at best a stable factor, not a factor whose scope is likely to increase,
encouraging further growth of the stock market.
The rise of public institutions promoting gambling appears
unlikely to be reversed, unless some dramatic scandal or catastrophe
turns public opinion against them. I have argued that the promi-
nence of gambling institutions in our culture may encourage a spec-
ulative stance in financial markets. But what this means for the
outlook for the market is highly uncertain, for the theoretical con-
nection is admittedly weak.
Others among the factors I mentioned as supporting a high
market valuation are quite likely to falter in the future. The effects
of the post–World War II Baby Boom on the stock market are cer-
tain to become less pronounced over time. Barring an unforeseen
event, such as the outbreak of a previously unknown disease that
selectively kills the elderly, we know that there will be many more
retired persons in 2030 than there are today. Thanks to improved
medical technology, retirees will be living on in a state of increased
dependency, and they will need to cash in their stock market
investments to support themselves. Of course, as argued earlier,
the ultimate meaning of this effect is clouded by uncertainty about
fundamental economic growth and foreign demand for U.S. stocks.
Still, the strong public perception that the Baby Boom supports the
stock market will eventually fade.
It is sometimes thought that government reaction to the Baby
Bust might be a reason to expect a boost in the stock market,
instead of a fall. For example, President Clinton, in his 1999 State

of the Union Address, proposed that over the next fifteen years
$2.7trillion of the projected federal surplus should be reserved for
the Social Security Trust Fund and that about a quarter of that
$2.7trillion should be invested in the stock market. If a plan sim-
ilar to this one is eventually adopted, it could represent a modest
boost to the demand for stocks (compared to the $16 trillion value
of the stock market) over the intermediate term. Of course, it is hard
to say how much of this future demand for stocks has already been
incorporated into market expectations and thus already reflected
in share prices, and also to what extent government purchases
ofstocks for Social Security will be offset by declining individual
purchases. It is also hard to know when such a boost would affect
the market, and the government’s policy would not prevent the
ultimate decline in demand for stocks when the Boomers finally
retire.
The sense of “victory” of capitalist economies that developed after
some of our close competitors abroad began to falter after 1990 is
not likely to persist indefinitely. No sports team comes out on top
season after season. New symbolic losses here or gains there are to
be expected as foreign economies make necessary course corrections.
What then is the rough scorecard for the likely future of the
twelveprecipitating factors in the opening years of the twenty-first
century? Two (the Internet boom and the expansion of stock trad-
ing opportunities) will probably increase in strength, two (the Baby
Boom and perceived victory over foreign economic rivals) will de-
crease, and the others will likely stay about the same. The conclusion
is that no overall change in these twelve factors can be confidently
predicted,and that, if constancy of the precipitating factors implies
constancyof the market level, then returns will remain confined
to the low dividend yield we now see for stocks.
Yet the absence of predictable change in the overall impact of
these factors does not suggest that there will be no predictable
change in the market. The market levelgot where it is substantially
because of the increased influence of these precipitating factors in
the past, with the support of the feedback mechanisms discussed
in Chapter 3. Media publicity for the stock market (whose impor-
tance for market levels was argued in Chapter 4) was encouraged

by the price increases due to these factors and by the newness of
the factors themselves.
Without further growth in the precipitating factors in the open-
ing decade or so of the twenty-first century, the market will have
more and more trouble sustaining its present level. As time goes
on, excitement for the market will likely fade. As time goes on, the
culture of investing will likely fade. As time goes on, the sense that
one is “playing with the house money” will likely fade. As time
goes on, people will likely turn to other interests besides investing,
and the attention to the “new era” theories discussed in PartII will
likely fade. As time goes on, people’s attention will likely switch
to new psychological anchors for the market, and new conventional
wisdom and new public attentions will develop (as discussed in
Part III). All of these changes suggest a poor long-run outlook for
the stock market.
Possible New Factors
We should not dwell exclusively on the precipitating factors of the
past. New precipitating factors, both supportive and destructive
of market value, will no doubt develop, although it is difficult to
anticipate what these will be. There is little public discussion of such
possible new factors precisely because there is so little concrete to
say about them now. In the public’s imagination, future develop-
ments, at least as expressed in the media, seem largely confined
to the realm of new technology, and then the coverage is generally
upbeat.
Yet at a point in history where the U.S. economy has been rel-
atively strong, it is useful to recall the kinds of things that could
go wrong with economic growth and the growth of corporate
earnings—things that have interrupted past spells of strong earn-
ings growth and that could do so in the future.The kind of earnings
growth the United States has seen since the recession of 1991 requires
that all systems remain go, that there be no significant obstacles, and
in this respect we have indeed been quite fortunate of late.
The list of factors that could potentially interrupt earnings
growth is of course very long. We may list some of them, with no

presumption that any of these is more or less likely at the present
time: a decline in consumer demand, a dearth of new development
opportunities, failures of major technological initiatives, heightened
foreign competition, a resurgent labor movement, an oil crisis, a
corporate tax increase, newly discovered problems with the longer-
run consequences of downsizing and incentive-based compensa-
tion for employees, a decline in employee morale and productivity,
a war (even one among foreign countries, which disrupts our
own trade or destroys a stable environment for economic opera-
tions), a terrorist attack or even a new terrorist threat that hampers
business activities, an industrial accident that suggests that certain
technical processes are more dangerous than previously thought,
heightened regulatory or antitrust activity, increased foreign tar-
iffs or import quotas, a depression abroad, stricter environmental
standards, class-action lawsuits against corporations, a suddenly
erratic monetary policy, systemic problems due to a failure of major
banks or financial institutions, a widespread computer system
problem in the same vein as the once-predictedY2K-related mal-
functions or an unstoppable computer virus or communications
satellite problems, large-scale weather problems, natural disasters,
epidemics. . . . The list can never be complete. Indeed, some of
theitems on this list were virtually unknown a decade ago.
With so many possible causes, we are left now, as always, with
the daunting problem of assessing not only their various proba-
bilities—each of them by itself small and hard to quantify—but also
the probabilities of several of them happening together, which
would make the combined effect all the more serious. There are
important reasons to think that various of these problems would
tend to occur together, as one tends to precipitate others through
its effects on society and the economy. Indeed, the recent Asian
financial crisis was described in these terms, as due to the confluence
of a number of independent factors: a drop in confidence among
foreign investors in the Asian economies, an exchange rate crisis,
a banking crisis, a stock market decline, and crises of revealed gov-
ernment corruption. These separate crises fed on each other; they
were not independent factors in causing the ultimate financial
meltdown.

Issues of Fairness and Resentment
Many of the potential causes of earnings reversals listed earlier have
ultimately to do with changes in morale, loyalty, and sense of
fairness among the investing public. Currently, overt resentment
byAmerican citizens of their own corporations appears to be at a
historic low. Businessmen are lionized, and labor unions are very
weak by historical standards. But the growing unevenness of income
distribution, and the increasingly frequent stories of fabulous
wealth earned by the dealmakers, may turn U.S. public opinion
away from its pro-business stance.
According to calculations by economist Ray Fair, if market
expectations for earnings growth are realized, and if U.S. gross
domestic product growth is 4% a year, then after-tax corporate prof-
its as a fraction of gross domestic product will be over 12% in 2010,
a value almost twice as high as it has been at any time since 1948.4
It is hard to imagine that so high a fraction of gross domestic
product going to corporate profits will be tolerated by the public
without at least some resentment. It was such resentment of busi-
ness that ended the “community of interest” boom after 1901 (see
Chapter 5), by spurring vigorous antitrust legislation and regulation
of corporations, and it was such resentment after 1929, in encour-
aging the growth of Socialist and Communist movements, that
created an unusually uncertain and unstable atmosphere for the
economy in the 1930s (see Chapter 5).
Resentment by foreigners toward the United States is another
potential limiting factor for U.S. earnings growth.American dom-
inance in high-technology is highly visible around the world. In
recent years, numerous stories of American enterprise successes have
been flaunted in the faces of people outside the United States. For
example, the Internet is a symbol for much that is new and excit-
ing today in technology, and it is U.S. software companies that seem
to dominate it, from Web browsers to search engines to online
providers.All over the world the name of an American company,
Microsoft, appears on computer screens whenever people start
up Windows to access the Internet. Does this not leave people in
other countries with a sense of exclusion from this technology?

==================================================

212 A CALL TO ACTION
Something may seem fundamentally unfair about the United
States’ high-tech hegemony. How did Microsoft attain such over-
whelming dominance? Whether true or not, the company is often
described as cutthroat and grasping. Why is the Internet dominated
by the United States? The World Wide Web was after all a European
invention, developed in its initial form by a British and a Belgian
scientist, working in a Swiss laboratory. We do not see their names
when we start up our computers.
Resentment against the United States and its strong free enter-
prise system has moral overtones too; people in many other countries
that are not quite as strong economically wonder if their relative
lack of economic success might not be due to their greater concern
as societies and as individuals with equity, fairness, and human
values. If such a moral basis for resentment gains solid ground in
public thinking, it could lead to heightened efforts to compete with
or exclude American corporations.
Demonstrating another aspect of its high-tech dominance, the
United States deployed its superior military technology in Kosovo
in 1999, as it had in the Persian Gulf in 1991. It showed an ability
and willingness to use its technology to kill large numbers of people
with impunity, since it faced virtually no losses of its own. China’s
outrage against the United States after the accidental bombing of
its embassy in Belgrade is illustrative of foreign reaction.
In the Asian financial crisis, it was the United States that was
described as presenting a model for the faltering Asian economies
to follow. The economists who were sent to offer advice were
often U.S. trained. Although the basic intent was constructive,
these actions too had some negative symbolic value.
Increased resentment against U.S. corporations both domesti-
cally and abroad could result in increases in the probability of occur-
rence of certain of the events listed earlier as threats to earnings
growth. Resentment is not a word in most financial economists’
vocabulary, but it has been a powerful force in history.
Sharing the Limits to Growth
As the world develops, the level of atmosphere-polluting emissions
will also grow. The level of concern with the adverse effects of these

emissions has been such that the 1997 Kyoto Protocol proposed that
thirty-eight industrially advanced countries of the world cut emis-
sions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by an average
of 5.2% of 1990 levels during the period from 2008 to 2012.
Economists have estimated that full implementation of the
Kyoto Protocol without modification could result in an economic
cost with a present value of $1.5 trillion, borne mainly by wealthy
countries.5But the pain that would be caused by international efforts
to control emissions could be greater still. By some accounts, the
reductions proposed by the Kyoto Protocol are not nearly enough
to deal with the problems of greenhouse gas emissions. In 1995 the
United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
called for greenhouse emissions to be cut immediately by 50–70%.
But instead the level of emissions has continued to grow rapidly,
with most of the increase coming from the developing countries.
It is impossible to predict the ultimate cost to individuals and
corporations of efforts to reduce emissions or to deal with other
global limits to growth. However, considering the inevitable
conflicts as less-developed countries try to follow the path of de-
veloped countries, thus multiplying environmental problems, the
kind of enormous earnings growth in the future that would justify
recent stock market levels seems less likely.
These considerations of international resentment of the suc-
cess of wealthy economies and of the limits to growth only rein-
force our supposition that the current outlook for the stock market
is not favorable.
What Should Investors Do Now?
If over some interval in the first decade or so of the twenty-first
century the U.S. stock market is going to follow an uneven course
down, as well it might—back, let us say, to its levels in the mid-
1990s or even lower—then individuals, foundations, college
endowments, and other beneficiaries of the market are going to find
themselves poorer, in the aggregate by trillions of dollars. The real
losses could be comparable to the total destruction of all the
schools in the country, or all the farms in the country, or possibly
even all the homes in the country.6

One could say that such a fall would really be harmless, since
nothing is physically destroyed by a fall in stock market values;
it is only a change on paper and in our minds. One could say that
if the market were to fall by half it would only bring us back to
where we were a few years ago in terms of market value. But there
is the problem that the loss will not be borne equally. Some who
rode the market up to new prosperity will have lightened up on
their stock holdings and will keep their gains; others will have
recently entered the market and will take only the losses. Thus a
substantial fall in the market would leave some people really
poor while leaving others very rich.
We can imagine the effects on the lives of those people who had
become too dependent on stocks as investments, and too optimistic
regarding the performance of those investments in the future.
People who have put away only a modest amount in the stock
market for their children’s college education may find that their
savings are inadequate, that the real value of the portfolio has fallen
far short of the increased cost of a college education. The children
may have to take out substantial student loans and get unrewarding
part-time jobs to pay for their college education. Or they may de-
cide to choose a shorter career route, forgoing the dream of a
career in medicine, law, or other professions. They may decide not
to go to college at all.
Others, a little older, may find that their careers or ambitions are
thwarted. With fewer economic resources at their disposal, the need
to maintain an income level and fulfill everyday obligations will
consume time and energy they had hoped to devote to individual
fulfillment.
People who have saved virtually nothing for their retirement
because of their faith in the stock market investments in their
pension plans may find that the plans, along with Social Security,
simply do not provide them with a very comfortable standard of
living in their retirement. The “amazing power” of compound
returns that has become such an article of faith among so many
people does not apply if the returns are not there in the first place.
Thus those with little savings will have to fend for themselves in
a world with many more dependent elderly relative to the young.

They may have to live very simply—and that may mean sitting
athome.
Colleges and foundations with endowments heavily invested
in stocks may find that their ability to pursue their missions has
suddenly been curtailed. Consider, as an example, the Ford Foun-
dation, which published an influential report in 1969, near the peak
of the stock market, that strongly suggested that educational
endowments should be invested more in stocks to take advantage
of their high returns. The foundation took its own advice on
investing.After the 1974 stock market crash, it lost so much in the
stock market that its endowment fell from $4.1 billion to $1.7 bil-
lion. The foundation cut its annual grants from $177 million in 1973
to $76 million in 1979. Although it continued to support antipoverty
programs, the foundation sharply curtailed grants to universities
for research, to scholarly exchange programs, and to the arts. The
University of Rochester, which had been praised in the 1969 report
for its aggressive stance to the stock market, took a similar hit; it
lost over half its endowment between 1973 and 1974.7The same
or worse could happen today to foundations and universities that
have invested too large a share of their portfolios in the stock
market.
So what should investors do now? The natural first step may be,
depending on current holdings and specific circumstances, to
reduce holdings of U.S. stocks. Certainly, the commonsense notion
that one should not be overly dependent on any one investment is
as true as ever now. One should at the very least diversify thoroughly.
But there is fundamental difficulty with advising individuals
and institutions to get out of the stock market. If such advice
were suddenly taken by large numbers, it would cause an imme-
diate drop in the level of the market. In fact, we cannot allget out
of the market. We can only sell our shares to someone else. Some-
body must be left holding the outstanding shares.As a group, those
unfortunate people who bought in at a market high have already
made their mistake, and we cannot correct it for them as a group
after the fact.
So an important action that all investors can take now is to
decrease their reliance on the stock market in their ongoingeconomic

decisions. Individuals should consider increasing their savings rates.
Foundations and colleges should consider reducing the payout rate
from their endowments.
The optimism represented by the high stock market has coin-
cided with a much lower personal savings rate in the United
States—in fact a personal savings rate of around zero. Most sav-
ing in the United States today is corporate (in the form of retained
earnings) and governmental (in the form of the federal surplus),
forms of saving whose beneficiaries are not distributed equally over
the population.
It is reasonable to suppose that the stock market at some point
in the first decade of the twenty-first century will decline in value
by an amount on the order of one year’s national income. The
amountof additional personal saving that must be done to offset
this decline is quite large. For example, if we are to offset by addi-
tional saving such a decline in ten years’ time, without the advan-
tages of supposedly high rates of return and high compounding,
then we will have to be saving on the order of an additional 10%
of our pretax incomes each year.
For the same reason, colleges and foundations with endowment
funds invested in the market should consider, when possible,
substantially lowering their payout rates. This conclusion stands
in sharp contrast to some recent recommendations about endow-
ment payout rates. For example, the National Network of Grant-
makers, an organization of progressive foundations, issued a report
in 1999 urging all foundations to increase their payout from the 5%
of assets mandated by U.S. law to 6%.8Universities, whose endow-
ments are growing rapidly thanks to the strong stock market and
associated alumni giving, are being urged to increase their spend-
ing. For endowments heavily exposed to stock market risks, these
recommendations are pointing in the wrong direction.
Retirement Plans
The growth since the bottom of the market in 1982 of employer-
sponsored defined contribution pension plans (in which the com-



==================================================

pany makes contributions to an investment fund that is owned by
the employee), in contrast to older defined benefit plans (in which
the company guarantees specified pension benefits to the employee
upon retirement), has marked a shift away from a notion of shared
responsibility for the elderly toward a feeling that each person is
responsible for his or her own welfare. These 401(k) and similar
plans are designed to give ordinary people economic security in
retirement by encouraging them to mimic the portfolio strategies
long pursued by the wealthy. But little attention is usually paid to
the fact that the wealthy, because of the overall level of their assets,
have less reason to worry about losing substantial amounts in a
market decline.
The shift toward defined contribution pension plans has in many
respects been a good thing, since the older defined benefit plans
were usually not indexed to inflation (an odd and hard-to-explain
lapse in public judgment, and one that does not inspire confidence
that people are better off letting institutional experts manage their
investments for them).9People who retired and lived a long time
under defined benefit plans often saw a substantial part of the real
value of their pensions eroded away by inflation.
But even though the switch to defined contribution plans elim-
inated this problem, something was lost in the transition, namely
a sense of group responsibility for the standard of living of pen-
sioners. Properly designed defined benefit plans are risk-managing
institutions for pensioners, and as such would offer risk-reducing
advantages, which are particularly important for lower-income pen-
sioners. Now participants in pension plans are told, in effect,
choose your investments (for the pension contributions) and take
your chances. As we have seen, they are typically given a large num-
ber of choices, including many varieties of stock market investments,
and thus (as discussed in Chapter 2) there is a not-so-subtle nudge
in the direction of investing heavily in the stock market.
Plans that offer the choice of investment in the government’s
inflation-indexed bonds are a rarity, despite the fact that these bonds
have recently been yielding about 4% a year and are riskless.
These bonds would be an obvious choice for people planning for

retirement, a far better option today than the stock market. Their
advantages would be particularly significant for low-income people.
Andyet there is little leadership on the part of employers or gov-
ernment to encourage them to shift their retirement funds into the
bonds or to make it possible to include them in their 401(k) plans.
The current institutional structure does not encourage employers to
exert leadership through their plans, only to provide the standard
options that other plans offer, always involving the stock market.
Furthermore the plan investments that participants choose are
not well diversified. In the early 1990s, most 401(k) balances were
invested in guaranteed investment contracts (GICs), fixed-income
investments offered by insurance companies, not indexed to infla-
tion. The reputation of GICs was tarnished by a couple of defaults
in the early 1990s, which revealed that they were not really guar-
anteed. These coincided with a barrage of publicity suggesting that
experts agreed that people did not put enough into the stock mar-
ket. Since then, the trend in participant allocations has been sharply
away from GICs, in favor of the stock market. According to the lat-
est Investment Company Institute/Employee Benefits Research
Institute study, more than two-thirds of 401(k) pension plan bal-
ances were in the stock market in 1996.10Even among participants
nearing retirement, participants in their sixties, most of the plan
balances were in the stock market. If the trend toward favoring the
stock market for 401(k) investments has continued since 1996, the
fraction of plan balances in the market today will be even higher.
Many participants no doubt put virtually all of their pension
funds into the stock market.11
Because so large a proportion of 401(k) investments is in the stock
market, a sharp market decline would have important conse-
quences for many retirees.Adecline of the stock market to less than
half its recent value is not improbable. Given the meagerness of
most Social Security benefits, and given that most retirees have little
more than their pension plan, their house, and their Social Secu-
rity benefits, these declines would indeed be noticed.12
And yet there is a curious lack of public concern about this risk.
Few are raising alarms about it. If anything, concerns are expressed
that some plan participants are not putting enough into the stock

market, and are thereby missing out on obviously good investments
because of an excess of conservatism.
Managers of 401(k) plans generally do not offer advice to employ-
ees about how they should make their allocations. Until a Labor
Department ruling in 1996, it was in fact legally difficult for the plans
to offer any advice because of potential liability concerns.13Now plans
will sometimes warn participants of the importance of diversifica-
tion, but as we have seen these warnings are weak and have little
effect. The general stance of public policy has been to respect com-
pletely participants’ own choices, as if people have their own good
reasons for putting so much into the stock market, or as if their judg-
ments are related to purely personal matters rather than popular-
culture myths about surefire profit opportunities in stocks.
The current policy of providing a menu of choices for partic-
ipants without any strongly worded advice to diversify invites seri-
ous errors. But the current attitude toward the market puts pension
plans under pressure to provide people with what they want
andnot to act paternally. Ultimately it is government policy that
has fostered this situation, by encouraging defined contribution
pension plans rather than encouraging the improvement, through
indexation, of defined benefit pension plans.
Authorities who are responsible for pension plans (in the busi-
nesses that sponsor them or in the plans themselves) should come
out much more strongly against putting all or almost all of one’s
plan balance into the stock market. They should instead recommend
greater diversification and suggest that a substantial fraction of bal-
ances be put into safe investments, such as inflation-indexed gov-
ernment bonds. They should make available inflation-indexed
retirement annuities and urge retirees to take their retirement
income in this form. It may even be a good move, particularly for
lower-income workers, for corporate pension plans to move back
toward defined benefit plans, if these plans are appropriately
indexed and vested. The indexation could be in terms of the Con-
sumer Price Index, per capita national income, or a mixture of the
two.14In the future, as a greater variety of risk management con-
tracts become available, advice should be given to employees to
take advantage of them.

220 A CALL TO ACTION
Social Security
As of this writing, a number of proposals have been advanced to
invest at least a portion of the Social Security Trust Fund in the
stock market. Having marveled at the high returns in the market,
Americans are wondering why they have earned so much lower
a return on their contributions to Social Security than they could
have earned in a defined contribution pension plan, and why they
have not been allowed to invest their contributions in the stock
market. If the government were to implement fully such propos-
als, it would compromise another important national risk-sharing
institution.
We may regard the Social Security system as the government’s
partial assumption of the intrafamily risk sharing of long ago. Young
people have long felt a sense of obligation to care for their aging
parents, in return for the care they received as children. Thus
middle-aged people often found themselves caring simultane-
ously for their elderly parents as well as their children. Since the
precise obligations were dictated by morals and feelings of love
rather than legal bonds, this old family system encouraged some
effective intergenerational risk sharing. One divided up one’s
attentions between one’s dependent children and elderly parents
as one perceived their relative needs and one’s own needs, not by
some contract formula. If the elderly were more in need of care,
sicker, or more dependent, or lived longer, they received propor-
tionally greater share of family resources, and the converse also
applied. In this way, risks were shared across generations.
The problem with the family as an economic risk-sharing insti-
tution is that it is unreliable. Members may die young or become
incapacitated or irresponsible at the age when they should be doing
the work for others. Social Security was created to alleviate such
problems by replacing individual “contracts” among family mem-
bers with contractual obligations between generations at large.
In the United States (as in the systems of many other countries),
Social Security is primarily a pay-as-you-go system: the contri-
butions made by working people are not invested in any real assets
but are given immediately to those retirees who need the money

now. In this way, Social Security mimics the traditional family sys-
tem, which also did not rely on any investments. Indeed, the tra-
ditional family system did not rely on investments to prepare for
old age because in most times and places there were few reliable
investments to use to save over decade-long intervals. Now, with
the exaggerated public confidence in the market, we seem to think
that there are such investments—in stocks. In fact, we are closer
to the old situation than is widely realized. Stocks are not safe.
Although individuals in the United States and some other countries
can invest in inflation-indexed bonds, which are completely safe
investments, these indexed bonds are not investments for society
as a whole, since their net value is zero. The indexed government
bonds are made safe only by the fact that taxpayers guarantee their
payments. There is no safe investment for the country as a whole
because there are so many things that can go wrong with an econ-
omy. If the economy takes a bad turn and national income declines,
then the working population will see their tax rates go up to pay
for the fixed Social Security benefits guaranteed to retirees, and thus
they will experience an amplified effect of the economic decline.
It does not make sense to protect one segment of the population
from any economic setback by concentrating the effects of the
setback on another segment.
The creation of Social Security in the United States in the 1930s
is often described as having provided a windfall to the first gen-
eration of benefit recipients, who received much more in benefits
than could be justified by the contributions they themselves had
made. But there has been no clear windfall to them, since one must
also take account of the decline in obligations that was felt within
families to care for them, when families saw that they were being
taken care of by the government. The first generation’s “windfall
gain” was probably offset by reduced levels of care from their chil-
dren. Their children were paying into Social Security instead of
putting time and effort into caring for their parents. In this way,
the Social Security system merely took charge of part of the care
young people had been giving to their parents, without changing
its substance, and with the advantage of greater uniformity and
reliability.

==================================================

222 A CALL TO ACTION
Offsetting this advantage of Social Security, however, is the loss
of the sense of balance between the needs of the generations. These
are now dealt with in a formulaic manner, argued about in
abstract terms in Congress without the immediate evidence of rel-
ative needs that is so visible within the family. There is limited
ability for national debate to come to grips with the relative
needs and abilities of the generations, and so the family contin-
ues to function as the premier intergenerational risk-management
institution.
It would be a serious mistake to adopt the policy, proposed by
some, of replacing the current Social Security system with a
defined contribution plan for retirement, investing plan balances
in the stock market, or even a plan that would give individuals a
choice of investment categories. Such a plan would replace the
current societal commitments to the elderly with a hope that finan-
cial markets will do as well as in the past. Adopting such a plan
at a time when the market is at a record high relative to funda-
mentals would be an error of historic proportions. Fortunately most
serious proposals have called for only modest investments of the
Social Security Trust Fund in the stock market.15
Reform of Social Security should take the form not of investing
the trust fund in the stock market but of making the system more
responsive to economic risks, so that the system promotes better
risk sharing among economic groups within our population. Con-
tribution rates and benefit rates should vary over time depending
on the relative needs of workers and retirees. Both contributions and
benefits should be indexed, but not primarily to the Consumer Price
Index, rather to per capita national income. We must reform the
Social Security system in the direction of making it more like a sys-
tem that would seem just and humane were it to be implemented
within a family—a system that shares risk and that does not leave
anyone bearing an inordinate share of the economic burden.16
Monetary Policy and Speculative Bubbles
There have been occasions on which tightened monetary policy was
associated with the bursting of stock market bubbles. For example,

                     PAGE 246                     
==================================================

SPECULATIVE VOLATILITY IN A FREE SOCIETY 223
on February 14, 1929, the Federal Reserve raised the rediscount rate
from 5% to 6% for the ostensible purpose of checking speculation.
In the early 1930s, the Fed continued the tight monetary policy and
saw the initial stock market downturn evolve into the deepest stock
market decline ever, and a recession into the most serious U.S.
depression ever.
In Japan, at the peak of the Japanese stock market between
May 1989 and August 1990, the Bank of Japan raised the discount
rate from 2.5% to 6%, ostensibly to stabilize financial markets
(which were thought to have become overpriced because of easy
monetary policy) and also to stabilize the yen. It is hard to dismiss
the possibility that this action by the bank played some role in the
stock market crash and severe recession that followed.17
Although the precise causal links are hard to disentangle even
in these dramatic episodes, one thing we do know about interest
rate policy is that it affects the entire economy in fundamental ways,
and that it is not focused exclusively on the speculative bubble it
might be used to correct. It is whole-body irradiation, not a sur-
gical laser. Moreover, the genesis of a speculative bubble, such as
the one we are in now, is a long, slow process, involving gradual
changes in people’s thinking. Small changes in interest rates will
not have any predictable effect on such thinking; big changes
might, but only because they have the potential to exert a devas-
tating impact on the economy as a whole.
The Great Depression of the 1930s was in fact substantially due
to monetary authorities’ trying to stabilize speculative markets
through interest rate policies, although the markets they were
focusing most on were not the stock markets but the markets for
their own currencies. Countries attempted to preserve the fixed
exchange rate system, represented by the gold standard, against
attacks. The countries that gave up earliest and abandoned their
efforts to defend their currencies were the ones to emerge from the
depression the soonest.18
A small, but symbolic, increase in interest rates by monetary
authorities at a time when markets are perceived by them to be
overpriced may be a useful step, if the increase is accompanied
by a public statement that it is intended to restrain speculation. But

authorities should not generally try to burst a bubble through
aggressive tightening of monetary policy.
The Stabilizing Authority of Opinion Leaders
Atime-honored way of restraining speculation in financial mar-
kets is for intellectual and moral leaders to try to call the attention
of the public to over- and underpricing errors when they occur. This
approach has been used repeatedly in the history of our financial
markets, albeit with a degree of success that is hard to judge.
During the 1907 stock market crash, which coincided with a bank-
ing panic in October, national financial leaders made public state-
ments expressing their confidence in the markets and stating that
they would risk their own wealth in them. John D. Rockefeller
said, “Personally, I have absolute faith in the future of the value
of our securities and the soundness of underlying conditions.” He
and J. P. Morgan set up a bankers’ pool to lend money to support
the banks. On Black Thursday, October 24, 1929, five of the
country’s most influential bankers met with Morgan and issued
a statement that they believed “the foundations of the market to
be sound.”19Although they did not announce specific plans to
buy stocks, their statement was interpreted as suggesting they
would. This attempt at stabilizing the market was not successful.
The stock market crash of October 28–29, 1929, occurred just a few
days later.
In each of the three major market peaks identified here that fol-
low the founding of the Federal Reserve—that is, the peaks of the
late 1920s, the mid-1960s, and the 1990s—the head of the Federal
Reserve System issued warnings that the stock market was over-
priced. The 1929 interest rate increase, discussed earlier, was
announced as being directed against speculation. The 1966 peak
of the U.S. stock market coincided roughly with a statement by Fed-
eral Reserve Chairman William McChesney Martin in 1965 that
hefound “disquieting similarities” between the economy then and
the economy during the 1920s prelude to the Great Depression. He
listed, as one of the similarities, the spreading conviction among
the public that “a new economic era” had begun.20Astatement

warning against stock market excesses by a Federal Reserve chair-
man was not made again until Alan Greenspan’s “irrational exu-
berance” speech in December 1996, that is, until the beginning of
the next period of very high market levels. It appears that Fed chair-
men reserve public statements about market pricing for periods
of extreme mispricing. There is no way to judge the success of such
rare statements in calming the markets, and we do not know how
volatile they would have been otherwise.
The trouble with such exercises of moral authority is that,
although views that the market is either very overpriced or very
underpriced may become commonplace among the experts, they
are never universally held. The leaders who make such statements
find themselves doing so based on personal opinion: an intuitive
judgment about the state of market fundamentals and psychology,
a judgment that is so hard to prove that they probably feel that it
takes an act of courage to make such a statement in the first place.
There probably is a role for such actions by opinion leaders, but
it is only a minor one. If they are genuinely disinterested in their
pronouncements and are perceived as true moral leaders, their pro-
nouncements may have a small stabilizing effect on the market.
Dealing with Bubbles by
Interrupting or Discouraging Trade
Another method for reducing market volatility has been to shut
down markets in times of rapid price change. The “circuit break-
ers” adopted by the stock exchanges are examples of this approach.
Under the New York Stock Exchange’s Rule 80B, whenever the Dow
Jones Industrial Average drops by 10% (recently this would have
corresponded to an absolute drop of 1,100 points) from the previous
daily close before 2 P.M., the market is to be shut down for one hour;
by 20% (2,250 points) before 1 P.M., for two hours; and by 30%
(3,350points) at any time of day, for the rest of the day. Such mar-
ket closings might have the effect of giving investors a cooling-off
period, to allow them to find time for reflection, and thereby stem-
ming panic. But it is not clear that these relatively short closings
do very much to restrain one-day price changes. After all, the two

biggest stock market crashes in history, the crashes of October 1929
and October 1987, occurred on Mondays, after the price declines
of the previous trading day had been interrupted by an entire
weekend.
Another example of a deliberate restraint of trade to prevent
bubbles is the uptick rule for short sales. The Securities and
Exchange Commission has long required of exchanges that short
sales be allowed only on an uptick, that is, only if the preceding
trade was on an increasing price.
Yet these various policies of closing the market, for a matter of
seconds, minutes, hours, or days, do not directly address the
longer-term price movements—movements that take place over
years—that represent the really big stock price shifts. It is plau-
sible that by concealing a large short-term price change from the
public eye we can head off public overreaction to that price change,
and so prevent a longer-term price trend from developing in
response to the vivid memory of a really large one-day change.
Dramatic one-day changes are attention grabbers, are given tremen-
dous hype by the media, and are remembered long afterward, espe-
cially if they set some kind of record. On the other hand, we really
have very little information about the effects of a policy of closing
markets for short periods of time on longer-term price changes.
What if a really large price change is corrected soon after by the
market itself,as was the October 1987 price change? Perhaps the
public’s experience of seeing a crash followed by a correction would
have a more stabilizing effect than the experience of having a
potential crash concealed from it by a market closing.
Longer cooling-off periods have been attempted; in fact the
NewYork Stock Exchange was closed for three months in 1914.21
However, because this long market closing is thus far unique in U.S.
history, no significant lessons can be drawn from the experience.
Other proposals have been advanced to slow the pace of trade
by discouraging frequent trading, that is, to “throw sand in the
wheels” of speculative markets. James Tobin, a colleague of mine
atYale University, has proposed that the speculative price move-
ments in the market for foreign currencies be restrained by levying
a transaction tax on them.22This proposal was extended to stocks



==================================================
                     PAGE 250

and to corporate and government bonds by Lawrence and Victoria
Summers, although Lawrence Summers has not advocated this idea
since assuming his current post as U.S. treasury secretary.23Secu-
rities transaction taxes are not a new concept, and they have been
used in this country as well as many others, although they have not
usually resulted from any clearly articulated theory of restraining
speculation.
The idea of such transaction taxes, as expressed by Tobin, is that
they will discourage short-run speculators in favor of investors con-
cerned with long-run fundamentals. Although he recognizes that
a transaction tax penalizes trades based on fundamentals as well
as those for speculative reasons, Tobin believes that the tax would
more often discourage the latter, since many speculators seem to
be interested in very-short-run transactions.
Tobin might be right that speculators will be rather more inhib-
ited by such a tax than long-term investors, since speculators appear,
based on survey data on their expectations, to extrapolate past price
changes primarily for short intervals. Jeffrey Frankel has found such
evidence from survey data on speculators in foreign exchange
markets.24 I have found from my survey data that institutional
investors in the stock market tend slightly more often to have
bubbleexpectations, in essence expecting an increase and then a
decrease in stock prices, when short-run (six-month) price increases
have recently been high.25But such a tendency for short-run expec-
tations to reinforce recent short-run price changes is actually fairly
weak, and we cannot be sure that it will continue in the future, since
speculators’ theories about markets are likely to change with time.
It is not clear whether the transaction tax would indeed encour-
age long-term investors over short-term speculators. We should rec-
ognize that some speculative trading is done infrequently, while
some trading based on information about fundamentals is done
frequently. Real estate markets, which are subject to much higher
transaction costs than stock markets, nevertheless seem to be vul-
nerable to speculative bubbles and crashes. Moreover, it has been
found that countries that impose higher transaction costs do not
have lower stock market volatility.26 On balance, although I feel
that there might be some merit in Tobin-style transaction taxes for

reducing speculative volatility, I have not found the case strong
enough to recommend any such action.
Dealing with Bubbles by Expanding or Encouraging Trade
In the interest of longer-run economic stability, it may be that the
best stabilizing influence on markets is to broaden them to allow
as many people to trade as often as possible, and to broaden the
scope of things traded on markets. This of course is just the oppo-
site of the proposals discussed in the previous section.
Given that speculative bubbles are heavily influenced by word-
of-mouth effects, by locally perceived values and information,
and by patriotic feeling, foreign investors are less likely to go along
with a bubble than are local investors, and they may even trade
in a way that would tend to offset it. For example, in 1989, when
the Japanese Nikkei index was at its peak, our questionnaire sur-
veys found that the average Japanese institutional investor expected
a 9.5% increase in the Nikkei in the following year, while U.S. insti-
tutional investors expected a 7.7% decrease in the Nikkei. Some-
thing about living in Japan encouraged very different feelings
about the market. Had U.S. investors, or other foreign investors,
been more prominent in Japanese markets all along, the Japa-
nese stock market overpricing might never have happened.27Thus,
more generally, broadening of markets by encouraging global
participation in them should often have the effect of averaging over
these disparate expectations and producing more stable market
prices.
We should not assume that any policy that stabilizes markets
from day to day is a good policy. Sudden price changes are prob-
ably not as bad, in terms of their impact on economic welfare, as
long-term continuation of mispricing or, even worse, as the devel-
opment of a speculative bubble that results in a worse crash in the
future.
Given that speculative bubbles tend to occur, their eventual
bursting may indeed be on balance a good thing. The Asian finan-
cial crisis of 1997–98, sparked by the withdrawal of world investors

fromAsian markets, may be viewed not as a crisis in the long-term
sense but as a sanity check that prevented what might have turned
out to be a more disastrous speculative bubble from ever devel-
oping. To the extent that this crisis encouraged Asian peoples to
rethink their businesses and their economies in light of the criti-
cism they received from abroad, the crisis may have been helpful
for the countries.
The expansion of markets can, if done correctly, add salience to
information about fundamentals, that is, encourage public attention
to long-run fundamentals and deflect attention away from short-
run speculation. Michael Brennan has proposed that new markets
should be set up for “S&P500 Strips,” that is, a market for the future
annual total dividends of the aggregate S&P500 firms for each year
in the future up to some distant horizon. There would thus be, for
example, in the year 2005 a market for the 2006 aggregate S&Pdiv-
idends, another market for the 2007 aggregate S&Pdividends, yet
another market for the 2008 aggregate S&Pdividends, and in fact
markets for all subsequent aggregate dividends up to the horizon,
say twenty years, and then a market for the terminal index value
(say, in 2025). Brennan argues that such markets would “provide
an incentive for analysts to concentrate on forecasting those fun-
damentals [future dividends] . . . rather than to concentrate on
simply forecasting the level of the market itself. In addition, since
the level of the market index must be consistent with the prices of
the future dividend flows, the relation between these will serve to
reveal the implicit assumptions the market is making in arriving
at its valuation. These assumptions will then be the focus of atten-
tion and debate.”28Note that Brennan’s proposal is fundamentally
different from that of Tobin; Brennan is proposing shifting public
attention to fundamentals rather than to longer-run holdings.
New institutions or markets should also be created that would
make it easier for individuals to get out of their exposure to the stock
market. The institutions we have—such as short sales, stock index
futures, and put options—are not particularly user-friendly, and
most investors do not avail themselves of these. Many investors
today feel themselves locked into their stock holdings because of

the capital-gains-tax consequences of selling and their inability to
find other ways of reducing their exposure.
In my previous book, Macro Markets: Creating Institutions for
Managing Society’s Largest Economic Risks,I have argued that we
should greatly expand the number and variety of markets, to allow
trading of major risks that are untradable today. The proposed
major international markets I call macro markets would include mar-
kets for long-term claims on national incomes for each of the major
countries of the world; markets for long-term claims on the incomes
of specific occupational groups; and markets for currently illiquid
assets, such as single-family homes.29There are a number of ways
to create macro markets, including using perpetual futures or the
macro securities that Allan Weiss and I developed.30If such mar-
kets are created, people can take short positions in them corre-
sponding to their own incomes, to protect themselves against
fluctuations in the value of their own personal sources of income,
and can invest in a truly diversified portfolio around the world. These
markets could indeed be vastly larger than any existing market and
far more numerous in the risks they allow to be offset. Moreover,
retail institutions such as home equity insurance or pension plan
options that correlate negatively with labor income or home values
will help people make use of such risk management tools.31
I believe that creating such new markets may have, besides their
obvious benefits of creating new risk management opportunities,
a salutary effect on speculative excesses by broadening the scope
of market participation. The creation of such markets would help
us discover the prices of many assets that are totally unknown today.
For example, no one today knows what the U.S. economy, the
Japanese economy, or any other economy is worth, nor does any-
one know what a medical career or a law career is worth, since
there are no markets for them. There appear to be unseen spec-
ulative bubbles in the unobserved prices, as people in countries
go through waves of optimism or pessimism for their own
economies, and as people individually make career choices based
on current fashions. These changes encourage excessive invest-
ment of real and human capital in some times and places and in-
adequate investment in others. Creating markets for claims on

income flows will open up the markets to the generally sobering
influence of the rest of the world.
Creating the macro markets would result in a fundamental
shift of attention away from the relatively minor risks to the prof-
its of the public firms that are traded in the stock markets of today
to the risks to our livelihoods. Although one would expect that there
will still be occasional speculative bubbles in the macro markets,
the diversity of investment opportunities and the attention focused
on fundamental risks by these markets around the world ought to
be generally stabilizing to our economies and our lives.
Altering Conventional Wisdom
about Diversification and Hedging
In order to encourage proper risk management, especially once
important new markets are in place, the advice given by public
authorities should stress more genuine diversification. I argued in
this book that people are ultimately highly influenced by the per-
ceived wisdom of experts—the “they say that. . .” authorities—
and they will not carry out investment diversification well unless
experts encourage them to do so.
While financial experts today are typically extolling diversifica-
tion,they do not stress what genuine diversification really means.
Many people still think that they are diversified if they hold stock
in a good number of companies in the U.S. stock market or any U.S.
equity mutual fund. They must invest more broadly than that, and
in fact to achieve true diversification they must also pay attention
to other existing risks.
People have to be encouraged by experts to understand that true
diversification largely means offsetting the risks that they are
already locked into.32This means investing in assets that help insure
their labor incomes, in assets that tend to rise in value when their
labor income declines, or at least that do not tend to move in the
same direction. This objective can be achieved efficiently after
macro markets have been created by taking short positions in claims
on income aggregates, or it can be achieved less effectively today
by taking positions in existing assets that are found to correlate



==================================================

negatively (or at least less positively) with specific labor incomes.33
It also means investing in assets that help insure the equity in their
single-family homes, in assets that tend to rise in value when their
home value declines. This can be achieved most directly by taking
out home equity insurance policies or short positions in a single-
family-home futures market, or it can be achieved less effectively
today by making investments that tend to move opposite to one’s
local city property values.34Since labor income and home equity
account for the great bulk of most people’s wealth, offsetting the
risks to these is the critical function of risk management.
Making such risk-offsetting investments is called hedging, a
time-honored practice in business risk management. But hedging
is foreign to most people’s thinking. Few nonprofessionals could
even define the term today. Discussion of how investment returns
correlate with incomes or with home prices is almost totally absent
from public discourse on investments.
It is difficult to change this mindset, since the public has so much
invested in the conventional wisdom today, and in the notion that
one can amass great wealth through stock market investments. The
personal investment media typically feature the opinions of
celebrity sources who are apparently already rich and who sub-
tly suggest that their advice might make one rich too. It would be
inconsistent with this fantasy to start talking about the mundane
task of defending the value of the assets one already has. Those in
the media and the investment community often do not want to risk
disturbing the get-rich fantasy, which they have learned to exploit
to their own advantage. But attitudes can be changed if public opin-
ion leaders take it upon themselves to stress the changes in think-
ing that must be made. Once it becomes a “they say that...” item,
people will routinely take proper steps to hedge their existing
wealth, much as they routinely buy homeowners insurance today.
Policy toward Speculative Volatility
The problems posed for policy makers by the tendency for spec-
ulative markets to show occasional bubbles are deep ones. They
will have to take full account of our evolving understanding of the

SPECULATIVE VOLATILITY IN A FREE SOCIETY 233
nature of these bubbles when formulating measures to deal with
the problems they cause. Unfortunately, the nature of the bubbles
is sufficiently complex and changing that we can never expect to
document the particular role of any given policy in bringing about
our objective of long-term economic welfare.
Policies that interfere with markets by shutting them down or
limiting them, although under some very specific circumstances
apparently useful, probably should not be high on our list of solu-
tions to the problems caused by speculative bubbles. Speculative
markets perform critical resource-allocation functions (a point I have
taken for granted and have not focused on in this book), and any
interference with markets to tame bubbles interferes with these func-
tions as well.
Ultimately, in a free society, we cannot protect people from all
the consequences of their own errors. We cannot protect people
completely without denying them the possibility of achieving their
own fulfillment. We cannot completely protect society from the ef-
fectsof waves of irrational exuberance or irrational pessimism—
emotional reactions that are themselves part of the human condition.
Policies to deal with speculative volatility are a little like policies
to deal with political instability. We worry that a political party
appealing to baser instincts or rash judgments will gain control.
But we do not deal with this risk by shutting down certain politi-
calparties in times of unrest or by taxing their activities. Instead,
we rely on the complete freedom of all political parties to express
themselves, and we expect that common sense will ultimately pre-
vail among voters. This good outcome is achieved by designing,
and continually improving, rules for campaigns and elections.
By analogy, most of the thrust of our national policies to deal with
speculative bubbles should take the form of facilitating more free
trade, as well as greater opportunities for people to take positions
in more and freer markets. Agood outcome can be achieved by
designing better forms of social insurance and creating better
financial institutions to allow the real risks to be managed more effec-
tively. Themost important thing to keep in mind as we are expe-
riencing a speculative bubble in the stock market today is that we
should not let it distract us from such important tasks.

Notes
Chapter One The Stock Market Level in Historical Perspective
1.Home price data are courtesy Case Shiller Weiss, Inc.
2.The price, dividend, and earnings series are from the same sources as
described in Chapter 26 of my earlier book (Market Volatility[Cambridge, Mass.:
MIT Press, 1989]), although now I use monthly data, rather than annual data.
Monthly dividend and earnings data are computed from the S&Pfour-quarter
totals for the quarter since 1926, with linear interpolation to monthly figures. Div-
idend and earnings data before 1926 are from Cowles and associates (Common
Stock Indexes,2nd ed. [Bloomington, Ind.: Principia Press, 1939]), interpolated from
annual data. Stock price data are monthly averages of daily closing prices
through January 2000, the last month available as this book goes to press. The
CPI-U (Consumer Price Index—All Urban Consumers) published by the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics begins in 1913; for years before 1913 I spliced to the
CPI Warren and Pearson’s price index, by multiplying it by the ratio of the
indexes in January 1913. December 1999 and January 2000 values for the CPI-U
are extrapolated. See George F. Warren and Frank A. Pearson, Gold and Prices(New
York: John Wiley and Sons, 1935). Data are from their Table 1, pp.11–14. For the
plots, I have multiplied the inflation-corrected series by a constant so that their
value in January 2000 equals their nominal value, i.e., so that all prices are effec-
tively in January 2000 dollars.
In my older work on stock prices (much of it done jointly with John Camp-
bell), I had used the Producer Price Index (PPI), All Commodities, rather than the
235

CPI, to deflate. In the past, there was not much difference between the PPI and
the CPI, except for short-run oscillations, but since the mid-1980s the levels of the
series have diverged substantially. Unless otherwise noted, any statistics reported
in this book for the U.S. stock market are from the data set described in this end-
note. The data used here (as well as Chapter 26 fromMarket Volatility) are cur-
rently available on my Web site: http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller.
3.Some have urged that I use a log or ratio scale for the plot, so that the appar-
ent price growth at the end is not “misleading.” I do not believe that plotting lev-
els is in any way misleading. There is no sense of any unusual behavior at the
end of the earnings series that is plotted in the same way.
4.It should be abundantly clear that some smoothing is necessary: consider the
possibility of zero earnings in a given year. Earnings per share adjusted to the S&P
Composite Index have always been strictly greater than zero in every year since
the inception of the index in 1871, but they have come close to zero, and they could
of course pass below zero in the future. Total after-tax corporate profits were actu-
ally negative in the national income accounts for 1931 and 1932. When earnings
are zero, the price-earnings ratio would be infinitein that year, suggesting that there
is no upper bound on the price of the aggregate stock market.
5.Scholars have pointed out that since there was no year zero, each new
century begins on January 1 of a year ending in 1. In 1900, people were more
respectful of such scholarship, and waited a year to celebrate. Acelebration of
the third millennium, in contrast, happened at the start of 2000.
6.There had been a very slow and gradual growth of price relative to earn-
ings for thirty years (real earnings grew at the rate of 2.3% a year from July 1871
to July 1900, while prices grew at a slightly faster rate of 3.4% a year).
7.These are geometric average real returns using the S&PComposite Index
and the Producer Price Index (since the Consumer Price Index begins in 1913)
to convert to real values.

given for similar intervals since 1926 in their book, it must be borne in mind that
theirs are for calendar years only, and therefore do not generally catch the peaks

Chapter Two Precipitating Factors:
The Internet, the Baby Boom, and Other Events
1.Anumber of studies of international data have provided evidence that
countries with more highly developed financial markets show higher economic
growth or allocate resources more efficiently. See Robert G. King and Ross Levine,
“Finance and Growth: Schumpeter May Be Right,” Quarterly Journal of Econom-
ics,108 (1993): 717–37; Rafael LaPorta, Florencio Lopez-de-Silanes, and Andrei
Shleifer, “Corporate Ownership around the World,”Journal of Finance,54 (1999):
471–518; and Jeffrey Wurgler, “Financial Markets and the Allocation of Capital,”
unpublished paper,Yale University, 1999.
2.One study finds that individual investors tend to be less heavily invested
in stocks during business cycle troughs, when expected returns tend to be high,
while institutional investors tend to do the opposite, and hence to work in the
direction of stabilizing the market. See Randolph Cohen, “Asset Allocation Deci-
sions of Individuals and Institutions,” unpublished paper, Harvard Business School,
1999.AMerrill Lynch survey shows that professional fund managers outside the
United States have been generally selling U.S. stocks during bull markets since
1994, but there is no such clear pattern for U.S. fund managers; see Trevor Greetham,
Owain Evans, and Charles I. Clough, Jr., “Fund Manager Survey: November 1999”
(London: Merrill Lynch & Co., Global Securities Research and Economics Group,
1999).
3.Some simple economic growth models suggest that a sudden technologi-
cal advance will have no effect on stock prices; for such models see Robert Barro
and Xavier Sala-i-Martin, Economic Growth (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1995);
Olivier Blanchard and Stanley Fischer,Lectures on Macroeconomics(Cambridge,
Mass.: MIT Press, 1989); or David Romer,Advanced Macroeconomics(NewYork:
McGraw-Hill, 1996). For example, the theoretical effect of a sudden technological
advance might be to spur investment in new capital, which will compete away any
extra profits that the technological advance might generate for existing capital.

executive incentive option plans are adopted; see RichardA. Lambert, W. Lanen,
and D. Larker, “Executive Stock Option Plans and Corporate Dividend Policy,”
Journal of Finance and Quantitative Analysis,24 (1985): 409–25.
9.Share repurchases may also have become more popular in recent years
because firms with higher earnings do not wish to commit themselves to higher
dividends (which investors would then expect to see continued) and because
investors are increasingly aware of the tax advantages of share repurchases over
dividends. Managers also seem to vary their share repurchases from year to year
so as to repurchase when high aggregate stock market returns are coming; there-
fore the high level of repurchases in recent years might conceivably be explained
in terms of managers’ anticipating the bull market. For evidence on share repur-
chases and subsequent returns, see William R. Nelson, “Three Essays on the Abil-
ity of the Change in Shares Outstanding to Predict Stock Returns,” unpublished

real S&PIndex, 1950–92. However, Robin Brooks (“Asset Market and Savings
Effects of Demographic Transitions,” unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, Yale University,
1998) showed that their result was sensitive to the cutoff age (20), and when he

Bakshi and Chen are probably on the right track, but the evidence for a relation
between the Baby Boom and the level of the stock market is weak.

18.See James Grant, “Talking Up the Market,” Financial Times,July 19, 1999,
p.12. Nevertheless, the analysts’ recommendations are still useful if we take account
of this bias. Kent Womack (“Do BrokerageAnalysts’ Recommendations Have
Investment Value?”Journal of Finance,51[1] [1996]: 137–67) shows that when ana-
lysts’ recommendations are switched from hold to buy, the stock does tend to do
well afterward, indicating that analysts do have some ability to predict the
stocks’ returns. When recommendations are switched from hold to sell, the event
is even more accurately predictive (of poorer return). Womack interprets this asym-
metric effect as indicating that because analysts are reluctant to issue sell rec-
ommendations, they do so only when there is a very good reason.

to forecasts of the S&P500. Sharpe’s results do not give any clear evidence that
the bias in earnings forecasts has increased since 1979.

ation of “whisper numbers” on the Internet: earnings forecasts with no attributed

39.Quantitative evidence on gambling behavior is hard to come by for the 1920s.
I counted the number of articles about gambling in the Reader’s Guide to Period-
ical Literatureand reported the percentage of all articles on the subject, as follows
(where I and II denote the first and second halves of the year 1938, respectively):
1919–21 0%
1922–24 0.004%
1925–28 0.021%
1929–32 0.035%
1933–35 0.006%
1936–38-I 0.003%
1938-II–42 0.008%
These numbers do strongly suggest a sudden and temporary surge in pub-
lic interest in gambling between 1925 and 1932, but of course they do not con-
vey anything qualitatively about the nature of changed public attitudes toward
gambling. For a history of gambling and its relation to speculation, see James Grant,
The Trouble with Prosperity: AContrarian Tale of Boom, Bust, and Speculation (New
York: John Wiley and Sons, 1996).
40.The Internet boom, the decline of foreign economic rivals, cultural changes
tending to lionize business success, expanded media reporting of financial news,
analysts’ increasingly optimistic forecasts, the decline of inflation, and the expan-
sion of the volume of stock market trades are all factors in Europe, though often
not as strongly felt as in the United States. Although Europe had less of a

post–World War II Baby Boom than the United States, it did have a pronounced
Baby Bust after the mid-1960s. Europe does not appear to show the same increase
in gambling opportunities evident in the United States. Nevertheless, even though
not all of the precipitating factors are operative in Europe, the strong cultural con-
nections between the United States and Europe, and the effects of U.S. investors’
demand for European stocks, should cause a substantial contagion effect.
Chapter Three Amplification Mechanisms:
Naturally Occurring Ponzi Processes
1.I have been conducting various surveys of investors since the mid-1980s,
most notably regular surveys starting in 1989 of institutional investors in both
the United States and (with the collaboration of Fumiko Kon-Ya and Yoshiro Tsut-
sui) Japan. I have surveyed individual investors only intermittently, and I had
not thought to ask these questions until 1996. See Robert J. Shiller, “Measuring
Bubble Expectations and Investor Confidence,”Journal of Psychology and Markets,
1(1) (2000): 49–60. Wealthy individuals were surveyed, rather than a random sample
of the entire population, because wealthy people have more investments and are
more influential in the markets.
2.The sample size is large enough that the standard error on the 96% is only
±2%; standard errors of percentages reported in this section are all less than ±5%.
Of course, it is conceivable that the results are unreliable for reasons other than
sample size; for example, those who chose to answer the questionnaire might be
more likely than others to feel confident about the stock market. On the other hand,
those who answer the questionnaire are more likely to be the kind of active
investors who influence markets, and so the respondents may be more repre-
sentative of the investors who are behind the stock market boom than would be
a truly random group of wealthy respondents.
3.I have seen evidence of investor overconfidence in real estate markets as well.
In a 1988 questionnaire survey of new home buyers in California that I under-
took with Karl Case during a housing price boom there, we asked home buyers
inAnaheim (a city near Los Angeles) whether they thought that the housing prices
in their city would go up or down in the next several years; 98% thought that prices
would go up. When asked whether buying a house today entails risk, 63%
answeredthat there was “little or no risk.” See Karl E. Case, Jr., and Robert J. Shiller,
“The Behavior of Home Buyers in Boom and Post-Boom Markets,” New England
Economic Review,November-December 1988, pp. 29–46. As a matter of fact, hous-
ingprices in the Los Angeles area experienced a major bust starting two years
after the survey, and now, even after some recovery, prices are still 20% lower in
real (inflation-corrected) terms than they were at the time of the survey in 1988
(data from Case Shiller Weiss, Inc.). A20% decline in real value is approximately

equal to the entire down payment of a typical home buyer. Buying a house then
was hardly the riskless investment that most interviewees thought it was.
4.I did not ask on the questionnaire whether they thought the market would
surely go down, but available data on expectations show that most do not think
so today.
5.I have asked the same question of institutional investors every six months
since 1989. There is an upward trend in the percentage of those who predict an
increase, but the uptrend has been less dramatic than for individual investors.
See Shiller, “Measuring Bubble Expectations and Investor Confidence.” In that
paper I also discuss other measures of investor confidence and construct an
index of investor confidence. The index shows no clear trend among institutional
investors since 1989.

21.Some economic theorists claim that negative bubbles cannot occur, since prices
have a floor at zero; therefore investors know that price cannot fall forever, and they
should figure out that a negative bubble cannot even get started. But what they mean
to say is that bubbles cannot occur when everyone is rational and calculating—and
when everyone assumes that everyone else is rational and calculating.
22.The literature on applications of chaos theory to economics usually does
not stress the kind of price feedback model discussed here, but it may nonethe-
less offer some insights into the sources of complexity in financial markets. See
Michael Boldrin and Michael Woodford, “Equilibrium Models Displaying Endoge-
nous Fluctuations and Chaos: ASurvey,”Journal of Monetary Economics,25(2) (1990):
189–222, for a survey of this literature. See also Benoit Mandelbrot,Fractals and

Market,” in W. B. Arthur, S. Durlauf, and D. Lane (eds.), The Economy as an Evolv-
ing Complex System II(Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1997). Another related
literature sets up experimental markets in which people trade in an environment
that is designed so that there is no news or other confounding factors. In these
controlled circumstances there tend to be extraneous “bubble” price movements;

finance; however, it refers not to feedback loops but instead to an assumption in
their models that investors cannot go deeper and deeper into debt forever.
Chapter Four The News Media
1.No doubt there were speculative price movements before there were news-
papers, but I have found no pre-newspaper accounts of widespread public
attention to speculative price movements that are described by contemporaries
as wild and inexplicable or as due solely to investors’ exuberance.
The first regularly published newspapers appeared in the early 1600s. Once
publishers discovered how to generate public interest, increase circulation, and
make a profit, papers sprung up rapidly in many European cities.
We might date the beginning of the mass media somewhat earlier, to the inven-
tion of printing itself, when publication became no longer dependent on patrons.
Innumerable pamphlets, broadsides, and religious and political tracts were
printed during the 1500s. Historian of printing David Zaret (Origins of Democratic
Culture: Printing, Petitions, and the Public Sphere in Early-Modern England[Prince-
ton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1999], p. 136) notes that “printing put
commerce squarely at the center of textual production. Unlike that of scribal pro-
duction, the economics of text production increasingly involved calculation,
risk taking, and other market behaviors in which printers oriented production
to vague estimations of popular demand for printed texts.” The advent of print-
ing brought with it an increased incentive for literacy; by the 1600s many if not
most urban people in Europe could read.
Histories of speculative manias, such as Charles P. Kindlberger, Manias,
Panics and Crashes: AHistory of Financial Crises,2nd ed. (London: Macmillan, 1989)
give no examples of speculative bubbles before the 1600s, and my polling of local
historians provided none either. However, I cannot claim to have researched their
history exhaustively.
Indeed there are probably some stories that couldbe regarded as an exception
to my generalization about the coincidence of the first manias and the first

newspapers, although other interpretations are also possible. Yale historian Paul
Freedman offered me the example of pepper as a possible exception: its price in
the spice trade seems at times to have been surprisingly high, and in the 1500s
it was very volatile. There are ancient and medieval examples of grain prices soar-
ing at times of famine. Land price movements were also remarked in history. For
example, in a letter to Nepos aroundA.D. 95, Pliny the Younger writes, “Have you
heard that the price of land has gone up, particularly in the neighborhood of Rome?
The reason for the sudden increase in price has given rise to a good deal of dis-
cussion.” (Pliny the Younger,Letters and Panegyrics,trans. Betty Radice [Cambridge,
Mass.:Harvard University Press, 1969], Book 6, No. 19, pp. 437–38.) By saying
that there was much discussion, he is suggesting word-of-mouth effects, but he
really does not tell a mania story.
2.The tulip mania, a speculative bubble in the price of tulips in Holland in
the 1630s, will be discussed in Chapter 9.
There were Dutch newspapers by 1618, and Holland, in contrast to other
countries at the time, allowed the printing of domestic news, not just foreign news.
On these pioneering Dutch newspapers, see Robert W. Desmond, The Informa-
tion Process: World News Reporting to the Twentieth Century(Iowa City: University
of Iowa Press, 1978).
The primary surviving source of information about the tulip mania is a pam-
phlet published in Holland during its peak. The anonymous 1637 document, in
the form of a dialogue between two men, gives detailed news of the speculation
as it was then unfolding. Numerous other pamphlets about the mania, published
just after its end, also survive; see Peter Garber,Famous First Bubbles: The Fun-
damentals of Early Manias(Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 2000). These surviving
pamphlets confirm the existence of well-developed print media capable of dis-
seminating information about the tulip mania as it happened.

10.Professors Gur Huberman and Tomer Regev of Columbia University
wrote a case study of the soaring price of an individual company’s stock in
response to a newspaper story that, while compellingly written, actually revealed
no news. The share price of EntreMed rose from 12 to 85 from the close of the
market the day before to its opening on the day of a front-pageNew York Times
story that described the potential of the company’s drugs to cure cancer. They
document that every fact in the story had already been published five months
earlier. (See Gur Huberman and Tomer Regev, “Speculating on a Cure for
Cancer:ANon-Event that Made Stock Prices Soar,” unpublished manuscript,
Columbia University Graduate School of Business, 1999.) It is plausible—
although the authors do not document this—that many of the buyers of EntreMed
shares on that day knew there was no news in the story, but merely bought think-
ing that a story that was so well written and featured so prominently would boost
the share price.

19.Of course, since the questionnaire was filled out afterthe crash, part of this
reported concern with overpricing may have been due to hindsight bias. Indeed
we cannot completely trust even the self-categorization, into buyers versus
sellers on October 19, that respondents made on the questionnaire. The anonymity
of the questionnaires, the plea for truthfulness, and the stated purpose of the ques-
tionnaire as a tool for scientific research on the crash should all have helped to
provide us with more nearly objective answers, but of course no survey results
can be trusted completely.

immediate impact on some stocks. It is possible that this news served as a trigger
for the crash, as the Brady Commission concludes, by generating initial price
decreases, even if the news had been largely forgotten by the day of the crash.

gradually as consumer prices increase. Careful thought about such timing issues
is too technical for most public discourse, and therefore the issue will most
likely never be resolved in the popular mind (or, for that matter, definitively by
economists).

the Netherlands, Norway, the Philippines, South Africa, the United States,
andVenezuela. The remaining countries from this data source and their starting
dates are as follows: Brazil, August 1991; Chile, November 1978; Colombia,
October 1963; Denmark, February 1969; Israel, November 1982; Jamaica, July 1969;

den, January 1976; and the United Kingdom, December 1957. The data for the

other six countries are taken from Datastream, and their starting dates are as fol-
lows:Australia, March 1973; Hong Kong, July 1974; Indonesia, January 1996;
Singapore, February 1986; Taiwan, January 1986; and Thailand, January 1984.
For each country, the monthly stock price index was divided by the consumer
price index for the same month to produce a real stock price index. Changes in the
real stock price index reported are largest month-to-month changes in the real indexes
over the intervals shown, excluding intervals that occurred within three years of
each other. Periods of consumer price index inflation greater than 4% a month were
excluded, since in times of high inflation inaccuracies of timing or calculation of
the consumer price index could cause spurious jumps in stock price indexes.
The tables also show, at the far right, the percentage change in the real stock
price index for the period of the same length (twelve months or five years) start-
ing in the month at which the period shown in the table ends. Thus, for example,
reading from Table 6.1, we see that the Philippine stock market rose 683.4% in
real, inflation-corrected terms from December 1985 to December 1986, and rose
another 28.4% from December 1986 to December 1987. For another example, read-
ing from Table 6.4, we see that the Spanish stock market fell 86.6% in real, inflation-
corrected terms from December 1974 to December 1979 and then rose 0.1% from
December 1979 to December 1984.

correlation of returns.
13.To judge whether a large price increase (or decrease) portends future
increases or decreases, it is tempting to try to use the results shown in the tables
alone. One notes, for example, from Table 6.3 that of the twenty episodes whose
large price increases occurred long enough ago that we can observe the subse-
quent five-year price change, thirteen (65%) of the subsequent price changes were
down, and the average real price change, averaging over all episodes shown in
Table 6.3, was –10%. One notes, too, from Table 6.4, that of the twenty-one
episodes whose large price decreases occurred long enough ago that we can
observe the subsequent five-year real price change, sixteen (76%) were positive,
and the average price increase, averaging over all the episodes shown in Table 6.4,
was 130%.
However, there is a problem in interpreting these results as evidence that the
markets can be predicted, since we used data subsequent to the five-year inter-
vals shown in the tables to identify the five-year intervals as the largest. To find
evidence that markets can be predicted, we must use some method of identify-
ing periods of large price increase that allows these periods to be identified just
as they happen. The results shown in the text here use the data that underlie the
tables but instead are based on identifying all intervals of the length shown that
would make the table. (Let us refer to all such real price changes as largechanges.)
Then, for each large-change interval, we identify a subsequent interval of the same
length, which starts in the month that the large-change interval ended. For each
country, we computed the average subsequent real price change by averaging over
the subsequent price intervals for the country—either intervals subsequent to large-
price-increase intervals or intervals subsequent to large-price-decrease intervals.
We then report (separately for intervals subsequent to increases and subsequent
to decreases) the fraction of countries for which this average is positive, and we
report the average over the countries of the country-average real price change.
For example, in Table 6.3, the smallest five-year price increase that makes the
table is 230.9% (for Hong Kong, row 25 of the table). For each country for which
data made it possible to do so, we identified all sixty-month large-price-increase
intervals (sixty-month intervals whose real price increase was 230.9% or more,
many of these intervals overlapping with each other), and for each of these inter-
vals we computed the percentage real price change for the subsequent sixty-
month interval. We then averaged these percentage real price changes for all of
the subsequent intervals for the country, to produce for that country the average
subsequent real price change.

The average value reported in the text, the average of these averages over all
countries, is the average return one would have received if one had invested equal
amounts in all countries after the periods of price change. It should be noted that
the differences observed in these averages between intervals subsequent to large
price increases and intervals subsequent to large price decreases still do not by
themselves positively prove that there is a profit opportunity in investing in
countries whose market prices have gone down or in shorting stocks in countries
whose market prices have gone up. There are still other issues, concerning pos-
sible differences across countries and over time in riskiness, in market returns,
or in dividend yields. Furthermore, even though the difference between the
five-year subsequent real price changes is highly statistically significant, there is
also the issue of a possible bias in my decision to select five-year price intervals
to study. These issues are not addressed by the analysis here, and most could not
be completely settled with any degree of further analysis of such data. Rigorous
and incontrovertible proof that profit opportunities exist has always been elu-
sive in financial research, and it is not so much any one study, but rather the weight
of the evidence from years of careful research on market inefficiencies within the
finance profession, that inspires confidence that markets are not fully efficient.
See Chapter 9 for a further discussion of these issues.

years. He shows that it is extremely rare for companies to offer discount incen-
tives for employees to buy company stocks, that employees freely make choices
to invest in company stock, and that employee decisions to invest in company
stock do not reflect superior employee information about the company, since the
level of purchases does not predict returns on the stock in the future.

4.Milgram noted that subjects believed that the experimenter was an expert
who knew more than they did. When he tried a variation of the experiment in
which the experimenter was clearly not an expert, he found a much-diminished
tendency for subjects to administer the shocks (ibid., pp. 89–112). Nevertheless
Milgram, like Asch, did not seem to be aware of an information-based interpre-
tation for his results. He thought that they revealed an “instinct for obedience”
that had developed from a general evolutionary principle of the “survival of value
hierarchy” (ibid., pp.123–25).

17.The advertisement quoting Lynch appeared in numerous places, for example
inMutual Funds,September 1999, p.37. The ad says that the data are for the S&P
500 Index, but it does not give the sample period. By searching for the interval
of greatest earnings growth, and making no correction for inflation, I can roughly
replicate the quoted results. To maximize earnings growth, one chooses a start
date right after World War II, when earnings were still depressed by the war, and
also at the bottom of the recession in October 1945. Lagging four-quarter-total
S&Pearnings went up 48-fold from the second quarter of 1946 to the third quar-
ter of 1997. Between June 1946 and April 1998, the S&P500 went up 60-fold. Lynch’s
basic result is therefore more or less confirmed for these intervals. But if one chooses
other intervals the results look very different. Between the fourth quarter of 1947
and the fourth quarter of 1998, earnings went up only 23-fold, while between
December 1947 and April 1999 the S&P500 went up 83-fold. These slightly dif-
ferent sample periods give a very different impression than that created by the
ad: these results show price growing far more than earnings.
Over the period from 1946 to 1997, the producer-price index went up seven-
fold, and so in fact real earnings increased only sevenfold in this period. Aseven-
fold earnings increase is a growth rate of real earnings of about 4% a year.
Between the fourth quarter of 1947 and the fourth quarter of 1998, the growth
rate of real earnings was only 3% per year. The growth of inflation-corrected earn-
ings over this entire interval has not been impressive: no more than the current
rate of interest on inflation-indexed government bonds. But the ad—by choos-
ing sample creatively, by reporting changes over very long time intervals, and
by not making an inflation correction—fosters the false impression that enormous
price increases are warranted by enormous earnings increases.

toactual price, except that their model, by making stock prices more responsive
to dividends when dividends are higher, makes warranted price correspond more
closely to actual price after 1950.

24.To compute the dividend present value for any given month, one sums over
each subsequent month the present discounted value for the given month of the
real dividends paid in that subsequent month. The present discounted value in
the given month of a real dividend paid in a subsequent month is the real divi-
dend divided by (1+ r)t,whereris the monthly real discount rate and tis the num-
ber of months between the given month and the subsequent month. The dividend
present value in Figure 9.1 was drawn with a constant discount rate requal to
the historical geometric average real monthly return on the market from January
1871 to June 1999, or 0.6% a month. The assumption that ris constant through
time corresponds to an efficient markets assumption that expected returns on the
market are constant through time, that there are no good or bad times to enter
the stock market in terms of predictable returns. Some more sophisticated versions
of the efficient markets hypothesis allow rto vary over time, but these versions
imply that the returns on the stock market are forecastable. The simple present
value computed here is relevant to the most popular, and most important, ver-
sion of the efficient markets model.
Of course, we do not know now what dividends will be after the latest year
for which data are available. To compute the dividend present value, I assumed
that real dividends will grow from 1.25 times their December 1999 value at their
historical average growth rate from January 1871 to December 1999, which is
0.1% per month. The 1.25 factor makes a rough correction for the fact that divi-
dend payout rates have, in recent years, been about 80% of their historical
average payout rate (dividends as a fraction of ten-year moving average earn-
ings). The need to make an assumption about real dividend growth after Decem-
ber 1999 means that the more recent values of the dividend present value shown
in the figure are unreliable as indicators of actual dividend present value. How-
ever, the numbers given for the dividend present value a couple of decades or
more before 2000 are most likely fairly accurate, since for these years the subsequent

years after 2000 are heavily discounted in the present value calculations. Even
the dividend present value shown in the Figure 9.1 for 2000 is quite possibly fairly
accurate, if one accepts that growth possibilities for future dividends are differ-
ent from those of the past only to the extent that dividend payout is lower.
The series shown in my 1981 article were detrended.
25.It must be stressed that efficient markets theory does not mean that the stock
price curve must be more smooth than the dividend present value curve, only
that it must be—in a sense that must be carefully defined—less volatileoverall. I
took great pains to explain this point in my first article on excess volatility; see Robert
J. Shiller, “The Volatility of Long-Term Interest Rates and Expectations Models
of the Term Structure,”Journal of Political Economy,87 (1979): 1062–88. But some
critics, overlooking this explanation, thought they were raising a fresh and orig-
inal idea when they later pointed it out again; see, notably,Allan Kleidon, “Vari-
ance Bounds Tests and Stock Price Valuation Models,” Journal of Political Economy,
94 (1986): 953–1001. No definitive conclusions can be drawn about efficient
markets just by looking at this figure. Nonetheless the figure is, I believe, quite
informative about the lack of big-picture evidence for efficient markets in aggre-
gate U.S. stock market data. Looking at this figure can help disabuse us of some
possibly erroneous notions about the nature of the evidence for market efficiency.
26.Their argument had to do with firms’ setting dividends in response to price,
and thereby achieving a certain sort of nonstationarity in dividends; see TerryA.
Marsh and Robert C. Merton, “Dividend Variability and Variance Bounds Tests
for the Rationality of Stock Market Prices,” American Economic Review, 76(3)
(1986): 483–98. In my reply, I argued that although their model was technically
correct, it was hardly relevant to actual U.S. experience over the last century; see
Robert J. Shiller, “The Marsh-Merton Model of Managers’ Smoothing of Divi-
dends,”American Economic Review,76(3) (1986): 499–503. The entire debate is now
moot, since econometric work testing for excess volatility no longer relies on
assumed stationarity for dividends; see, for example, John Y. Campbell and John
Ammer, “What Moves Stock and Bond Markets? AVariance Decomposition for
Long-TermAsset Returns,” Journal of Finance,48(1) (1993): 3–38.
27.Campbell and I developed a co-integrated log-linear vector-autoregressive
model that was capable of representing various forms of the efficient markets model.

Helwege, and David Laster (“Stock Market Valuation Indicators: Is This Time Dif-
ferent?”Financial Analysts Journal,52 [1996]: 56–64) estimate that considering share
repurchase as a form of dividend would raise dividend-price ratios in the mid-
1990s by about 80 basis points. This adjustment would still leave dividend-price
ratios on the S&P Composite far below their record historic lows until now.
Liang and Sharpe, “Share Repurchases and Employee Stock Options,” point
out that the Cole et al. assumption that share issues occur at market prices is inac-
curate because many issues come about in response to the exercise of employee
stock options. Consideration of the fact that issues are made below market price
might be interpreted as suggesting lowering the terminal value for the dividend
present value below the amount shown in Figure 9.1.
Chapter Ten Investor Learning—And Unlearning
1.Economists have long puzzled over why the equity premium has been so
high historically. How, they wonder, can it be that over the years people haven’t
invested more in stocks, given that stocks so outperform other investments? See
Raj Mehra and Edward C. Prescott, “The Equity Premium Puzzle,” Journal of Mon-
etary Economics,15 (1988): 145–61.According to the learning theory discussed
in this chapter, the equity premium puzzle is supposed to be a thing of the past—
people have finally wised up.

4.Fisher,Stock Market Crash,pp.202, 99. It is puzzling that he includes the phrase
“during a period of dollar depreciation,” since he emphasizes elsewhere in the book
that the 1920s were a period of exceptionally stable prices. Perhaps he meant to say
“even during a period of dollar depreciation” and may have been referring to one
of the periods in the 1920s when there was slight inflation. He cannot be referring
to the exchange rate of the dollar, since we were then on the gold standard.

tion,Table 2-11, p.50, there has been no twenty-year period since 1926 when stocks
underperformed short-term interest rates. They do not show data on the 1901–21

time period. My data, from my book Market Volatility(updated by using the
Consumer Price Index to measure inflation after 1913), actually show a slight under-
performance of stocks versus short-term interest rates for 1966–86 as well as
1901–21, and the difference in results between my data and Ibbotson’s for
1966–86 can be attributed to a difference in the short-term interest rate (commercial
paper versus Treasury bills) and slight differences in timing.

mance,”Journal of Business,69 (1996): 133–37.
14.To the extent that mutual funds make better diversification possible for indi-
vidual investors, they lower the riskiness of stocks, and therefore the prolifera-
tion of mutual funds may lower the risk premium that investors require. John
Heaton and Deborah Lucas conclude that increased diversification “goes at
least half way towards justifying the current high price dividend ratio in the United
States.” Heaton and Lucas raise a valid and potentially significant issue; never-
theless their theory is a little unsatisfying, as it depicts individuals as completely
rational at all times but does not explain why people did not invest that much in
mutual funds until recently. See John Heaton and Deborah Lucas, “Stock Prices
and Fundamentals,” unpublished paper, Northwestern University, 1999.
Chapter Eleven Speculative Volatility in a Free Society
1.One might expect to see some offset of the low dividend yield to the extent
that share repurchases are substituting for dividends (recall the discussion in Chap-
ter 2). But with annual net share repurchases on the order of 1% of shares,
dividend yields are still very low even after accounting for repurchases.

the endowments of Harvard, Rochester, and Yale is discussed in Andrew Tobias,
“The Billion-Dollar Harvard-Yale Game,” Esquire,December 19, 1978, pp.77–85.
This article appears to be the source of the oft-repeated story that Yale responded
to the 1969 Ford Foundation report by investing its endowment heavily in the
stock market just before the 1973–74 crash and then suffered greatly. But if one
reads the Tobias story carefully one sees that his own data do not support such
a conclusion. In fact, although it suffered in the 1973–74 crash, Yale did not increase
its level of investment in the stock market after the Ford Foundation report, and
the exposure of the Yale endowment to stock market risk was actually reduced
just before the 1973–74 crash.

9.I have tried to understand the failure of the public to be very interested in index-
ing their contracts. The reason appears to be tied up with money illusion, a ten-
dency to see the currency as the ultimate indicator of value (see Chapter2), and
with a failure to appreciate the risks of price level change, along with a mistrust
of formulas and price indexes; see Robert J. Shiller, “Public Resistance to Indexa-
tion:APuzzle,”Brookings Papers on Economic Activity,1 (1997): 159–211.

Company Institute, Washington, D.C.), 5(1) (1999): 2. Results are based on a
sample that covers 6.6 million active participants.
11.According to the ICI/EBRI study (VanDerhei et al., “401(k) Plan AssetAllo-
cation”), 24.5% of the participants in the 1996 sample had 80% or more of their
plan balances invested in equity funds. This figure underestimates their expo-
sure to the stock market, since the category of equity funds excludes investments
in their own company’s stock and exposure to the stock market from balanced
funds.According to a TIAA-CREF study of its own participants’ premium allo-
cations, the percentage of participants who allocate 100% to equities has risen
almost monotonically from 1986 to 1996, from 3.3% of participants in 1986 to 22.2%
in 1996. More recently, according to data provided to me by John Ameriks, the
percent allocating 100% to equities has risen to 28.8% as of June 1999. See John
Ameriks, Francis P. King, and Mark Warshawsky, “PremiumAllocations and Accu-

origins of the Japanese stock market decline; see Robert J. Shiller, Fumiko Kon-

at the outbreak of World War I and panic selling by Europeans on the exchange.
The New York Stock Exchange was the only major stock market still open at the
end of July 1914, the only place where stocks could still be converted into cash,
and that was thought to be an untenable situation. There might well have been
a world stock market crash of record proportions at that time, but we will never
know, since it was forestalled by the market closings.

called true “market portfolio” that finance theorists only dream about. Younger
working people and people who are less risk averse may short this market, and
elderly people who are no longer working can take long positions, thereby liv-
ing off a completely diversified portfolio in their retirement.

large effects on economic welfare. See Stefano Athanasoulis and Robert J. Shiller,

Opportunities,” unpublished paper,Yale University, 1999.
