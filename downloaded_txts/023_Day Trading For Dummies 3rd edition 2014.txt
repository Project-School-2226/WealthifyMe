Introduction
A
lot has happened since the first version of Day Trading For Dummies
came out. We’ve had a global financial crisis. Brokerage firms have
introduced smartphone apps for trading. NASDAQ shut down for three hours
due to a systems failure. A new currency, the bitcoin, was invented. The rules
of trading have changed along with all the financial and economic upheaval,
and savvy people looking for success in day trading need an up-to-the-minute
reference like this new edition to steer them straight.
Day trading is a business in which you use real money to take on the markets.
If you love the thrill of the markets and have the patience to sit and stare at a
screen for hours, waiting for the right moment to get in and get out of securi-
ties, then day trading may be a great career option. But it has risks, too. Any
day can be your best day, but it can also put you out of business forever.
For that reason, day trading requires the right psychological makeup. Good
day traders are patient and decisive, confident but not arrogant. They most
certainly are not gamblers, although day trading attracts gamblers who dis-
cover it’s a great way to lose money from home.
Day Trading For Dummies, 3rd Edition, is for people who are looking for a
new business or who simply want to supplement their investment returns
with new techniques. In this book you can find all the information you need
to determine whether you’re cut out for day trading, to lay out your home
office, to research and plan trades, and more. (And even if you decide day
trading isn’t for you, you can still find lots of sound general advice about
markets, trading, and investing strategies that you can benefit from. Plus
you’ll have saved all the money you would have otherwise invested on
research and training, not to mention the trading losses!)
A lot of people make a lot of money selling services to neophyte day trad-
ers, claiming to be the best thing going. And maybe so — for some people.
In this book, I give a wider perspective. Instead of telling you to use a par-
ticular trading strategy, for example, I help you research and evaluate the
different day-trading methods available so that you can find one that works
for you. And I also tell you up front that if you decide to day trade, this book
shouldn’t be your only guide.

Day Trading For Dummies, 3rd Edition
About This Book
First, let me tell you what this book is not: It’s not a textbook, and it’s not
a handbook for professional investors. Several of those are on the market
already, and they’re fabulous, but they’re often dry and assume you already
have a lot of knowledge about day trading.
This book doesn’t make those assumptions. It contains straightforward
explanations of how day trading works, how to get started, what the pitfalls
are, and what some of the alternatives are for your portfolio and for your
career. It’s designed for you to be able to skip around and read the chapters
or sections that interest you, without having to read every word that comes
before them. This book has more than enough content to get you started —
or to guide you to something that’s a better fit for your sensibilities. If you
really want to read some textbooks, I list a few in the appendix.
Oh, and I like to think this book isn’t dry, either.
As for conventions, here are the basics: I put important words that I define in
italics. I often bold the key words of lists to bring the important ideas to your
attention. And I place all web addresses in monofont to set them apart.
During printing of this book, some of the web addresses may have broken
across two lines of text. If you come across such an address, rest assured
that I haven’t put in any extra characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the
break. When using a broken web address, type in exactly what you see on the
page, pretending that the line break doesn’t exist.
I also include sidebars in the book that you don’t really need to read in order
to follow the chapter text. With that stated, though, I do encourage you to go
back and read through this extra material when you have the time. Many of
the sidebars contain practice examples that help you get an even better idea
of how some of the investment concepts work. Some of the information is
pretty fun, too.
Foolish Assumptions
In writing this book, I made some assumptions about you, the reader.
✓ You’re someone who needs to know a lot about day trading in a short
period of time.
✓ You may be considering a career change, looking for a productive part-
time retirement activity, or bored and looking for a challenge. Maybe
you just want to know if day trading is a good way to supplement your

current investment program. Whatever your reason for considering day
trading, you want to know how to decide whether it’s the right option
for you.
✓ If you already know that day trading is right for you, you want to
know how to get started, from opening an account to setting up your
computer monitors. (And yep, that’s plural.)
✓ You have extra money to trade (whether it’s yours or not) and you want
to try day trading techniques to goose up your portfolio returns.
✓ You have some understanding of the basics of investing — that you
know what mutual funds and brokerage accounts are, for example. If you
don’t feel comfortable with that much, you may want to read the latest
editions of Investing For Dummies (by Eric Tyson, published by Wiley) or
Mutual Funds For Dummies (also by Tyson; Wiley) and then come back
here. I can wait.
Icons Used in This Book
As you read this book, you’ll see icons scattered around the margins of the
text. Each icon points out a certain type of information, most of which you
should know or may find interesting about day trading. They go as follows:
This icon notes something you should keep in mind about day trading. It may
refer to something I covered earlier in the book, or it may highlight something
you need to remember for future investing decisions.
Tip information tells you how to invest a little better, a little smarter, and a
little more efficiently. The information can help you make better day trades or
ask better questions of people who want to supply you with research, training,
and trading systems.
I’ve included nothing in this book that can cause death or bodily harm, as far
as I can figure out, but plenty of things in the world of day trading can cause
you to lose big money or, worse, your sanity. These points help you avoid big
problems.
I put the nonessential (but often helpful) academic stuff here. By reading
material marked by this icon, you get the detailed information behind the
investment theories or, sometimes, some interesting trivia or background
information.

Beyond the Book
In addition to the book content, you can find a free online Cheat Sheet that
includes information on accounts, definitions, indicators, and performance
calculation. Go to www.dummies.com/cheatsheet/daytrading to access
this handy reference material, and then print it out and keep it by your side
as you get started.
You can also access additional free articles that cover information I simply
couldn’t fit into the book. You’ll find information on a day in the life of a
trade. I also offer advice about chat rooms and Internet forums and a list of
ten alternatives to day trading. You can find them at www.dummies.com/
extras/daytrading.
Where to Go from Here
Well, open up the book and get going! If you have a particular area of interest,
use the index and table of contents to go to the topic you want. If you’re not
sure, you can either turn the page and start at the beginning or flip through
and see whether a topic catches your eye.
Need more guidance than that? Then allow me to give you some ideas. You
may want to start with Chapter 1 if you know nothing about day trading. If
you need to get set up to start trading, look at Chapters 11 and 12. If you
want to know about some of the potential problems in day trading, turn to
Chapters 4, 14, 15, and 16. If you are thinking about day trading as a career,
Chapter 2 describes what day traders do all day. For ideas about developing
strategies, whether you’re going to hold for a few minutes or several years,
go to Part II.
Bottom line: Anywhere you go, you’ll find interesting and useful information.

ake money from the comfort of your home! Be your own boss! Beat
the market with your own smarts! Build real wealth! Tempting, isn’t
it? Day trading can be a great way to make money all on your own. It’s also a
great way to lose a ton of money all on your own. Do you have the fortitude
to face the market every morning?
Day trading is a crazy business. Traders work in front of their computer
screens, reacting to blips, each of which represents real dollars. They make
quick decisions because their ability to make money depends on successfully
executing a large number of trades that generate small profits. They close out
their positions in the stocks, options, and futures contracts they own at the
end of the day, which limits some of the risks — nothing can happen overnight
to disturb an existing profit position — but those limits on risk can limit profits.
After all, a lot can happen in a year, increasing the likelihood that your trade
idea will work out, but in a day? You have to be patient and work fast. Some
days offer nothing good to buy. Other days, every trade seems to lose money.
The individual human-being day trader is up against a tough opponent: high-
frequency algorithms programmed and operated by brokerage firms and
hedge funds that have no emotion and can make trades in less time than it
takes to blink your eye. If you’re not prepared for that competition, you will
be crushed.

disadvantages of day trading, list the personality traits of successful day

traders, and give you information on your likelihood of success. You may find
that day trading is a great career option that takes advantage of your street
smarts and clear thinking — or that the risk outweighs the potential benefits.
Either is okay: The more you know before you make the decision to trade, the
greater your chance of being successful. If you decide that day trading isn’t
right for you, you can apply strategies and techniques that day traders use to
improve the performance of your investment portfolio.
It’s All in a Day’s Work: Defining
Day Trading
The definition of day trading is that day traders hold their securities for only
one day. They close out their positions at the end of every day and then start
all over again the next day. By contrast, swing traders hold securities for days
and sometimes even months; investors sometimes hold for years. The short-
term nature of day trading reduces some risks, because nothing can happen
overnight to cause big losses. Meanwhile, many other types of investors go to
bed thinking their position is in great shape only to wake up the next morning
to find that the company has announced terrible earnings or that its CEO is
being indicted on fraud charges.
But there’s a flip side (there’s always a flip side, isn’t there?): The day trader’s
choice of securities and positions has to work out in a day, or it’s gone.
Tomorrow doesn’t exist for any specific position. Meanwhile, the swing
trader or the investor has the luxury of time, because it sometimes takes a
while for a position to work out the way your research shows it should. In
the long run, markets are efficient, and prices reflect all information about a
security. Unfortunately, a few days of short runs may need to occur for this
efficiency to kick in.
Day traders are speculators working in zero-sum markets one day at a time.
That makes the dynamics different from other types of financial activities you
may have been involved in. When you take up day trading, the rules that may
have helped you pick good stocks or find great mutual funds over the years no
longer apply. Day trading is a different game with different rules.
Speculating, not hedging
Professional traders fall into two categories: speculators and hedgers.
Speculators look to make a profit from price changes. Hedgers look to protect
against a price change. They make their buy and sell choices as insurance,

==================================================

Chapter 1: So You Want to Be a Day Trader
not as a way to make a profit, so they choose positions that offset their
exposure in another market.
As examples of hedging, consider a food-processing company and the farmer
who raises or grows the ingredients the company needs. The company may
look to hedge against the risks of price increases of key ingredients — like
corn, cooking oil, or meat — by buying futures contracts on those ingredi-
ents. That way, if prices do go up, the company’s profits on the contracts
help fund the higher prices it has to pay for those ingredients. If the prices
stay the same or go down, the company loses only the price of the contract,
which may be a fair tradeoff to the company. The farmer raising corn, soy-
beans, or cattle, on the other hand, benefits if prices go up and suffers if they
go down. To protect against a price decline, the farmer would sell futures on
those commodities. His futures position would make money if the price went
down, offsetting the decline on his products. And if the prices went up, he’d
lose money on the contracts, but that loss would be offset by his gain on his
harvest.
The commodity markets were intended to help agricultural producers manage
risk and find buyers for their products. The stock and bond markets were
intended to create an incentive for investors to finance companies. Speculation
emerged in all of these markets almost immediately, but it was not their
primary purpose.
Day traders are all speculators. They look to make money from the market as
they see it now. They manage their risks by carefully allocating their money,
using stop and limit orders (which close out positions as soon as predeter-
mined price levels are reached), and closing out at the end of the night. Day
traders don’t manage risk with offsetting positions the way a hedger does.
They use other techniques to limit losses, like careful money management
and stop and limit orders (which you can read about in Chapter 2).
Markets have both hedgers and speculators in them. Knowing that different
participants have different profit and loss expectations can help you navigate
the turmoil of each day’s trading. And that’s important, because to make
money in a zero-sum market, you only make money if someone else loses.
Understanding zero-sum markets
A zero-sum game has exactly as many winners as losers. And options and
futures markets, which are popular with day traders, are zero-sum markets.
If the person who holds an option makes a profit, then the person who wrote
(which is option-speak for sold) that option loses the same amount. There’s
no net gain or net loss in the market as a whole.

==================================================

10
Part I: Getting Started with Day Trading
Now some of those people buying and selling in zero-sum markets are
hedgers who are content to take small losses in order to prevent big ones.
Speculators may have the profit advantage in certain market conditions,
but they can’t count on having that advantage all the time.
So who wins and who loses in a zero-sum market? Some days, whether you
win or lose all depends on luck, but over the long run, the winners are the
people who are the most disciplined: They have a trading plan, set limits and
stick to them, and can trade based on the data on the screen rather than on
emotions like hope, fear, and greed.
Unlike the options and futures markets, the stock market is not a zero-sum
game. As long as the economy grows, company profits grow, which in turn
lead to growing stock prices. The stock market really has more winners than
losers over the long run. That doesn’t mean that any given day will have
more winners than losers, however. In the short run, the stock market should
be treated like a zero-sum market.
If you understand how profits are divided in the markets that you choose to
trade, you have a better awareness of the risks that you face as well as the
risks that the other participants are taking. People do make money in zero-
sum markets, but you don’t want those winners to be making a profit off you.
Some traders make money — lots of money — doing what they like. Trading
is all about risk and reward. The traders who are rewarded risked the 80
percent washout rate. Knowing that, do you want to take the plunge? If so,
read on. And if not, read on anyway, because you may get some ideas that
can help you manage your other investments.
Being disciplined: Closing out each night
Day traders start each day fresh and finish each day with a clean slate. This
daily regimen reduces some of the risk, and it forces discipline. You can’t
keep your losers longer than a day, and you have to take your profits at the
end of the day before those winning positions turn into losers.
That discipline is important for day traders. When you day trade, you face
a market that does not know and does not care who you are, what you’re
doing, or what your personal or financial goals are. There’s no kindly boss
who may cut you a little slack today, no friendly coworker to help you
through a jam, no great client dropping you a little hint about her spending
plans for the next fiscal year. Unless you have rules in place to guide your
trading decisions, you’ll fall prey to hope, fear, doubt, and greed — the Four
Horsemen of trading ruin.

==================================================

Chapter 1: So You Want to Be a Day Trader
So how do you start? First you develop a business plan and a trading plan that
reflect your goals and your personality. Then you set your working days and
hours, and you accept that you’ll close out every night. Both of these steps
are covered in Chapter 2. As you think about the securities that you’ll trade
(Chapter 3) and how you may trade them (Part II), you’ll also want to test
your trading system (Chapter 16) to see how it may work in actual trading.
In other words, you prepare and have a plan. That’s a basic strategy for any
endeavor, whether you’re running a marathon, building a new garage, or
taking up day trading.
Committing to Trading As a Business
For many people, the attraction of day trading is that traders can very much
control their own hours. Many markets, like foreign exchange, trade around
the clock. With mobile trading apps, day trading seems like a way to make
money while the baby is napping, during your lunch hour, or on just a few
mornings a week in between golf games and woodworking.
That myth that day trading is an easy activity that you can do on the side actu-
ally does makes some traders very rich. Who are these traders? The profes-
sional traders who approach day trading as a business rather than a pastime.
They make money when traders who are not fully committed lose their money.
But day trading is a business, and the best traders approach it as such. They
have business plans for what they will trade, how they’ll invest in their busi-
ness, and how they’ll protect their trading profits. Therefore, much of this book
is about this business of trading: how to create a business plan (Chapter 2),
how to set up your office (Chapter 12), tax considerations (Chapter 15), and
performance evaluation (Chapter 16). If you catch a late-night infomercial about
trading, the story will be about the ease and the excitement. But if you want
that excitement to last, you have to make the commitment to doing trading as a
business to which you dedicate your time and your energy.
Trading part-time: An okay idea
if done right
Can you make money trading part-time? You can, and some people do.
Successful part-time day traders approach trading as a part-time job, not as
a little game to play when they have nothing else going on. A part-time trader
may commit to trading three days a week or to closing out at noon instead of



==================================================

==================================================

Part I: Getting Started with Day Trading
at the close of the market. A successful part-time trader still has a business
plan, still sets limits, and still acts like any professional trader would, just for
a smaller part of the day.
Part-time trading works best when you can set and maintain fixed business
hours. Working on a fixed schedule helps your brain know when to go to
work and concentrate on the market, because the habit is ingrained. The suc-
cessful part-timer operates as a professional with fixed hours. Think of it this
way: My son is a patient in a group pediatric practice that has some part-time
doctors. These part-time doctors keep set hours and behave like the other
doctors in the practice; the only difference is that they work fewer hours
each week. They commit their attention to medicine when they are on the
job, and patients only know about their part-time hours when it comes time
to make an appointment. These doctors don’t pop into the office and start
giving shots during their lunch break from their “real” job, sneaking around
so that their real boss doesn’t find out.
If you want to be a part-time day trader, approach it the same way that a part-
time doctor, part-time lawyer, or part-time accountant would approach work.
Find hours that fit your schedule and commit to trading during them. Have a
dedicated office space with high-speed Internet access and a computer that
you use just for trading. If you have children at home, you may need to have
child care during your trading hours. And if you have another job, set your
trading hours away from your work time. Trading via cellphone during your
morning commute is a really good way to lose a lot of money (not to mention
your life if you try it while driving).
Trading as a hobby: A bad idea
Because of the excitement of day trading and the supposed ease of doing it,
you may think that day trading makes a great hobby. On a boring Saturday
afternoon, you could just spend a few hours trading in the forex market
(foreign exchange) to make more money than if you spent those few hours
playing video games! Right?
Uh, no.
Trading without a plan and without committing the time and energy to do it
right is a route to losses. Professional traders are betting that plenty of suck-
ers are out there, trading in just such a random way because that creates the
losers that allow them to take profits in a zero-sum market.
The biggest mistake amateur traders make? Making a lot of money the first time
trading and then assuming that all such successes will come as easily. That first
success was almost definitely due to luck, and that luck can turn against a trader
on a dime. If you make money your first time out, take a step back and see

Chapter 1: So You Want to Be a Day Trader
whether you can figure out why. Then test your strategy, using Chapter 16 as a
guide, to see whether your strategy is a good one that you can use often.
Yes, I have two warnings in this section, and for good reason: Successful day
traders commit to their business. Even then, most day traders fail in their
first year. Brokerage firms, training services, and other traders have a vested
interest in making trading seem like an easy activity that you can work into
your life. But it’s a job — a job that some people love, but a job nonetheless.
If you really love the excitement of the markets, you can find ways to invest on
a hobbyist’s schedule: You can spend your time doing fundamental research
to find long-term investments (see Chapter 17 for information on that); you
can look into alternative investments to help diversify your portfolio (head to
Chapter 3); and you can trade with play money, either in demo accounts or in
trading contests, to try trading without committing real money.
Defining the Principles of
Successful Day Trading
Although you can day trade almost every asset with wild abandon, doing so
probably isn’t a good idea. Some traders spend their entire careers working
with just one or two types of securities. This section covers the basics of
success: working with just a few assets in one market, managing positions
carefully, and concentrating on the work at hand.
Working with a small number of assets
Most day traders pick one or two markets and concentrate on those to the
exclusion of all others. That way they can learn how the markets trade, how
news affects prices, and how the other participants react to new information.
Also, concentrating on just one or two markets helps a trader maintain focus.
And what do day traders trade? Chapter 3 has information on all of the differ-
ent markets and how they work, but here’s a quick summary, in no particular
order, of the most popular assets with day traders right now:
✓ Financial futures: Futures contracts allow traders to profit from price
changes in such market indexes as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones
Industrial Average. They give traders exposure to the prices at a much
lower cost than buying all the stocks in the index individually. Of course,
they tend to be more volatile than the indexes they track because they
are based on expectations.

Part I: Getting Started with Day Trading
✓ Forex: Forex, short for foreign exchange, involves trading in currencies
all over the world to profit from changes in exchange rates. Forex is the
largest and most liquid market there is, and it’s open for trading all day,
every day. Traders like the huge number of opportunities. Because most
price changes are small, they have to use leverage (borrowed money)
to make a profit. The borrowings have to be repaid no matter what
happens to the trade, which adds to the risk of forex.
✓ Common stock and exchange-traded funds: The entire business of day
trading began in the stock market, and the stock market continues to
be popular with day traders. They look for news on company perfor-
mance and investor perception that affect stock prices, and they look to
make money from those price changes. A similar asset is the exchange-
traded fund, which trades like a stock but is based on a market index or
strategy. The big drawback? Stock and ETF traders can get killed at tax
time if they aren’t careful. See Chapter 15 for more information.
Managing your positions
A key to successful trading is knowing how much you’re going to trade and
when you’re going to get out of your position. Sure, day traders are always
going to close out at the end of the day — or they wouldn’t be day traders —
but they also need to cut their losses and take their profits as they occur
during the day. Specifically, they need to determine the size of the trade and
the maximum profit or loss:
✓ Determining what portion of their money they risk for any particular
trade: Traders rarely place all their money on one trade. That’s a good
way to lose it! Instead, they trade just some of their money, keeping the
rest to make other trades as new opportunities in the market present
themselves. If any one trade fails, the trader still has money to place
new trades. Some traders divide their money into fixed proportions, and
others determine how much money to trade based on the expected risk
and expected return of the security they’re trading. Careful money man-
agement helps a trader stay in the game longer, and the longer a trader
stays in, the better the chance of making good money. Chapter 6 has
more information on money-management strategies.
✓ Protecting their funds by using stop and limit orders: Stop and limit
orders are placed with the brokerage firm and kick in whenever the
security reaches a predetermined price level. If the security starts to
fall in price more than the trader likes — bam! — it’s sold, and no more
losses will occur on that trade. The trader doesn’t agonize over the
decision or second-guess herself. Instead, she just moves on to the next
trade, putting her money to work on a trade that’s likely to be better.

Chapter 1: So You Want to Be a Day Trader
Day traders make a lot of trades, and a lot of those trades are going to be
losers. The key is to have more winners than losers. By limiting the amount of
losses, the trader makes it easier for the gains to be big enough to generate
more than enough money to make up for the losers.
Focusing your attention
Day traders are often undone by stress and emotion. Keeping a steady eye on
what’s happening in the market is hard when you’re looking at screens all day
and working alone. But as a trader, you have to be able to concentrate on the
market and stick to your trading system, staying as calm and rational as possible.
Day traders who do well have support systems in place. They are able to
close their positions and spend the rest of the day on other activities. They
do something to get rid of their excess energy and clear their minds, such as
running or yoga or meditation. They understand that their ability to maintain
a clear mind when the market is open is crucial.
Traders sometimes think of the market itself, or everyone else who is trading,
as the enemy. The real enemies are emotions: doubt, fear, greed, and hope.
Those four feelings keep traders from concentrating on the market and stick-
ing to their systems.
One of the frustrations of trading is that some days offer more opportunities
to trade than you have time or money to trade. On these days, good trades get
away from you because you simply don’t have the resources to take advantage
of every opportunity you see. That’s why having a plan and concentrating on
what works for you are so important.
Identifying the Personality Traits of
Successful Day Traders
Successful traders are a special breed. They can be blunt and crude, because
they act fast against a market that has absolutely no consideration for them.
For all their rough exterior, they maintain strict discipline about how they
approach their trading day and what they do during market hours.
The discipline begins with a plan for how to start the day, including reviews
of news events and trading patterns. It includes keeping track of trades made
during the day, to help the trader figure out what works and why. And it
depends on cutting losses as they occur, reaping all profits that appear,

and refining a set of trading rules so that tomorrow will be even better. No,
this strategy isn’t as much fun as just jumping in and placing orders, but it’s
more likely to lead to success.
Not everyone can be a day trader, nor should everyone try it. In this section,
I cover some of the traits that the best day traders possess.
Independence
For the most part, day traders work by themselves. Computers and monitors
are relatively inexpensive, high-speed Internet connectivity is easier to get,
and many brokerage firms cater to the needs of traders who are working by
themselves — all of which leaves the day trader at home, alone, stuck in a
room with nothing but the computer screen for company. Being alone all day
may be boring and make it hard to concentrate. Some people can’t handle it.
But other traders thrive on being alone all day, because it brings out their
best qualities. They know that their trading depends on them alone, not on
anyone else. The trader has sole responsibility when something goes wrong,
but he also gets to keep all the spoils. He can make his own decisions about
what works and what doesn’t, with no pesky boss or annoying corporate
drone telling him what he needs to do today.
If the idea of being in charge of your own business and your own trading
account is exciting, then day trading may be a good career option for you.
What if you want to trade but don’t want to work by yourself? Consider going
to work for a brokerage firm, a hedge fund, a mutual fund, or a commodities
company. These businesses need traders to manage their own money, and
they usually have large numbers of people working together on their trading
desks to share ideas, cheer each other on, and give each other support when
things go wrong.
No matter how independent you are, your trading will benefit if you have
friends and family to offer you support and encouragement. That network can
help you better manage the emotional aspects of trading. Besides, celebrating
your success is more fun with someone else!
Quick-wittedness
Day trading is a game of minutes. An hour may as well be a decade when the
markets are moving fast. And that means a day trader can’t be deliberative or
panicky. When it’s time to buy or sell, it’s time to buy or sell, period.

Chapter 1: So You Want to Be a Day Trader
Many investors prefer to spend hours doing a careful study of a security and
markets before committing money. Some of these people are enormously suc-
cessful. Warren Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, amassed $54 billion
from his careful investing style, money that he is giving to charity. But Buffett
and people like him are not traders.
Traders have to have enough trust in their system and enough experience in
the markets to act quickly when they see a buy or sell opportunity. Many bro-
kerage firms offer their clients demonstration accounts or backtesting ser-
vices that enable traders to work with their system before committing actual
dollars, helping them learn to recognize market patterns that signal potential
profits.
A trader with a great system who isn’t quick on the mouse button has
another option: automating trades. Many brokerage firms offer software that
executes trades automatically whenever certain market conditions occur. For
many traders, automatic trades are a perfect way to take the emotion out of
a trading strategy. Others dislike this type of trading, because it takes some
of the fun out of the job. And let’s face it, successful traders find the whole
process to be a good time.
Decisiveness
Day traders have to move quickly, so they also have to be able to make
decisions quickly. You can’t wait until tomorrow to see how the charts play
out before committing capital. If you see an opportunity, you have to go
with it. Now.
But what if the decision is a bad one? Well, of course some decisions are
going to be bad. That’s the risk of making any kind of an investment, and
without risk, there is no return. Anyone playing around in the markets has to
accept that.
But two good day-trading practices help limit the effects of making a bad
decision. The first is the use of stop and limit orders, which automatically
close out losing positions. The second is closing out all positions at the end
of every day, which lets you start fresh the next day.
If you have some downside protection in place, you’re more psychologically
prepared to make the decisions you need to make in order to earn a profit.
And if you’re one of those people who has a hard time making a decision, day
trading probably isn’t right for you.

Seeing What Day Trading Is Not
So much mythology surrounds day trading: Day traders lose money. Day
traders make money. Day traders are insane. Day traders are cold and rational.
Day trading is easy. Day trading is a direct path to alcoholism and ruin.
In this section, I bust a few day trading myths. Someone has to do it, right?
You find both good news and bad news in this section, so read it through to
get some perspective on what, exactly, you can expect from day trading.
It’s not investing
While swing traders hold positions for a few days, maybe even a few weeks,
and investors hold their stakes for the long term, with some looking to hang
onto their securities for decades and maybe even hand them down to their
children, day traders never hold a position for more than a day.
Day trading is most definitely not investing. Day traders perform an impor-
tant function to the capital markets because they force the price changes that
bring the supply and demand of the market into balance. Day trading, how-
ever, doesn’t create new sources of funding for companies and governments.
It doesn’t generate long-term growth.
Just because day trading isn’t investing doesn’t mean day traders don’t have
investments elsewhere. Many day traders withdraw their trading capital on a
regular basis to put into investments, helping them build a long-term portfolio
for their retirement or for other ventures they may want to take on. Still,
because investing and trading have different mindsets, chances are the trader
will have someone else manage this money.
It’s not gambling
One of the biggest knocks on day trading is that it’s just another form of gam-
bling. And as everyone knows, or should know, in gambling, the odds always
favor the house. That’s not the case with day trading, however. Consider
these points:
✓ In day trading, the odds are even in many markets. The options and
futures markets, for example, are zero-sum markets with as many win-
ners as losers, but those markets also include people looking to hedge
risk and who thus have lower profit expectations than do day traders.

==================================================

19
Chapter 1: So You Want to Be a Day Trader
✓ The stock market has the potential for more winning trades than
losing trades, especially over the long run. For this reason, the stock
market isn’t a zero-sum market, like options and futures markets. In the
stock market, the odds are ever so slightly in the trader’s favor.
In all markets, the prepared and disciplined trader can do better than the fran-
tic, naïve trader. That’s not the case when gambling, because no matter how
prepared the gambler is, the casino has the upper hand.
People with gambling problems sometimes turn to day trading as a socially
acceptable way to feed their addiction. If you know you have a gambling prob-
lem or suspect you are at risk, taking up day trading is probably not a good
idea for you. Day traders who are closet gamblers tend to make bad trades
and have trouble setting limits and closing out at the end of the day. They turn
the odds against themselves. Chapter 4 has some information on the line
between day trading and gambling.
It’s not dangerous — if you use
risk capital
A lot of day traders lose money, and some lose everything that they start with.
Others don’t lose all of their trading capital; they just decide that there are
better uses of their time and better ways to make money. (For more on day
trading success rates, head to the later section “Looking at Success Rates.”)
A responsible trader works with risk capital, which is money that she can
afford to lose. She uses stop and limit orders to minimize her losses, and
she always closes out at the end of the day. She understands the risks and
rewards of trading, and that keeps her sane.
Many day trading strategies rely on leverage, which is the use of borrowed
money to increase potential returns. Leverage carries the risk of the trader
losing more money than is in his account. However, brokerage firms, which
don’t want that to happen, will probably close a leveraged account that’s in
danger of going under. That’s good, because it limits your potential loss.
It’s not easy
Along with the relatively low rate of success, day trading is really stressful.
Concentrating on the markets and knowing that real money is at stake takes
a lot of energy. The profit amounts on any one trade are likely to be small,
which means you have to be persistent and keep placing trades until the end
of the day.

Some traders can’t handle the stress. Some get bored. Some get frustrated.
And some can’t believe that they can make a living doing something that
they love.
Looking at Success Rates
Given the participation of day traders in securities markets, researchers
are always trying to figure out whether they make money. And the answers
aren’t good.
Yes, most day traders fail — about 80 percent in the first year, as I note ear-
lier. But so do a large percentage of people who start new businesses or enter
other occupations. That’s why I’ve combed through several different reports
and databases to show how well people do in other fields. (My sources
are Realty Times; Barber, Lee, Liu, and Odean; American College of Sports
Medicine; ACT; Ohio State University; and the National Center for Education
Statistics.)
Field First-Year Failure Rate
Real estate sales 86%
Day trading 80%
Training for a marathon 70%
College enrollment 33%
Restaurants 26%
Teaching 13%
If you understand the risks and keep them in perspective, you’ll be better
able to handle the slings and arrows of misfortune on the way to your goal.
Day trading is difficult, but it’s not impossible. You can improve your chances
of success by taking the time to prepare and by having enough money to fund
your initial trading account. During the first year, you’ll want to handle trading
losses and still be able to pay your rent and buy your groceries. Knowing that
you can cover your basic expenses will give you more confidence, and that
can help your performance.

Although day trading is tough, many day traders can’t imagine doing any-
thing else. The simple fact is that a lot of occupations are difficult ways to
make a living, and yet they are right for some people. Every career has its
advantages and disadvantages, and day trading is no different.
When you finish this book, you should have a good sense of whether or not
day trading is right for you. If you realize that it’s the career you have been
searching for, you can find lots of good ideas in the coming chapters for how
to set up your day-trading business and plenty of advice on how to increase
your chances of success.
If you find that maybe day trading isn’t right for you, I hope you get some
ideas that can help you manage your long-term investments better. After all,
the attention to price movements, timing, and risk that is critical to a day
trader’s success can help any investor improve his returns. What’s not to

ay trading is sometimes presented as a profitable hobby. Anyone who
buys a day-trading DVD course via infomercial can make money easily
in just a few hours a week, right? Well, no. Day trading is a job. It can be a
full-time job or a part-time job, but it requires the same commitment to
working regular hours and the same dedication to learning a craft and
honing skills as any other job.
The best traders have plans for their business and for their trades. They
know in advance how they want to trade and what they expect to do when
they face the market. They may, at times, find themselves deviating from
their plans, due to luck or circumstance or changing markets, but in those
cases, they understand why they’re trying something else.
Trading comes in many flavors, and many of those who call themselves
day traders are actually doing other things with their money. If you know
in advance what you want to do, not only will you be less likely to panic or
follow fads, but you’ll also be in a better position to take advantage of
opportunities in a way that suits your personality, trading skills, and goals.
And that’s why this entire chapter is devoted to planning.
Failing to plan is planning to fail. And if you can’t remember that right now,
don’t worry. I repeat it several times in this book.

Planning Your Trading Business
The day trader is an entrepreneur who has started a small business that
trades in securities in hopes of making a return. You can get your business
off to a good start if you have a plan for what you want to do and how you’re
going to do it. With a plan, you know what your goals are and what you need
to do to achieve them.
You can find a lot of sample business plans in books and on the Internet,
but most of them are not appropriate for a trader. A typical business plan is
designed to not only guide the business but also to attract outside financing.
Unless you’re going to take in partners or borrow money from an outside
source, your day trading business plan is only for you. No executive
summary and no pages of projections needed.
So what do you need instead? How about a list of your goals and a plan for
what you’ll trade, what your hours will be, what equipment you’ll need, and
how much to invest in the business? The following sections have the details.
Setting your goals
The first thing you need in your plan is a list of your goals, both short term
and long term. Here is a sample list of key questions to get you started:
✓ Where do you want to be with your career and your life in the next
three months, six months, nine months, year, three years, five years,
and ten years?
✓ How many days a year do you want to trade?
✓ What do you need to know to trade better?
✓ How much do you want to make?
✓ What will you do with your profits?
✓ How will you reward yourself when you hit your goals?
Be as specific as possible when you think about what you want to do with
your trading business and don’t worry if your business goals overlap with
your personal goals. When you are in business for yourself, the two often mix.
You may be tempted to say, “I want to make as much money as I possibly can,”
and forget the rest, but “as much as I can” isn’t a quantifiable goal. If you don’t
know that you’ve reached your goal, how can you go on to set new ones? And
if you don’t meet your goal, how will you know how to make changes?

Finding volatility
You can day trade so many different securities and derivatives! Sure, you
want to trade anything that makes money for you, but what on earth is that?
Each market has its own nuances, so if you flit from futures to forex (foreign
exchange), you may be courting disaster. But if you know what markets you
want to trade, you have a better sense of what research services you need,
what ongoing training you may want to consider, and how to evaluate your
performance.
Chapter 3 covers different asset classes in great detail and discusses how you
may use them. For now, the little cheat sheet in Table 2-1 lists asset classes
that are most popular with day traders. Think about your chosen markets
in the same way: What do you want to trade, where will you trade it, what is
the risk and return, and what are some of the characteristics that make this
market attractive to you?

What do zero sum, leverage, and upward bias mean? Well, zero sum means
that for every winner, there is a loser. The market has no net gain. Leverage is
the use of borrowed money, which increases potential return as well as risk.
Upward bias means that, in the long run, the market is expected to increase in
price, but that doesn’t mean it will go up on any given day that you’re trading.
The characteristics of the different markets and assets affect both your
business plan and your trading plan. The business plan should include
information on what you’ll trade and why, as well as what you hope to learn
to trade in the future. The trading plan looks at what you want to trade each
day and why so that you can channel your efforts.
Many day traders work in several different markets, depending on their
temperament and trading conditions, but successful traders have narrowed
the field down to the few markets where they want to concentrate their
efforts. Start slowly, working just one or two different securities, and consider
adding new markets as your experience and trading capital grows.
Fixing hours, vacation, and sick leave
The markets are open more or less continuously. Although many exchanges
have set trading hours, you can find traders working after hours who are
willing to sell if you want to buy. Some markets, such as foreign exchange,
take only the briefest of breaks over the course of a week, which gives
day traders incredible flexibility. No matter what hours and what days are
best for you to trade, you can find something that works for you. If you’re
sharpest in the evenings, for example, you may be better off trading Asian
currencies, because those markets are active when you are. Of course, an
always-open market can be a disadvantage, because no one is setting limits
for you. Few markets are great places to trade every hour of every day.
If you want to, you can trade almost all the time. But you probably don’t
want to. To keep your sanity, maintain your perspective, and have a life
outside of your trading, you should set regular hours and stick to them. In
your business plan, determine when you’re going to trade, how often you’re
going to take a vacation, how many sick days you’ll give yourself, and how
you’ll know to take a day off. One of the joys of self-employment is that you
can take time off when you need to, so give yourself that little perk in your
business plan.
Trading is a stressful business. You need to take time off to clear your head,
and you’ll probably find that working while sick is a sure-fire route to losses.
Build in some sick and vacation time — and read Chapter 14 for more
information on how to manage the stress of the markets.

Chapter 2: Planning to Succeed As a Day Trader
Getting yourself set up
Part of your business plan should cover where you work and what equipment
you need. (Chapter 12 has some ideas on that subject.) What can you afford
now, and what is on your wish list? Do you have enough computing equipment,
the right Internet connection, and a working filing system? Determining what
you have and how you’ll get what you need is part of your plan for getting your
business underway, so put some thought into your infrastructure.
And yes, setting up business space and investing in equipment are important.
You don’t want to lose a day of trading because your computer crashes, nor
do you want to be stuck with an open position because your Internet service
provider has a temporary outage. And you certainly don’t want to lose your
concentration because you’re trying to work in the family room while other
members of your household are playing video games.
Investing in your business
You won’t have the time and money to do everything you want to do in your
trading business, so part of your business plan should include a list of things
that you want to add over time. A key part of investing in your business is
continuous improvement: No matter how good a trader you are now, you
can always be better. Furthermore, the markets are always changing. New
products come to market, new trading regulations are passed, and new
technologies appear. You need to continuously absorb new things, and
part of your business plan should consider that. Ask yourself
✓ What percentage of your time and trade gains will go into expanding
your knowledge of trading?
✓ Do you want to gain this additional knowledge by taking seminars or
by allocating the time to simulation test (head to Chapter 16 for more
on that)?
✓ What upgrades will you make to your trading equipment? How about to
your programming capabilities?
✓ How are you going to set yourself up to stay in trading for the long haul?
It takes money to make money — another cliché. This maxim doesn’t mean,
however, that you should spend money willy-nilly on any nifty gadget or fancy
video seminar that comes your way. Instead, it means that an ongoing,
thoughtful investment in your trading business will pay off in a greater
likelihood of long-run success.

Evaluating and revising your plan
One component of your business plan should be a plan for revising it. Things
are going to change. Since the first edition of this book came out, exchanges
have merged, the market has crashed, and high-frequency trading has
become the norm. You may be more or less successful than you hope, market
conditions may change on you, and you may simply find out more about how
you trade best. So set a plan for updating your business plan to reflect where
you are and where you want to be as you go along. At least once a year, and
more often if you feel the need for a change, go through your business plan
and revise it to reflect where you are now. What are your new goals? What
are your new investment plans? What are you doing right, and what needs
to change?
Business plans are living documents. Use your plan to run your trading
business; as your business runs, use the results to update your plan. You can
keep the old ones around to show you how much progress you have made, if
you’re so inclined.

Planning Your Trades
A good trader has a plan. She knows what she wants to trade and how to
trade it. She knows what her limits are before she places the order. She’s not
afraid to take a loss now in order to prevent a bigger loss in the future, and
she’s willing to sit out the market if nothing is happening that day. Her plan
gives her the discipline to protect her capital so that she has money in her
account when the opportunities present themselves.
In this section, I cover the components of trade planning. When you start
trading, you’ll probably write notes each day to set up a trading plan that
covers what you expect for the day, what trades you hope to make, and
what your profit goals and loss limit are. As you develop experience, trade
planning may become innate. You develop the discipline to trade according
to plan without needing to write it all down — although you may find it useful
to tape a list of the day’s expected announcements to your monitor.
Like a business plan, a trading plan is flexible. The markets don’t know what
you’ve planned, and you’ll probably end up deviating on more than one
occasion. The key thing is knowing why you deviated: Was it because of the
information that you saw when you were looking at your screen, or was it
because you became panicky?
What do you want to trade?
The first step in your trading plan should also be addressed in your
business plan: What do you want to trade? Many traders work in more
than one market, and each market is a little different. Some trade different
products simultaneously, whereas others choose one for the day and work
only on that.
You need to figure out which markets give you the best chance of getting a
profit that day, and this changes regularly. Some days, no trades will be good
for you in one market, and you’ll be better off sitting out. If you’re too antsy
to sit out, then find another market to keep you busy so that you don’t trade
just to stay awake. (Of course, many traders report that the big money
opportunities are in the slower, less glamorous markets.)
As a day trader, you’re self-employed. You don’t answer to a boss, and you
don’t have to trade on any particular day if you don’t want to. So if you
have a headache, if no good trades are available to you, or if recent losses
have gotten you down, take the day off and do something fun.

Chapter 2: Planning to Succeed As a Day Trader
How do you want to trade?
Figuring out how to trade an asset involves a lot of considerations: What is
your mood today? What will other traders be reacting to today? How much
risk do you want to take? How much money do you want to commit? These
considerations represent the nitty-gritty stage of trade planning that can help
you manage your market day better.
Starting the day with a morning review
Before you start trading, take some time to determine where your head is
relative to the market. Is today a day that you can concentrate? Are things
happening in your life that may distract you, are you coming down with the
flu, or were you out too late last night? Or are you raring to go, ready to take
on whatever the day brings? Your mindset should influence how aggressively
you want to trade and how much risk you want to take. You have to pay
attention to do well in the markets, but you also have to know when to hang
back during the day’s activities. For example, many traders find that their
strategies work best at certain times of the day, such as at the open or before
major news announcements.
After you determine your own mindset, think about what people will be
reacting to that day. Go through the newspapers and check the online news-
wires to gather information. Then figure out the answers to these questions:
✓ Are big news announcements scheduled for today? At what time? Do you
want to trade ahead of the news, or do you want to wait and see what
the market does?
✓ Did something happen overnight? Will that event affect trading on the
open, or is it already in the markets? Do you want to trade on the open
or wait?
✓ What are the other people — those who trade the same future,
commodity, stock, or currency that you do — worried about today?
How are they likely to respond? Do you want to go with the market or
strike a contrary position?
Drawing up a sample order
After you have a sense of how you’re going to tackle the day, determine how
much you’re going to trade. Following are the key considerations:
✓ Do you want to be long or short? That is, do you want to bet that the
asset you are trading is going up in price or down?
✓ Do you want to borrow money? If so, how much? Borrowing — also
known as margin or leverage — increases your potential return as well
as your risk. (I discuss margin, leverage, and short selling in Chapter 9.)



==================================================
                     PAGE 48                      
==================================================

32
Part I: Getting Started with Day Trading
Some contracts, such as futures, have built-in leverage. As soon as you
decide to trade them, you’re borrowing money.
✓ How much money do you want to trade? Think about this both in
dollars and as a percentage of your total account size. (I discuss
money management in detail in Chapter 6.)
With these items detailed, you’re in good shape to get started for the day.
Figuring out when to buy and when to sell
After you get insight into what the day may be like and how much money you
want to allocate to the markets, your next step is to figure out when you’ll
buy and when you’ll sell. Ah, but if deciding when to buy and sell were easy,
do you think I’d be revising a book on day trading? No. I’d be too busy taking
private surfing lessons in front of my beachfront mansion on Maui.
The very best traders aren’t selling trading advice, because they’re already
retired. Everyone else is figuring it out as they go along, with varying degrees
of success.
Many traders rely on technical analysis, which involves looking at patterns
in charts of the price and volume changes (I discuss technical analysis in
Chapter 7). Other traders look at news and price information as the market
changes rather than looking at price patterns (you can find a discussion of
this in Chapter 8). Still others care only about very short-term price discrep-
ancies (covered in Chapter 10). But the most important thing, no matter what
approach you prefer, is that you backtest and simulate your trading before
you commit real dollars. That way, you have a better sense of how you’ll
react in real market conditions. You can find backtesting in Chapter 16.
Setting profit goals
When you trade, you want to have a realistic idea how much money you can
make. What’s a fair profit? Do you want to ride a winning position until the end
of the day, or do you want to get out quickly after you make enough money to
compensate for your risk? This question has no one single answer because so
much depends on market conditions and your trading style. In this section are
some guidelines that can help you determine what’s best for you.
Your profit goals can be sliced and diced a few different ways. The first is the
gain per trade on both a percentage basis and an absolute basis. The second

Chapter 2: Planning to Succeed As a Day Trader
is the gain per day on both a percentage basis and an absolute basis. What
do you have to do to reach these goals? How many successful trades will
you have to make? Do you have the capital to do that? And what is right for
the trade you are making right now, regardless of what your longer-term
goals are?
No one ever lost money taking a profit, as the cliché goes. (The trading
business is rife with clichés, if you haven’t noticed.) The newer you are to
day trading, the more sense it makes to be conservative. Close your positions
and end your day when you reach a target profit and then make note of what
happens afterward. Can you afford to hold on to your positions longer to
make a greater profit?

Part I: Getting Started with Day Trading
Setting limits on your trades
Setting a loss limit along with a profit goal is a good idea. For example, many
futures traders have a rule to risk two ticks in pursuit of three ticks. That
means that they’ll sell a position as soon as it loses two ticks in value and as
soon as it gains three ticks in value. And for anything in between? Well, they
close out their positions at the end of the day, so whatever happens happens.
Even traders who do not have a rule like that often set a limit on how much
they’ll lose per trade. Other traders use computer programs to guide their
buys and their sells, so they sell their positions automatically. Brokers make
setting limits easy by giving customers the choice of a stop order or a limit
order to protect their positions.
You want to limit your loss per trade as well as your loss per day. If today is
not a good one, close up shop, take a break, and come back fresh tomorrow.
Stop orders
A stop order is an order to buy or sell a security as soon as a security moves
beyond the current market price. A stop buy order is set above the current
market price, and it is used to manage a short position. A stop sell order is set
at a price below where the market is now, and it is used to protect a profit or
limit a loss on a security that you already own. If you want to make sure you
sell a block of stock when it falls below $30 per share, for example, you can
enter a stop order at $30 (telling your broker “Sell Stop 30”). As soon as the
stock hits or goes below $30, the broker sells it, even if the price goes to $29
or $31 before all the stock is sold. This is often known as a stop loss order.
A version of a stop, known as a trailing stop, is used to help protect a profit.
You can enter a trailing stop order at the current market with a stop loss
price below the current market price. It would be set to trail, or automatically
increase, as the stock price does. If you bought a block of stock at $30 with a
trailing stop of $5, for example, the stop would kick in at $25. But if your trade
was a good one and the stock went from $30 to $35, the stop would trail with
it and rise to $30, a price $5 below the current market value.
Limit orders
A limit order is an order to buy or sell a security at a specific price or better:
lower than the current price for the buy order (because you want to buy low,
naturally), higher than the specific price for a sell order (because you want to
sell high).
If you want to make sure you sell a block of stock when it’s at $30 per share,
for example, you can enter a limit order at $30 (telling your broker, “Sell Limit
30”). As soon as the stock hits $30, the broker sells it, continuing to place
the order as long as the price stays at $30 or higher. If the price goes even a

Chapter 2: Planning to Succeed As a Day Trader
penny below $30, the limit is no longer enforced, and the broker stops selling
your position. After all, no buyers are going to want to pay an above-market
price just so you can get your order completed!
Stop-limit orders
A stop-limit order is a combination of a stop order and a limit order. It tells
the broker to buy or sell at a specific price or better but only after the price
passes a given stop price. If, for example, you want to make sure you sell a
block of stock when it falls below $30 per share but you also want to make
sure you sell it only when you’d have a loss, you can enter a stop order at
$30 with a limit of $29 (telling your broker, “Sell 30 Limit 29”). As soon as the
stock hits $30, the broker sells it as long as the price stays above $29. If it
goes below $29, the broker stops selling. Stop-limit orders help you get out
without maximizing your losses; the danger, of course, is that the stock goes
to $6 and you could have gotten out at $28 without the stop-limit order.
Are you confused? Well, the differences may be confusing, but understand-
ing them is important to helping you manage your risks. That’s why Table 2-2
gives you a handy breakout of the different types of orders.

Order cancels other
Also known as one cancels other or OCO, an order cancels other order is used
with a limit and a stop-loss to set a trading bracket in a volatile market. The
limit sets an automatic exit point when your position hits your price target,
and the stop-loss kicks in if your trade moves against you in order to limit
your losses. The broker will execute only the relevant order, cancelling the
other order when that happens. If not, the other half of the order will be
hanging out, waiting to be executed, causing you headaches.
Order sends other
Depending on who you talk to, OSO stands for order sends order, order sends
other, or one sends other. They all mean the same thing: When one order is
executed, another order is automatically entered into the system — and not
a moment before. You use an OSO to enter a limit order or a stop-loss order
as soon as your order to open a long or short position is executed.
What if the trade goes wrong?
No matter how in tune you feel with the market, no matter how good your
track record, and no matter how disciplined you are with setting stops, stuff
is going to happen. Just as you can make more money than you plan to, you
can also lose a lot more. If you day trade, you have to accept that you’re
going to have some really bad days.
So what do you do? You suck it up, take the loss, and get on with your life.
Yes, the market may have blown past your stops. That happens sometimes,
and it’s hard to watch real dollars disappear into someone else’s account,
someone you will never know. Still, close your position and just remember
that tomorrow is another day with another chance to do better.

Part I: Getting Started with Day Trading
After you take the loss and clear your head, see whether you can learn some-
thing for next time. Sometimes a loss can teach you valuable lessons that
make you a smarter, more disciplined trader in the long run.
Closing Out Your Position
By definition, day traders only hold their investment positions for a single
day. Closing out at the end of the day is important for a few reasons:
✓ Closing out daily reduces your risk of something happening overnight.
✓ Margin rates — the interest rates paid on money borrowed for trading —
are low and in some cases zero for day traders, but the rates go up
on overnight balances.
✓ Good trade discipline is what can keep you from making expensive
mistakes.
But like all rules, the single-day rule can be broken and probably should
be broken sometimes. In this section, I cover a few longer-term trading
strategies that you may want to add to your trading business on occasion.
Swing trading: Holding for days
Swing trading involves holding a position for several days. Some swing trad-
ers hold overnight, while others hold for days or even months. The longer
time period gives more time for a position to work out, which is especially
important if the position is based on news events or if it requires taking a
position contrary to the current market sentiment. Although swing trading
gives traders more options for making a profit, it carries some risks because
the position can turn against you while you are away from the markets.
A tradeoff always exists between risk and return. When you take more risk,
you do so in the hopes of getting a greater return. But when you look for a way
to increase return, remember that you have to take on more risk to do it.
Swing trading requires paying attention to some basic fundamentals and
news flow. (Fundamental research is discussed in Chapter 7.) It’s also a good
choice for people who have the discipline to go to bed at night instead of
waiting up and watching their position in hopes that nothing goes wrong.

Chapter 2: Planning to Succeed As a Day Trader
Position trading: Holding for weeks
A position trader holds a stake in a stock or a commodity for several weeks
and possibly even for months. This person is attracted to the short-term
price opportunities, but he also believes that he can make more money
holding the stake for a long enough period of time to see business funda-
mentals play out. Position trading increases the risk and the potential return
because a lot more can happen over months than minutes.
Investing: Holding for months or years
An investor is not a trader. Investors do careful research and buy a stake in an
asset in the hopes of building a profit over the long term. It’s not unusual for
investors to hold assets for decades, although good ones sell quickly if they
realize that they’ve made a mistake or if the story changes. (They want to cut
their losses early, just as any good trader should.)
Investors are concerned about the prospects of the underlying business.
Will it make money? Will it pay off its debts? Will it hold its value? They view
short-term price fluctuations as noise rather than as profit opportunities.
Many traders pull out some of their profits to invest for the long term (or
to give to someone else, such as a mutual-fund manager or hedge fund, to
invest). Doing so is a way of building financial security in the pursuit of
longer goals. This money is usually kept separate from the trading account.
Maxims and Clichés That Guide and
Mislead Traders
In this chapter, I cover a few of the many maxims traders use to think about
their trading, such as
✓ The stock doesn’t know you own it.
✓ Failing to plan is planning to fail.
✓ Your first loss is your best loss.
A lot more are out there.

Part I: Getting Started with Day Trading
Clichés are useful shorthand for important rules that can help you plan your
trading. But they can also mislead you because some are really obvious —
too obvious to act on effectively. Yes, everyone knows that you make money
by buying low and selling high, but how do you tell what low is and high is?
Here’s a run-through of some clichés that you’ll come across in your trading
career, along with my take on what they mean.
Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered
Trading is pure capitalism, and people do it for one primary reason: to make
money. Sure, a ton of economic benefits come from having well-functioning
capital markets, such as better price prediction, risk management, and
capital formation. But a day trader just wants to make money.
Get too greedy, however, and you’re likely to get stupid. You start taking too
much risk, deviating too much from your strategy, and getting careless about
dealing with your losses. Good traders know when it’s time to take a profit
and move on to the next trade.
This maxim is one of those obvious but tough-to-follow ones. After all, when
do you cross the line from being a happy little piggy to a big fat greedy hog
that’s about to be turned into a pork belly? Just know that if you’re deviating
from your trading plan because things are going so great, you may be headed
for some trouble.
Here’s a cliché that’s related to “Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered”: “Bears
get fat, bulls get fat, and hogs get slaughtered.” In other words, a savvy trader
can make money whether the market is up or down, but a greedy trader runs
into trouble.
In a bear market, the money returns to its
rightful owners
A bull market is one that charges ahead; a bear market is one that does
poorly. Many people erroneously think of themselves as trading geniuses
because they make money when the entire market is going up. Making money
by day trading was easy with Internet stocks in 1999, but it wasn’t so easy
in 2000 when the bubble burst. And when the markets turn negative, those
people who really understand trading and who know how to manage risk are
able to stay in until things get better, possibly even making nice profits along
the way.

Chapter 2: Planning to Succeed As a Day Trader
The corollary cliché for “In a bear market, the money returns to its rightful
owners,” is “Don’t confuse brains with a bull market.” When things are going
well, watch out for overconfidence. It may be time to update your business
and trading plans, but it’s not to time cast them aside.
The trend is your friend
When you day trade, you need to make money fast. You do not have the
luxury of waiting for your unique, contrary theory to play out. An investor
may be buying a stock in the hopes of holding it for decades, but a trader
needs things to work now.
Given the short-term nature of the market, short-term sentiment is going to
trump long-term fundamentals. People trading today may be wrong about the
direction of foreign exchange, interest rates, or stock prices, but if you are
closing out your positions tonight, you need to work with the information in
the market today. In the short run, traders who fight the market lose money.
There are two problems with the maxim “The trend is your friend.” The first
is that by the time you identify a trend, it may be over. Second, sometimes,
going against the herd makes sense because you can collect when everyone
else realizes their mistake. In such a situation, the psychology of trading
comes into play. Are you a good enough judge of human behavior to know
when the trend is right and when it’s not?
Buy the rumor, sell the news
Markets react to information. That’s ultimately what drives supply and
demand. Although the market tends to react quickly to information, it can
overreact, too. Lots of gossip gets traded in the markets as everyone looks to
get the information they need to gain an advantage. And despite such things
as confidentiality agreements and insider-trading laws, many rumors turn out
to be true.
These rumors are often attached to such news events as corporate earnings.
For whatever reason — good news, analyst research, a popular product —
traders may believe, for example, that the company will report good quar-
terly earnings per share. That’s the rumor. If you buy on the rumor, you can
take advantage of the price appreciation as the story gets more play. When
the earnings are actually announced, one of two things will happen:



==================================================

==================================================

42
Part I: Getting Started with Day Trading
✓ The earnings will be as good as or better than rumored, and the price
will go up. The trader can sell into that and make a profit.
✓ The earnings will be worse than rumored, everyone will sell on the bad
news, and the trader will want to sell to get out of the loss.
Of course, if the rumor is bad, you want to do the opposite: sell on the
rumor and buy on the news. For more information on short selling —
selling securities in hopes that they fall in price — turn to Chapter 9.
The problem with “Buy the rumor, sell the news” is that rumors are often
wrong, and there may be more opportunities to buy on bad news when
other traders are panicking, thus driving prices down for a few minutes
before sanity sets in. But this rule is one of those that everyone talks about,
whether or not they actually follow it.
Cut your losses and ride your winners
I mention earlier in this chapter that you need to cut your losses before they
drag you down. No matter how much it hurts and no matter how much you
believe that you’re right, you need to close out a losing position and move on.
But the opposite — that you should ride your winners — is not necessarily
true. Although good traders tend to be disciplined about selling winning
positions, they don’t use stops and limits as rigorously on the upside as they
may on the downside. They’re likely to stick with a profit and see how high it
goes before closing out a position.
Note that this conflicts a little with the “Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered”
maxim. (Trading maxims can be so contradictory!) To prevent overconfi-
dence and sloppiness from greed, ride your winners within reason. If your
general discipline is to risk three ticks on a futures contract to make five, and
a contract goes up six ticks before you can close it out, you may want to stick
with it. But if you also close out at the end of every day, don’t give in to the
temptation of keeping that position open just because it’s still going up. Keep
to your overall discipline.
You’re only as good as your last trade
The markets churn on every day with little regard for why everyone
trading right now is there. Prices go up and down to match the supply

and the demand at any given moment, which may have nothing to do with
the actual long-term worth of an item being traded. And it certainly has
nothing to do with how much you really, really want the trade to work out.
One of the biggest enemies of good traders is overconfidence. Especially
after a nice run of winning trades, a trader can get caught up in the euphoria
and believe that he finally has the secret to successful trading under control.
While he’s checking the real estate listings for that beachfront estate in Maui,
BAM! The next trade is a disaster. Does that mean that the trader is a disaster,
too? No, it just means that the markets won this time around.
Most day traders work in zero-sum markets, where for every winner, there’s
a loser. Hence, not everyone can make money every day. The challenge is to
maintain an even keel so as not to be distracted by confidence when the
trading is going well or by fear when the trading is going poorly. The next
trade is a new trade.
If you don’t know who you are, Wall Street
is an expensive place to find out
The best traders know their limits. They know what gets them excited, what
gets them angry, and what they need to watch out for. They haven’t necessarily
figured it out in front of a screen, either. Instead, they’ve looked back on their
lives and realized how to apply their strengths and weaknesses to trading.
If you are new to trading, consider your own capabilities when designing a
trading plan and think carefully about the things that are likely to trip you up.
By thinking about those things, you can pay attention and act accordingly.
If you wait to trade with real money to find out your tolerances for risk and
stress, you’re going to lose a lot of real money first.

▶ Deriving profits from derivatives
S
o what are you going to trade? Stocks, corn, or bitcoins? You have myriad
choices, but you have to choose so that you can learn the market, know
what changes to expect, and make your trades accordingly. And to avoid the
devilment of the wash-sale rule, which can limit the tax deductibility of short-
term losses (and which you can read about in Chapter 15), you probably want
to make your universe of trading assets to be as broad as possible.
Still, you can’t trade everything. A day has only so many hours, and your
head can hold only so many ideas at any one time. Furthermore, some trad-
ing strategies lend themselves better to certain types of assets than others
(see Chapter 8). By finding out more about all the various investment assets
available to a day trader, you can make better decisions about what you want
to trade and how you want to trade it.
Defining a Good Day-Trading Asset
In academic terms, the universe of investable assets includes just about
anything you can buy at one price and sell at another, potentially higher
price. Artwork and collectibles, real estate, and private companies, for
example, are all considered to be investable assets.

Part I: Getting Started with Day Trading
Day traders have a much smaller group of assets to work with. Expecting a
quick, one-day profit on price changes in real estate isn’t realistic. Online auc-
tions for collectible items take place over days, not minutes. If you’re going
to day trade, you want to find assets that trade easily, several times a day, in
recognized markets. In other words, you want liquidity. As an individual trad-
ing your own account, you want assets that you can purchase with relatively
low capital commitments. And finally, you may want to use leverage —
borrowed money — to improve your return, so you want to look for assets
that can be purchased using other people’s money. The following sections
outline the characteristics of good assets for day trading.
Looking for liquidity
Liquidity is the ability to buy or sell an asset in large quantity without affect-
ing the price levels. Day traders look for liquid assets so they can move in and
out of the market quickly without disrupting price levels. Otherwise, they
may not be able to buy at a good price or sell when they want.
At the most basic level, financial markets are driven by supply and demand.
The more of an asset supplied in the market, the lower the price; the more
of an asset that people demand, the higher the price. In a perfect market, the
amount of supply and demand is matched so that prices don’t change. This
situation occurs if a high volume of people are trading such that the supply
and demand are constantly matched or if the frequency of trades is very low,
which keeps the price from changing.
You may be thinking, wait, don’t I want big price changes so that I can make
money quickly? Yes, you want price changes in the market, but you don’t
want to be the one causing them. The less liquid a market is, the more likely
your buying and selling are to affect market prices, and the smaller your
profit will be.
Volume
Volume is the total amount of a security that trades in a given time period.
The greater the volume, the more buyers and sellers are interested in the
security and the more easily you can get in there and buy and sell without
affecting the price.
Day traders also look at the relationship between volume and price. This
important technical indicator is discussed in more detail in Chapter 7.
Here’s the simple analysis:

==================================================

47
Chapter 3: Deciding What to Trade and How to Trade It
✓ High volume with no change in price levels means an equal match
between buyers and sellers.
✓ High volume with rising prices means that buyers outnumber sellers, so
the price will continue going up.
✓ High volume with falling prices means that sellers outnumber buyers, so
the price will keep going down.
Frequency
Another measure of liquidity is frequency, or how often a security trades. Some
assets, like stock market futures, trade constantly, from the moment the market
opens until the very last trade of the day, and then continue into overnight
trading. Others, like agricultural commodities, trade only during market hours
or only during certain times of the year. Other securities, like stocks, trade
frequently, but the volume rises and falls at regular intervals related to such
things as options expiration (the date at which options on the stock expire).
Much of the market is dominated by high-frequency traders, which are pro-
prietary computerized systems that enter, execute, or cancel buy and sell
orders in the blink of an eye — or less. These traders have thrown a wrench
into a few trading days, but they are only partially responsible for the type of
frequency being discussed here. That’s because high-frequency traders look
for securities that already trade frequently to make the programs work better.

Homing in on high volatility
The volatility of a security is how much the price of an asset varies over a
period of time. It tells you how much prices fluctuate and thus how likely
you are to be able to take advantage of that. For example, if a security has an
average price of $5 but trades anywhere between $1 and $14, it is more
volatile than one with an average price of $5 that trades between $4 and $6.
One standard measure of volatility and risk is standard deviation, which is
how much any given price quote varies from a security’s average price. If you
are dying to see it, the math is explained in the sidebar “Finding the standard
deviation — the hard way,” but you can calculate it with most spreadsheet
programs and many trading platforms.
The higher the standard deviation, the higher the volatility; the higher the vola-
tility, the more a security’s price is going to fluctuate, and the more profit —
and loss — opportunities there are for a day trader.
Standard deviation is also a measure of risk that can be used to evaluate your
trading performance. That use of the measure is discussed in Chapter 16.
Staying within your budget
You don’t necessarily need a lot of money to begin day trading, but you do
need a lot of money to buy certain securities. Stocks generally trade in round
lots, which are orders of at least 100 shares. If you want to buy a stock worth
$40 per share, you need $4,000 in your account. Your broker will probably let
you borrow half of that money, but you still need to come up with the other
$2,000.
Options and futures trade by contract; one contract represents some unit of
the underlying security. For example, in the options market, one contract is
good for 100 shares of the stock. These contracts also trade in round lots of
100 contracts per order.
No one will stop you from buying a smaller amount than the usual round lot in
any given security, but you’ll probably pay a high commission and get worse
execution for your order. Because the returns on each trade tend to be small
anyway, don’t take up day trading until you have enough money to trade your
target asset effectively. Otherwise, you’ll pay too much to your broker without
getting much for yourself.
Bonds do not trade in fractional amounts; they trade on a per-bond basis,
and each bond has a face value of $1,000. Some trade for more or less than
that, depending on how the bond’s interest rate differs from the market rate

Chapter 3: Deciding What to Trade and How to Trade It
of interest, but the $1,000 figure is a good number to keep in mind when
thinking about capital requirements. Many dealers have a minimum order of
ten bonds, though, so a minimum order would be $10,000.
Making sure you can use margin
Most day traders make money through a large volume of small profits. One
way to increase the profit per trade is to use borrowed money to buy more
shares, more contracts, or more bonds. Margin is money in your account
that you borrow against, and almost all brokers will be happy to arrange a
margin loan for you, especially if you’re going to use the money to make more
trades and generate more commissions for the brokerage firm. In Chapter 9, I
discuss how margin is used within an investment strategy. Here, though, you
want to think about how margin affects your choice of assets for day trading.
The following section gives you more information on how margin works and
what you need to consider when selecting assets to trade, but here’s what
you need to know now: Most stocks and bonds are marginable (able to be
purchased on margin), and the Federal Reserve Board allows traders to
borrow up to 50 percent of their value. But not all securities are marginable.
Stocks priced below $3 per share, those traded on the OTC Bulletin Board or
OTC Link (discussed later in this chapter), and those in newly public
companies often cannot be borrowed against or purchased on margin. Your
brokerage firm should have a list of securities that are not eligible for margin.
If leverage is going to be part of your day-trading strategy, be sure that the
assets you plan to trade are marginable.
Generally, your stock or bond account must hold the greater of $2,000 or
50 percent of the purchase price of securities when you borrow the money.
So, for example, if you want to buy $5,000 worth of something on margin,
you need to have $2,500 in your account. The price of those securities can
go down, but if they go down so much that the account now holds only 25
percent of the value of the loan, you’ll get a margin call. That means that you
have to add cash or securities to your account right then and there. If not,
your position will be liquidated.
Excess margin is the amount of money in your account over and above the
minimum. For example, if you have $100,000 in your account and need 30
percent as maintenance margin, then you can borrow against an additional
$70,000, the amount in excess of the 30 percent used for maintenance.
For derivatives, the margin rules are a bit different. Each contract has its own
requirement for the initial margin and maintenance levels that must be kept
on account; in the argot of the derivatives markets, margin is also known as

a performance bond. If you are trading the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s
E-mini MSCI Emerging Markets index contracts, for example, your initial
margin per contract is $10,000, and your maintenance margin is $8,000. You
can find current margin requirements for Chicago Mercantile Exchange and
Chicago Board of Trade products at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s
website, www.cmegroup.com.
Margin requirements aren’t set by the brokerage firms. Instead, the minimum
amount in your account — and thus the maximum amount you can borrow —
is set by the Federal Reserve Board under Regulation T. That’s because of
concerns that if too much borrowing takes place, the borrowers will panic in
a financial downturn and drag the market down even further. (Excessive trad-
ing on margin was a contributing factor to the stock market crash of 1929, in
which the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 13 percent in one day, and the
market did not fully recover until 1954. The financial crisis of 2008 wasn’t
caused by leverage in the stock market but by excessive borrowing in the
real estate market.)
Changing margin rules for pattern day traders
FINRA, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority that oversees the activi-
ties of member brokerage firms (which pretty much includes every brokerage
firm in the United States), has rules about margin for day trading accounts to
help brokerage firms manage their risks while accommodating the needs of
active customers. Their rules complement those of the Federal Reserve Bank.
The FINRA regulations include a category of brokerage customer known as
the pattern day trader. These are folks who day trade, which FINRA defines
as buying, selling or selling short, and then buying the same security on the
same day four or more times in five business days. Furthermore, pattern
day traders, according to FINRA, make enough day trades that they consti-
tute more than 6 percent of their total trading activity for that same five-day
period. Brokerage firms can classify customers as pattern day traders before
they make a single trade. For example, if the firm offers you special training
or services designed for active traders, it may put you into that category.
Pattern day traders have to meet a different margin requirement. They need
to start the trading day with at least $25,000 in cash and securities and main-
tain that amount throughout the trading day. The reason for these require-
ments is that margin requirements for other customers are based on the
value of the account at the end of the day, but most day traders close out
their positions overnight, which means that firms weren’t managing their
intra-day risk. Having the minimums in place helps protect the broker, but it
also limits how much you can borrow if you have less than $25,000 in your
day-trading account.



==================================================
                     PAGE 67                      
==================================================

51
Chapter 3: Deciding What to Trade and How to Trade It
Being a pattern day trader under FINRA offers some advantages, the great-
est one being that you can borrow more money during the day. Meet the
standards, and you’re allowed to borrow four times your excess margin as
long as you close your trades out at the close of the market or before.
A regular customer can only borrow one times the excess. If you exceed
your margin limit, you have five days to deposit more cash or securities in
your account.
Obeying your brokerage firm’s margin policies
The Fed limits the amount that can be borrowed, and FINRA monitors how
member brokerage firms comply. All brokerage firms have to meet those
rules, but some set stricter limits for their customers.
The brokerage firms also set the interest rates for margin and the require-
ments for customers who want to borrow money to trade. The rates can be
high; in 2013, brokerage firm Charles Schwab charged an annual rate of 8
percent on margin loans between $25,000 and $49,999.
Day traders have to pay margin interest, even though their loans are of
short duration. Because it takes three days for a securities trade to settle,
to the accountants, it looks as though you borrowed the money for three
full days, not three hours. Some brokerage firms charge you interest for the
full three days.
You won’t pay the quoted interest rate each day, however; the quoted rate is
almost always annualized. Divide it by 365 to find the daily rate. If the annual
rate is 8.00 percent, then the daily rate will be 8.00 ÷ 365 = 0.02 percent. Check
with your brokerage firm to find out the specifics of the margin interest calcu-
lation for day traders so that you understand what you’ll be charged before
you start to trade.
Trading Types of Securities
In the financial markets, people buy and sell securities every day, but just
what are they buying or selling? Securities are financial instruments. In the
olden days, they were pieces of paper, but now they are electronic entries
that represent a legal claim on some type of underlying asset. This asset may
be a business, if the security is a stock, or it may be a loan to a government
or a corporation, if the security is a bond. In this section, I cover different
types of securities that day traders are likely to run across and tell you what
you need to jump into the fray.

In practice, asset and security are synonyms, and derivative is considered to be
a type of asset or security. But to be precise, these three are not the same:
✓ An asset is a physical item. Examples include a company, a house, gold
bullion, or a loan.
✓ A security is a contract that gives someone the right of ownership of the
asset, such as a share of stock, a bond, a promissory note.
✓ A derivative is a contract that draws its value from the price of a
security. Examples include options and futures.
Stocks
A stock, also called an equity, is a security that represents a fractional inter-
est in the ownership of a company. Buy one share of Microsoft, and you are
an owner of the company, just as Bill Gates is. He may own a much larger
share of the total business, but you both have a stake in it. Stockholders
elect a board of directors to represent their interests in how the company
is managed. Each share is a vote, so good luck getting Bill Gates kicked off
Microsoft’s board.
A share of stock has limited liability, which means that you can lose all of your
investment but no more than that. If the company files for bankruptcy, the
creditors cannot come after the shareholders for the money that they are owed.
Some companies pay their shareholders a dividend, which is a small cash
payment made out of firm profits. Because day traders hold stock for really
short periods of time, they don’t normally collect dividends.
How U.S. stocks trade
Stocks are priced based on a single share, and most brokerage firms charge
commissions on a per-share basis. Despite this per-share pricing, stocks are
almost always traded in round lots of 100 shares. The supply and demand for
a given stock is driven by the company’s expected performance.
A stock’s price is quoted with a bid and an ask.
✓ The bid is the price that the broker pays to buy the stock from you if you
are selling.
✓ The ask is the price that the broker charges you if you are the one buying.
You can remember the difference between the bid and the ask this way: The
broker buys on the bid. Let alliteration be your friend!

==================================================

53
Chapter 3: Deciding What to Trade and How to Trade It
The difference between the bid and the ask is the spread, and that represents
the dealer’s profit.
Here is an example of a price quote:
MSFT $31.60 $31.61
This quote is for Microsoft (ticker symbol: MSFT). The bid, listed first, is
$31.60, and the ask is $31.61. That’s the smallest spread you’ll ever see! The
spread here is so small because Microsoft is a liquid stock, and no big news
events are going on that may change the balance of buyers and sellers.
The brokerage firm makes money from the commission and from the spread.
Many novice day traders focus on the amount of the commission and forget
that some brokerage firms can execute the order better than others, thus
keeping the spread narrower. You need to consider the total cost of trading
when you design a trading strategy and choose a brokerage firm, and brokers
must disclose data on trade execution quality if you request it.
I tend to use the words broker and dealer interchangeably, but there is a dif-
ference. A broker simply matches buyers and sellers of securities, whereas a
dealer buys and sells securities out of its own account. Almost all brokerage
firms are both brokers and dealers.
Where U.S. stocks trade
U.S. stocks trade mostly on organized exchanges such as the New York Stock
Exchange and NASDAQ, but they trade more and more on electronic communi-
cations networks, some of which are operated by the exchanges themselves.
The old-line exchanges are what you may think about when someone men-
tions stock exchanges: brick-and-mortar buildings with lots of people run-
ning around to execute trades in person. They are still major factors in the
market, but they have competition from electronic communication networks,
which were created with the theory being that more competition would make
markets function even better. It hasn’t quite worked out that way. Spreads
between bid and ask prices have narrowed, but volatility has increased since
they became a factor in the market. On the other hand, volatility creates
opportunity for day traders, so that’s not necessarily a bad thing.
When you place an order with your brokerage firm, the broker’s computer
executes that order wherever it can get the best deal. But is that the best
deal for you or the best deal for the brokerage firm? It’s tough to know the
right answer. In general, firms that do more trading and participate in
several exchanges and electronic communications networks can get you
the best execution. (To find out more about choosing brokerage firms, turn
to Chapter 11.)

Part I: Getting Started with Day Trading
The financial markets are in a state of flux, with a lot of mergers and acquisi-
tions among the exchanges. By the time you read the information here, things
may have changed again, which I think is fascinating. It wasn’t so long ago that
these exchanges were staid organizations run like private clubs.
The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)
The New York Stock Exchange is the most famous of all stock exchanges. Most
of the largest U.S. corporations trade on it, and they pay a fee for that privilege.
To be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, a company generally needs
to have at least 2,200 shareholders excluding insiders, trade at least 100,000
shares a month for the last six months, carry a market capitalization (number
of shares outstanding multiplied by price per share) of at least $100 million,
and post total pre-tax earnings of $10 million over the previous three years.
The New York Stock Exchange is more than 200 years old, but it has been
going through some big corporate changes in order to stay relevant. It’s
a floor-based exchange. The trading area is a big open space in the build-
ing, known as the floor. The floor broker, who works for the member firm,
receives the order electronically and then takes it over to the trading post,
which is the area on the floor where the stock in question trades. At the trad-
ing post, the floor broker executes the order at the best available price.
Although it was once an independent, membership-based organization, the
New York Stock Exchange is now thoroughly modern. In 2007, it merged
with Euronext, a holding company for five different European securities
exchanges. Then NYSE Euronext bought the American Stock Exchange, once
a major competitor to the NYSE, and phased it out. The combined company
offers stock, bond, and derivates trading in person at the remaining physical
exchanges and electronically through Arca, its electronic exchange.
Of course, the percentage of trading that has been done by actual people
standing on the floor of an actual building has fallen steadily over the years.
Most trading is done electronically by small day traders and big institutions
alike, with almost 30 percent of trading executed by computer algorithms.
To give you a clue about the importance of computerized trading, the NYSE
allows brokerage firms to place their servers on the floor of the exchange —
for a fee, of course. For some, the millisecond advantage is worth it.
NASDAQ
NASDAQ used to stand for the National Association of Securities Dealers
Automated Quotation System, but now it’s just a name, not an acronym,
pronounced just like it’s spelled. When NASDAQ was founded, it was an
electronic communication network (more on those shortly) that handled
companies that were too small or too speculative to meet New York Stock

Exchange listing requirements. What happened was that brokers liked
using the NASDAQ network, and technology companies on the exchange
(Microsoft, Intel, Apple) that were once small and speculative became
huge international behemoths.
When a customer places an order, the brokerage firm’s computer looks to
see whether a matching order is on the network. Sometimes, the order
can be executed electronically; in other cases, the brokerage firm’s trader
needs to call other traders at other firms to see whether the price is still
good. A key feature of NASDAQ is its market makers, who are employees
of member brokerage firms who agree to buy and sell minimum levels
of specific stocks in order to ensure that some basic level of trading is
taking place.
NASDAQ divides its listed companies into three categories:
✓ The NASDAQ Global Select Market includes the 1,000 largest compa-
nies on the exchange. Companies that make the list have a minimum
average market capitalization of $550 million and total earnings of at
least $11 million in the prior three fiscal years.
✓ The NASDAQ Global Market includes companies that are too small
for the Global Select Market but that aren’t exactly small. To make the
Global Market, companies generally need to have a market capitalization
of at least $75 million, at least 1.1 million shares outstanding, at least 400
shareholders, and a minimum price per share of $4.
✓ The NASDAQ Capital Market is for companies that do not qualify for
the NASDAQ Global Market. To qualify here, companies need a market
capitalization of at least $50 million, at least 1 million shares outstand-
ing, about 300 shareholders, and a minimum price per share of $4.
As a day trader, you’ll find that NASDAQ Global Select Market companies are
the most liquid. You may also notice changes in trading patterns when a com-
pany is close to being moved between categories. An upgrade is a sign of good
news to come and increased market interest. A downgrade means that the
company most likely isn’t doing well and will be of less interest to investors.
The new electronic exchanges
NASDAQ was the first electronic stock exchange, but it’s now an institu-
tion. Several new exchanges have emerged to compete with the NYSE and
NASDAQ. These firms usually started at electronic communications networks
but grew enough to become something else. They have created new trading
opportunities and reduced costs, but they have also added to the volatility
in the market. The following sections discuss the two electronic exchanges in
the stock market now.

BATS Exchange
BATS (www.batstrading.com) stands for Better Alternative Trading
System. It was founded to improve trade execution times, and it is now the
third-largest exchange in the U.S. Several exchange-traded funds are listed
directly on BATS. The exchange had tried to offer stock listings, too, begin-
ning with its own IPO, but a trading system failure stopped the IPO and
scaled back those ambitions — at least for now.
National Stock Exchange
The National Stock Exchange has its roots in the Cincinnati Stock Exchange,
which was founded in 1885. It converted to all-electronic in 1980 and is now
owned by the Chicago Board Options Exchange and a group of brokerage
firms. It is an electronic communications network that trades all exchange-
listed equities, but it does not list securities on its own.
The high-risk over-the-counter exchanges
When the traditional floor-based exchanges were the primary game, a few
companies emerged to trade stocks that were not eligible for exchange
listing. These businesses are still around, and many traders like them
because they can find stocks that have good volatility that are too small to
attract the attention of the big guys with their big computers. However, the
risk level is a lot higher: Some of these stocks don’t trade enough for a day
trader, and a few of these stocks are not issued by legitimate companies.
Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (OTC BB)
The Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board is the market for companies that are
reporting their financials to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
but that don’t qualify for listing in any NASDAQ category. It also includes
some foreign issuers that have not received listing in a U.S. market. American
Bulletin Board companies have four-letter ticker symbols followed by .OB.
For example, Sanborn Resources ticker symbol is SANB.OB. Foreign issu-
ers trade with five-letter symbols, four letters followed by an F. ACS Motion
Control, based in Israel, trades as ACSEF.
Brokerage firms carry quotations on OTC BB stocks through their NASDAQ
workstations or other quotation services, enabling them to find current
prices and locate buyers and sellers for any orders that they have. Quotes
are also posted on the OTC BB website, www.otcbb.com.
In many cases, OTC BB companies are those that used to be on NASDAQ, but
the stock prices have lost too much of their value to maintain their listing. A
Bulletin Board listing is often a last hurrah before oblivion.

Chapter 3: Deciding What to Trade and How to Trade It
OTC Link
Once upon a time, few electronic networks existed, and they didn’t have
enough room for many companies to trade on them. Smaller companies did
not trade daily. To find current prices, brokerage firms subscribed to a price
service that sent out a weekly newsletter listing the prices for those compa-
nies. The newsletter was printed on pink paper, so it became known as the
Pink Sheets. In the more modern era, the newsletter has moved online and
changed its name to OTC Link (www.otcmarkets.com).
OTC Link does not have listing requirements for companies. Most of the
companies don’t qualify for listing on the NASDAQ or OTC BB, usually
because they aren’t current on their filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. These companies have four- or five-letter ticker symbols and
are sometimes shown with the suffix .PK after the ticker. Orders for OTC Link
companies are placed through brokerage firms who use the service to find
prices and match buyers and sellers.
Not all OTC Link companies are legitimate. Because of the minimal listing
requirements, it tends to be the hangout for penny stocks (those trading at
less than $1.00 per share), fraudulent companies, and securities that are easily
manipulated by boiler-room operators. It can be a tough crowd, and a lot of
people get burned.
Dark pools
Don’t be put off by the word dark — dark pools, also known as dark liquid-
ity, are good for traders. These exchanges allow people to place buy and sell
orders that will be executed only if someone takes the other side. Of course,
that’s how most markets operate, but dark pools don’t publish the prices or
the sizes of the orders. Traders use them for low-cost execution, not price
discovery. The downside is that price listings carry information about where
the market is headed.
Bonds
A bond is a loan. The bond buyer gives the bond issuer money. The bond issuer
promises to pay interest on a regular basis. The regular coupon payments are
why bonds are often called fixed income investments. Bond issuers repay the
money borrowed — the principal — on a predetermined date, known as the
maturity. Bonds generally have a maturity of more than ten years; shorter-term
bonds are usually referred to as notes, and bonds that mature within a year
of issuance are usually referred to as bills. Most bonds in the United States
are issued by corporations (corporate bonds) or by the Federal government
(Treasury bonds). Some are issued by local governments (municipal bonds).

==================================================

58
Part I: Getting Started with Day Trading
Over the years, enterprising financiers realized that some investors needed
regular payments but others wanted to receive a single sum at a future date.
So they separated the coupons, the interest payments on a bond, from the
principal. The principal payment, known as a zero-coupon bond, is sold to one
investor, while the coupons, called strips, are sold to another investor. The
borrower makes the payments just like with a regular bond. (Regular bonds,
by the way, are sometimes called plain vanilla.)
The borrower who wants to make a series of payments with no lump-sum
principal repayment would issue an amortizing bond to return principal and
interest on a regular basis. If you think about a typical mortgage, the bor-
rower makes a regular payment of both principal and interest. This way, the
amount owed gets smaller over time so that the borrower does not have to
come up with a large principal repayment at maturity.
Other borrowers prefer to make a single payment at maturity, so they issue
discount bonds. The purchase price is the principal reduced by the amount
of interest that otherwise would be paid.
If a company goes bankrupt, the bondholders get paid before the shareholders
do. In some bankruptcies, the bondholders take over the business, leaving the
current shareholders with nothing.
How bonds trade
Bonds often trade as single bonds, with a face value of $1,000, although some
brokers take on only minimum orders of ten bonds. Bonds do not trade as
frequently as stocks do because most bond investors are looking for steady
income, so they hold their bonds until maturity. Bonds have less risk than
stocks, so they show less price volatility. The value of a bond is mostly deter-
mined by the level of interest rates in the economy. As rates go up, bond
prices go down; when rates go down, bond prices go up. Bond prices are also
affected by how likely the loan is to be repaid. If traders don’t think that the
bond issuer will pay up, then the bond price will fall.
Generally speaking, only corporate and municipal bonds have repayment risk.
The U.S. government could default, but that scenario is unlikely as long as the
government can print money. Most international government bonds have simi-
larly low default risk, but some countries have defaulted. The most notable
was Russia, which refused to print money to repay its debts in the summer of
1998 — a decision that caused huge turmoil in the world’s financial markets,
including the collapse of a major hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management.
Investment banks and the federal government sell new bonds directly to
investors. After they are issued, bonds are said to trade in the secondary
market; some are listed, and some trade over-the-counter, meaning dealers
trade them among themselves rather than over an organized exchange.

Chapter 3: Deciding What to Trade and How to Trade It
A bond price quote looks like this:
0.125 July 14 n 99:98 99:99
Translation: This bond is a U.S. Treasury note maturing in July 2014 and car-
rying an interest rate of 0.125 percent. Similar to stocks, the numbers right
after the n (for note) list the bid and ask. The first number is the bid, the price
that the dealer pays to buy the bond from you if you are selling. The second
number is the ask, the price that the dealer charges you if you’re buying. The
difference is the spread, and that’s the dealer’s profit.
Most bonds are not suitable for day traders. Only Treasury bonds, issued by
the U.S. government, have enough consistent trading volume to attract a day
trader. Because of the capital required to trade and the relatively low liquidity
of many types of bonds, many traders prefer to use futures to bet on interest
rates. I discuss futures in detail later in this chapter.
If you’re one of those day traders who wants to buy or sell bonds anyway or
if you just want to know more about the market, then read on.
Listed bonds
Some larger corporate bonds are traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
Those wanting to buy or sell them place an order through their brokerage
firm, which sends an order to the floor broker. The process is almost
identical to the trading of listed stocks.
Over-the-counter trading
Most corporate and municipal bonds trade over-the-counter, meaning no
organized exchange exists. Instead, brokerage firms use electronic price
services to find out where the buyers and sellers are for different issues.
Over-the-counter bonds don’t trade much. Buyers often give their quality,
interest rate, and maturity requirements to their broker, and the broker waits
until a suitable bond comes to market.
Treasury dealers
Unlike the corporate and municipal bond market, the Treasury market is one
of the most liquid in the world. The best way to buy a new Treasury bond is
directly from the government because no commission is involved. You can
get more information from the Treasury Department’s website, www.
treasurydirect.gov; it has information on all kinds of government bonds
for all kinds of purchasers.
After the bonds are issued, they trade on a secondary market of Treasury
dealers. These are large brokerage firms registered with the government who
agree to buy and sell bonds and maintain a stable market for the bonds.

Part I: Getting Started with Day Trading
If your brokerage firm is not a Treasury dealer, it has a relationship with one
that it can send your order to.
Treasury dealers do quite a bit of day trading in Treasury bonds for the firm’s
own account. After all, the market is liquid enough that day trading is pos-
sible. Few individual day traders work the Treasury market, though, because
it requires a great deal of capital and leverage to make a high return.
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)
Exchange-traded funds (or ETFs) are a cross between mutual funds and
stocks, and they offer a great way for day traders to get exposure to market
segments that may otherwise be difficult to trade. The category is sometimes
called exchange-traded products because some of the funds are structured
more as a trading strategy than as mutual funds. A money-management firm
buys a group of assets — stocks, bonds, or others — and then lists shares
that trade on the market. In most cases, the purchased assets are designed
to mimic the performance of an index, and investors know what those assets
are before they purchase shares in the fund. The big advantage for day trad-
ers is that an ETF can be bought or sold at any time during the trading day,
long or short, with cash or on margin, through a regular brokerage account.
This flexibility is great for day traders.
Although an ETF looks a little bit like an index mutual fund or a market index
futures contract, it has a very different structure. ETFs have two types of
shares, creation units and retail shares:
✓ Creation units: These shares are held by authorized participants, which
are different trading and brokerage firms that agree to commit cash to
the fund. Creation unit holders can exchange their shares for the actual
securities held in the fund, or they can add the appropriate securities to
the fund in order to make new creation units. They do this to keep the
value of the ETF in line with the underlying market index. So if the price
of an ETF falls below the value of the securities in it, the authorized par-
ticipants will trade in their creation units for the securities and then sell
them on the open market. If the price of an ETF rises above the value of
the securities, then the authorized participants will buy up the securi-
ties and exchange them for more creation units that they can sell at a
nice profit.
✓ Retail shares: These ETF shares are listed on the exchange to be bought
and sold by regular investors and traders. If you day trade ETFs, you’ll
be working with the retail shares.

==================================================

61
Chapter 3: Deciding What to Trade and How to Trade It
Most of the time, the price of both the creation units and the retail shares are
right in line with the price of the securities. On occasion, though, the value
of the ETF and its investments will diverge. For example, on May 6, 2010, the
U.S. stock market had a major break. Late in the trading day, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average fell almost 1,000 points and then recovered almost right
away. The cause was a single large sale of futures contracts, but it did a lot of
disruption. Stock prices fell and then rebounded so quickly that ETF pricing
couldn’t keep up. ETF traders had a difficult time determining when to buy
and when to sell because fund valuations were just wrong. It added more
uncertainty to an already rough afternoon.
Traditional ETFs are available on the big market indexes, like the Standard &
Poor’s 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. They are also available in
a variety of domestic bond indexes, international stock indexes, foreign cur-
rencies, and commodities. Because traders are often interested in a market
segment that doesn’t have an index on it, some ETF companies develop their
own niche indexes and issue ETFs based on them. Hence, you can find ETFs
for such markets as green energy and Islamic investing. The liquidity in the
securities in the underlying index may be low, though, so these funds may be
more volatile in trading — and may even have arbitrage opportunities.
Strategy ETFs are funds that are based on an investing strategy rather than
an underlying index. They can be dangerous for long-term investors who
do not know what they are buying, but hey, this book is for traders! Traders
often find great opportunities in strategy ETFs. For example, an inverse ETF is
designed to move the opposite of the underlying index, and a leveraged ETF
is designed to move in greater magnitude than the index. They give you
a bigger toolbox to use to take on the markets.
You can learn more about the thousands of different ETFs on the market at
www.morningstar.com/Cover/ETFs.aspx.
How U.S. exchange-traded funds trade
For day traders, the advantage of exchange traded funds is that they can be
bought and sold just like stocks, discussed earlier in this chapter. Customers
place orders, usually in round lots, through their brokerage firms. The price
quotes come in decimals and include a spread for the dealer.
Where U.S. exchange-traded funds trade
The firm that sets up the exchange-traded fund gets to choose the market
where it trades, as long as the fund meets the exchange’s requirements for
size, liquidity, and financial reporting. Exchange-traded funds trade anywhere
that listed stocks trade.

Cashing In with Currency,
the Big Kahuna
Cash is king, as they say. It’s money that’s readily available in your day-trading
account to buy more securities. For the most part, the interest rate on cash
is very low, but if you close out your positions every night, you’ll always have
a cash balance in your brokerage account. The firm will probably pay you a
little interest on it, so it will contribute to your total return, but not by much.
But one type of cash investment can be really exciting for a day trader, and
that’s currency. Every day, trillions (yes, that’s trillions with a t) of dollars of cur-
rency are exchanged between governments, banks, travelers, businesses, and
speculators. With every trade and every blip in exchange rates, you have new
opportunities to make money. Currency is a bigger, more liquid market than
the U.S. stock and bond markets combined. It’s often referred to as the forex
market, short for foreign exchange. Foreign currency may be an attractive place
to store some of your trading cash, and it can be a great asset to day trade.
Here’s another neat thing about the currency market: Some types of currency
trades are tax free. (Taxes are covered in more detail in Chapter 15.) These
trades are usually longer-term, involving the currency itself, not day trades
and not trades in the futures or forward market. But still — tax free! In other
words, don’t get suckered by ads for currency trading firms that promise
tax-free income until you read the fine print.
How currency trades
The exchange rate is the price of money. It tells you how many dollars it
takes to buy yen, pounds, or euros. The price that people are willing to pay
for a currency depends on the investment opportunities, business opportuni-
ties, and perceived safety in each nation. If American businesses see great
opportunities in Thailand, for example, they have to trade their dollars for
baht in order to pay rent, buy supplies, and hire workers there. This situation
increases the demand for baht relative to the dollar and causes the baht to
go up in price relative to the dollar.
Exchange rates are quoted on a bid-ask basis, just as bonds and stocks are.
A quote may look like this:
USDJPY=X 97.3150 97.5250
This is the exchange rate for converting the U.S. dollar into Japanese yen.
The bid price of 97.3150 is the amount of yen that a dealer would give you



==================================================

==================================================

63
Chapter 3: Deciding What to Trade and How to Trade It
if you wanted to sell a dollar and buy yen. The ask price of 97.5250 is the
amount of yen the dealer would charge you if you wanted to buy a dollar and
sell yen. The difference is the dealer’s profit, and naturally, you’ll be charged
a commission, too.
Note that with currency, you’re a buyer and a seller at the same time, which
can increase the profit opportunities, but it can also increase your risk.
Day traders can trade currencies directly at current exchange rates, which
is known as trading in the spot market. When you exchange money to go
on vacation in a foreign land, you are exchanging on the spot, and you are
allowed to do it as a trader or as an investor. Day traders can also use cur-
rency exchange-traded funds (discussed earlier in this chapter) or currency
futures (discussed later in this chapter) to profit from the changing prices
of money.
Where currency trades
Spot currency — the real-time value of money — does not trade on an orga-
nized exchange. Instead, banks, brokerage firms, hedge funds, and currency
dealers buy and sell amongst themselves all day, every day.
Day traders can open dedicated forex accounts through their brokers or
currency dealers and then trade as they see opportunities during the day.
If you are interested in trading currencies, be sure to check out the fees
involved. Some banks and brokerages are really set up to do forex trades for
businesses and travelers, so the fees will be too high for you to have a decent
profit potential. You can learn more about different types of accounts that
day traders may have in Chapter 11.
Considering Commodities
and How They Trade
Commodities are basic, interchangeable goods sold in bulk and used to make
other goods. Examples include oil, gold, wheat, and lumber. Commodities
are popular with investors as a hedge against inflation and uncertainty. Stock
prices can go to zero, but people still need to eat! While commodity prices
usually tend to increase at the same rate as in the overall economy, meaning
they maintain their real (inflation-adjusted) value, they can also be suscep-
tible to short-term changes in supply and demand. A cold winter increases

demand for oil, a dry summer reduces production of wheat, and a civil war
could disrupt access to platinum mines.
Day traders aren’t going to buy commodities outright. If you really want to
haul bushels of grain around all day, you can do that without taking on the
risks of day trading (you’d get more exercise, too). Instead, day traders who
want to play with commodities can look to other investments. The most
popular way is to buy futures contracts, which change in price with the
underlying commodity (discussed later in this chapter). Increasingly, many
people trade commodities through exchange-traded funds that are based on
the value of an underlying basket of commodities.
Commodity prices affect the broad economy, not just the prices of commodi-
ties contracts on the futures exchanges. If you day trade stocks in particular,
you may find that changes in the price of oil or agricultural commodities affect
many of the companies that you are involved with as well as the broader stock
market indexes.
Dealing in Derivatives
Derivatives are financial contracts that draw their value from the value of an
underlying asset, security, or index. For example, an S&P 500 futures contract
gives the buyer a cash payment based on the price of the S&P 500 index
on the day that the contract expires. The contract’s value thus depends on
where the index is trading. You’re not trading the index itself; instead, you’re
trading a contract with a value derived from the price of the index. The index
value changes all the time, so day traders have lots of opportunities to buy
and sell.
Many day traders choose derivatives because these products give traders
access to much of the economic universe, including stocks, bonds, commodi-
ties, and currencies. Furthermore, derivatives may have more favorable tax
treatment for day traders than many other assets; more than one new day
trader playing the stock market has been burned by the so-called wash-sale
rule, which limits the deductibility of short-term losses. (I discuss this rule
in Chapter 15.) Futures aren’t subject to wash-sale rules. Read on to find out
more and see if they are right for you!
Getting to know types of derivatives
Day traders are likely to come across three types of derivatives: options,
futures, and warrants. Options and futures trade on dedicated derivatives
exchanges, whereas warrants trade on stock exchanges.

Options
An option is a contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation,
to buy or sell the underlying asset at an agreed-upon price at an agreed-upon
date in the future. An option that gives you the right to buy is a call, and one
that gives you the right to sell is a put. A call is most valuable if the stock price
is going up, whereas a put has more value if the stock price is going down.
Here’s one way to remember the difference: You call up your friend to put
down your enemy.
For example, a MSFT 2013 Aug 26.00 call gives you the right to buy Microsoft
at $26.00 per share at the expiration date on the third Friday in August 2013.
(Did you know that traders refer to Microsoft as “Mr. Softy”? Clever, huh?) If
Microsoft is trading above $26.00, you can exercise the option and make a
quick profit. If it is selling below $26.00, you could by the stock cheaper in
the open market, so the option would be worthless.
You can find great information on options, including online tutorials, at the
Chicago Board Options Exchange website, www.cboe.com.
Futures
A futures contract gives you the obligation to buy a set quantity of the under-
lying asset at a set price and a set future date. Futures started in the agricul-
tural industry because they allowed farmers and food processors to lock in
their prices early in the growing season, reducing the amount of uncertainty
in their businesses. Futures have now been applied to many different assets,
ranging from pork bellies (which really do trade — they are used to make
bacon) to currency values. A simple example is a lock in a home mortgage
rate; the borrower knows the rate that will be applied before the sale is
closed and the loan is finalized. Day traders use futures to trade commodities
without having to handle the actual assets.

Part I: Getting Started with Day Trading
Most futures contracts are closed out with cash before the settlement
date. Financial contracts — futures on currencies, interest rates, or market
index values — can only be closed out with cash. Commodity contracts
may be settled with the physical items, but almost all are settled with
cash. No one hauls a side of beef onto the floor of the Chicago Board of
Trade!
Warrants
A warrant is similar to an option, but it’s issued by the company rather than
sold on an organized exchange. (After they are issued, warrants trade simi-
larly to stocks.) A warrant gives the holder the right to buy more stock in the
company at an agreed-upon price in the future.
A cousin of the warrant is the convertible bond, which is debt issued by the
company. The company pays interest on the bond, and the bondholder has
the right to exchange it for stock, depending on where interest rates and the
stock price are. Convertibles trade on the stock exchanges.
Buying and selling derivatives
Derivatives trade a little differently than other types of securities because
they are based on promises. When someone buys an option on a stock,
they aren’t trading the stock with someone right now; they’re buying the
right to buy or sell it in the future. That means that the option buyer needs
to know that the person on the other side is going to pay up. Because of
that, the derivatives exchanges have systems in place to make sure that
those who buy and sell the contracts will be able to perform when they
have to. Requirements for trading derivatives are different than in other
markets.
How derivatives trade
I talk about marginability earlier in this chapter, but the word margin is used
differently when discussing derivatives, in part because derivatives are
already leveraged. You aren’t buying the asset, just exposure to the price
change, so you can get a lot of bang for your buck. (The risks and rewards of
leverage are covered in detail in Chapter 9.)
Margin in the derivatives market is the money you have to put up to ensure
that you’ll perform on the contract when it comes time to execute it. In the
stock market, margin is collateral against a loan from the brokerage firm. In
the derivatives markets, margin is collateral against the amount you may
have to pay up on the contract. The more likely it is that you will have to pay

Chapter 3: Deciding What to Trade and How to Trade It
the party who bought or sold the contract, the more margin money you have
to put up. Some exchanges prefer to use the term performance bond instead
of margin.
To buy a derivative, you put up the margin with the exchange’s clearing
house. That way, the exchange knows that you have the money to make good
on your side of the deal — if, say, a call option that you sell is executed or
you lose money on a currency forward that you buy. Your brokerage firm
arranges for the deposit.
At the end of each day, derivatives contracts are marked-to-market, meaning
that they are revalued. Profits are credited to the trader’s margin account,
and losses are deducted. If the margin falls below the necessary amount, the
trader gets a call and has to deposit more money.
By definition, day traders close out at the end of every day, so their options
are not marked-to-market. The contracts are someone else’s problem, and the
profits or losses on the trade go straight to the margin account, ready for the
next day’s trading.
Where derivatives trade
In the olden days, derivative trading involved open outcry on physical
exchanges. Traders on the floor received orders and executed them among
themselves, shouting and using hand signals to indicate what they wanted
to do. As I write this, vestiges of floor trading remain on some derivatives
exchanges, but there are fewer and fewer of them.
Almost all traders work “upstairs,” as they say on the exchanges, trading
electronically. Some are employees of large commodities brokerage firms,
and others are independent. Employed and independent traders alike may
work by executing someone else’s orders for a fee, or they may work for
proprietary accounts.
All the derivatives exchanges offer electronic trading services, even if they
still have trading floors. As electronic trading has become more popular, it
has chased many experienced floor traders into retirement because they
can’t all make the transition, and it has caused much restructuring and
consolidation among the exchanges.
Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE)
The Chicago Board Options Exchange, often known by the acronym CBOE
(pronounced see-bo), is the largest options market in the United States.
This is where orders for stock options are traded. Brokerage firms use floor
brokers in the trading pits or the CBOE’s electronic trading system to handle
customer orders. You can find out more at its website, www.cboe.com.

The CME Group
The CME Group (www.cmegroup.com) is made up of the Chicago Board of
Trade (CBOT), the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME, also called the Merc),
and the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). The three exchanges
merged in 2008, although people often refer to each by its former name.
Historically, the Board of Trade specialized in such agricultural commodities
as corn, wheat, rice, oats, and soybeans, while the Merc offered contracts
in non-grain agricultural products (like milk, butter, cattle, pork bellies, and
fertilizer) and in foreign exchange, interest rates, and Standard & Poor’s
and NASDAQ indexes. Fuels and metals traded at the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
The combined CME Group offers a suite of products, known as their E-mini
contracts, for smaller traders. These products allow day traders to play in
different agricultural and financial markets without as much margin as would
be required for full-sized CME contracts. The E-minis are all traded electroni-
cally, too. Currently, E-minis are available on wheat, corn, and soybeans, as
well as on stock market indexes in the United States and overseas.
Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)
The Intercontinental Exchange (www.theice.com) is a relatively new com-
pany that has acquired commodity and futures exchanges in North America
and Europe. In 2008, it acquired the New York Board of Trade, which offers a
range of agricultural and financial contracts, especially on coffee, cotton, and
currency exchange rates. Orders are filled in the trading pits or through an
electronic trading system. Although the ICE doesn’t have contracts designed
specifically for smaller traders, many day traders who like commodities and
who have enough capital to manage the margin trade there.
International Securities Exchange (ISE)
The International Securities Exchange (www.ise.com) is the U.S. subsidiary
of Eurex, a German derivatives trading firm. It handles trades in equity and
foreign-exchange options, including a series of mini options for small traders.
These minis are options on only 10 shares of the underlying, as opposed to a
standard option, which is on 100 shares.

Defining Trading: Risk, Reward,
and T iming
In This Chapter
▶ Taking on risk and getting a return
▶ Investing for the long haul versus trading for the day
▶ Keeping the risks in mind
D
ay trading isn’t investing, nor is it gambling — at least not if done right.
But the lines between the three can be thin. By knowing where the lines
are, you’ll be in a better position to follow your trading strategy and make
more money. And if you can avoid the trap of gambling, you’ll be better able
to preserve your trading capital.
The difference between investing and gambling is the risk and return trad-
eoff. In investing, the odds are generally in your favor, but that doesn’t mean
you’re going to make money. In gambling, the odds are against you. And
unlike in the finer establishments in Las Vegas, if you end up gambling as a
day trader, no one is going to bring you free drinks or tickets to some extrava-
gant show to help ease the pain of failing. A lot comes down to personality; if
you’re on a casino’s “do not admit” list, you probably aren’t a great candidate
for day trading.
Day trading is starting to look more like gambling than it has in years past,
because high-frequency traders are taking more of the arbitrage and scalping
opportunities. Be sure you’re comfortable with the risk before you start to
trade.
This chapter starts off with a lot of gory details about risk and return. My
goal is to help you understand how the securities markets price risk and
reward those who are willing to take it. Then I explain the differences in risk
and reward for investors, traders, and gamblers to give you better informa-
tion to help you plan your day trading.

Part I: Getting Started with Day Trading
Understanding Risk and Return
Investors, traders, and gamblers have this in common: They put their money
at risk, and they expect to get a return. Ideally, that return comes in the form
of cold, hard cash, but if they’re not careful, they could get nothing — or
worse, end up owing money. Traders should risk no more than they can
afford to lose.
Trading is a business: The more you know about the potential risks and the
sources of your potential return, the better off you’ll be. Your risk is that you
won’t get the return you expect, and your reward is that you get fair compen-
sation for the risk you take.
What is risk, anyway?
Risk is the measurable likelihood of loss. The riskier something is, the more
frequently a loss will occur, and the larger that loss is likely to be. Playing in
traffic is riskier than driving in traffic, and skydiving is riskier than gardening.
This doesn’t mean that you can’t have losses in a low-risk activity or big
gains in a high-risk one. It just means that with the low-risk game, losses are
less likely to happen, and when they do, they’re likely to be small.
What’s the difference between risk and uncertainty? Risk involves the known
likelihood of something good or bad happening so that it can be priced.
What’s the likelihood of your living to be 100? Or of getting into a car accident
tonight? Your insurance company knows, and it figures your rates accordingly.
What’s the likelihood of aliens from outer space arriving and taking over the
Earth? Who knows! It could happen, but that event is uncertain, not risky — at
least until it happens.
The ability to measure risk makes modern business possible. Until math-
ematicians were able to use statistics to quantify human activities, people
assumed that bad things were simply the result of bad luck or the wrath of
the gods. But when people understand probability, they can apply and use
that to assess the likelihood of an event happening and determine the com-
mensurate compensation for taking the risk. If a sailor agreed to join a voyage
of exploration, what was the probability that he would return home alive?
And what would be fair compensation to him for that risk? What was the
probability of a silo of grain going up in flames? And how much should the
farmer charge the grain buyers for the risk that he was taking, and how much
should someone else charge to insure the farmer against that fire?

==================================================

Chapter 4: Defining Trading: Risk, Reward, and Timing
Considering the probability of a loss
Whenever you take risk, you take on the probability of loss. If you know what
that probability is, you can determine whether the terms you’re being offered
are fair and whether you have a reasonable expectation for the size of the loss.
Say that you’re presented with this opportunity: You put up $10. You have
an 80 percent chance of getting back $11 and a 20 percent chance of losing
everything. Should you take it? To find out, you multiply the expected return
by the likelihood and add them together: (80% × $11) + (20% × $0) = $8.80.
Your expected return of $8.80 is less than the $10 cost of this contract, so you
should pass on it.
Now suppose you’re offered this opportunity: You put up $10. You have a 90
percent chance of getting back $11 and a 10 percent chance of getting back
$6. Your expected return is (90% × $11) + (10% × $6) = $10.50. This contract
would be in your favor, so you should take it.
Here’s a third proposition: You put up $10. You have a 90 percent chance of
getting back $13.89 and a 10 percent chance of losing $20 — even more than
you put up. Your expected return is (90% × 13.89) + (10% × –$20) = $10.50. You
end up with the same expected return as the preceding proposition, but do
you like it as much? Many people would not like that deal because they are
looking at the dollar value of the loss rather than the risk. People who overre-
act to the risk of loss without considering the facts on hand are probably not
going to be good traders.
When thinking about loss, most people tend to put too much weight on the
absolute dollar amount that they can lose, rather than thinking about the like-
lihood of losing it. The problem is that the markets don’t trade on your per-
sonal preferences. This is one of the psychological hurdles of trading that
those who are successful can overcome. Can you? (You can find some tips on
this in Chapter 8.)
Working with limited liability (usually)
Securities markets rely on the concept of limited liability. That is, you cannot
lose any more money than you invested in the first place. If you buy a stock,
that stock can go down to zero, but it can’t go any lower. If the company
goes bankrupt, no one can come to you and ask you to cover the bills. On
the other hand, the stock price can go up infinitely, so the possible return
for your risk is huge. (Microsoft has grown more than 500 fold since it came
public, which isn’t quite infinity, but I sure wish I had taken that proposition.)



==================================================

==================================================

72
Part I: Getting Started with Day Trading
Although most day-trading strategies have the same limited liability — that is,
you can lose what you trade and no more — some strategies have unlimited
liability. If you sell a stock short (borrow shares and then sell them in hopes
that the stock goes down in price, allowing you to repay the loan with cheaper
shares, a strategy discussed in Chapter 9), and if the stock goes up drastically,
you have to repay the loan with those highly valued shares! Most likely, you’re
going to close out your position before that happens, but even if you close out
your positions every night like a good day trader should, some strategies have
the potential to cost you more money than you have in your trading account.
To protect themselves and to protect you against losing more money than you
have, brokerage firms and options exchanges require you to keep enough
funds in your account to cover shortfalls (known as margin, discussed in
Chapter 3). You have to be approved before you can trade in certain securi-
ties. For example, anyone trading options has to fill out an agreement that the
brokerage firm must first approve and then keep on file.
Playing the zero-sum game
Many day trading strategies are zero-sum games, meaning that for every
winner on a trade, there is a loser. It’s especially true in options markets.
Of course, the person on the other side of the trade may not mind being a
loser; she may have entered into a trade to hedge (protect against a decline
in) another investment and is happy to have a small loss instead of a much
larger one.
The problem for you as a day trader is that a zero-sum game has little
wiggle room. Every trade you make is going to win or lose, and your losses
may exactly offset your winners. Beating the odds is even tougher when so
many traders are using computer algorithms. Backtesting and tracking (see
Chapter 16) are important for assessing your changing risk.
Finding the probability of not getting the return you expect
In addition to absolute measures of risk and liability, you also need to con-
sider volatility. That’s how much a security’s price may go up or down in a
given time period.
The math for measuring volatility is based on standard deviation (discussed
in Chapters 3 and 16). A standard deviation calculation starts with the aver-
age return over a given time period. That average is the expected return —
the return that, on average, you’ll get if you stick with your trading strategy.
But any given week, month, or year, the return may be very different from
what you expect. The more likely you are to get what you expect, the less risk
you take in the form of volatility.



==================================================
                     PAGE 89                      
==================================================

73
Chapter 4: Defining Trading: Risk, Reward, and Timing
Standard deviation shows up many times in trading, and you can find a
detailed explanation of it in Chapter 16. The key thing to know is this: The
higher the standard deviation of the underlying securities, the more risk you
take with your trade. However, the same volatility creates trading opportuni-
ties for day traders to exploit. A security with a low standard deviation isn’t
going to offer you many chances to make money over the course of a day.
Standard deviation is used to calculate another statistic: beta. Beta tells you
how risky a security is relative to the risk of the market itself. If you buy a
stock with a beta of more than 1, that stock is expected to go up in price by a
larger percentage than the market when the market is up, and it’s expected to
go down by a larger percentage than the market when the market is down.
High-beta stocks and options on high-beta stocks are riskier than low-beta
stocks, but they offer a greater potential for return.
The word beta comes from the capital assets pricing model, an academic
theory that says that the return on an investment is a function of the risk-free
rate of return (discussed in the next section), the extra risk of investing in the
market as a whole, and then the volatility — beta — of the security relative to
the market. Under the capital assets pricing model, no other sources of risk
and return exist. Any other sources would be called alpha, but in theory, alpha
doesn’t exist. Not everyone agrees with that, but the terms alpha and beta
have stuck.
Getting rewarded for the risk you take
When you take risk, you expect to get a return. That’s fair enough, right? That
return comes in a few different forms related to the risk taken. Although you
may not really care how you get your return as long as you get it, thinking
about the breakdown of returns can help you think about your trading strat-
egy and how it works for you.
Opportunity cost
The opportunity cost of your money is the return you could get doing some-
thing else. Is your choice day trading or staying at your current job? Your
opportunity cost is your current salary and benefits. You’d give up that
money if you quit to day trade. Is the opportunity cost low enough that it’s
worth your while? It may be. Just because taking advantage of an opportunity
carries a cost doesn’t mean that the opportunity isn’t worth it.
When you trade, you want to cover your opportunity cost. Your cost will be
different than someone else’s, but if you know what that cost is up front, you’ll
have a better idea of whether your return is worth your risk.



==================================================
                     PAGE 90                      
==================================================

74
Part I: Getting Started with Day Trading
Here’s another way to think about opportunity cost. When you make one
trade, you give up the opportunity to use that money for another trade. That
means you only want to trade if you know that the trade is going to work
out, more likely than not. That’s why you need to plan your trades (see
Chapter 2) and backtest (run a simulation using your strategy and historic
securities prices) and evaluate your performance (see Chapter 16). By doing
these things, you know that you are trading for the right reasons and not just
out of boredom.
Risk-free rate of return and the time value of money
The value of money changes over time. In most cases, this change is the
result of inflation, which is the general increase in price levels in an economy.
But the value of money also changes because you give up the use of money
for some period of time. That’s why any investment or trading opportunity
should include compensation for the time value of your money.
In day trading, your returns from the time value of money are small, because
you only hold positions for a short period of time and close them out over-
night. Still, there’s some time component to the money you make. That small-
est return is known as the risk-free rate of return. That’s what you demand
for giving up the use of your money, even if you know with certainty that
you’ll get your money back. In practice, investors think of the risk-free rate
of return as the rate on U.S. government treasury bills, which are bonds that
mature in less than one year. This rate is widely quoted in The Wall Street
Journal and electronic price-quote systems.
If you cannot generate a return that’s at least equal to the risk-free rate of
return, you shouldn’t be trading because your return wouldn’t be appropriate
to the risk you’re taking.
Risk-return tradeoff
Economists say that there’s no such thing as a free lunch. Whatever return
you get, you get because you took some risk and gave up another oppor-
tunity for your time and money. In that sense, there’s no secret to making
money. It’s all about work and risk.
This concept is known as the risk-reward tradeoff. The greater the potential
reward, the greater the amount of risk you’re expected to take and thus the
greater potential you have for loss. But if you understand the risks you’re
taking, you may well find that they’re worth it. That’s why you have to think
about the risks and rewards up front.

Chapter 4: Defining Trading: Risk, Reward, and Timing
Market efficiency in the real world
The reason a balance exists between risk and reward is that markets are
reasonably efficient. This efficiency means that prices reflect all known
information about the companies and the economy and that all participants
understand the relative tradeoffs available to them. Otherwise, you’d have
opportunities to make a riskless profit, and that just won’t do, according to
the average economist. “You can’t pluck nickels out of thin air,” they like to
say. In an efficient market, if an opportunity exists to make money without
risk, someone would have taken advantage of it already.
Here’s how market efficiency works: You have information that says that
Company A is going to announce good earnings tomorrow, so you buy the
stock. Your increased demand causes the price to go up, and pretty soon, the
stock price is where it should be, given that the company is doing well. The
information advantage is rapidly eliminated. In most cases, everyone gets the
news — or hears the rumor — of the good earnings at the same time, so the
price adjustment happens quickly.
Wouldn’t it be great to get the news of a good earnings report before everyone
else and make a quick trading profit? Yep. At least until the Feds show up and
haul you off to prison — talk about your opportunity costs. Trading on mate-
rial inside information (information that is not generally known that would
affect the price of the security) is illegal. And yes, the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the exchanges monitor trading to see whether trading pat-
terns suggest illegal trading based on inside information because they want all
investors and traders to feel confident that the investment business is fair. Be
very wary of tips that seem too good to be true.
The markets may be more or less efficient, but that doesn’t mean they work
by magic. Price changes happen because people act on news, and the people
who act the fastest are day traders. In the example, notice that it was the
activity of traders that caused the price of Company A stock to go up to
reflect the expected good earnings report.
In economic terms, arbitrage is a riskless profit. A hard-core believer in
academic theory would say that arbitrage opportunities don’t exist. In prac-
tice, though, they do. Here’s how arbitrage works: Although Company A is
expected to have a good earnings announcement tomorrow, you notice that
the stock price has gone up faster than the price of a call option on Company
A, even though premium should reflect the stock price. So you sell Company
A (borrowing shares and selling it short if you have to) and then use the pro-
ceeds to buy the option. When the option price goes up to reflect the stock
price, you can sell the option (that is, close out your short position) and
lock in a riskless profit — at least, before your trading costs are considered.
Chapter 10 discusses arbitrage in more detail.

After you become wise to the ways of risk “If it were real, someone would have taken it
and return, this joke should make sense already.”

Market efficiency isn’t perfect. It can take a while for people to make a logical
decision about what an asset is worth, and until that happens, trading can
be irrational and inefficient. Whether it’s Japanese stocks, Internet stocks,
condominiums in Florida, or gold, the markets have pockets of craziness that
defy rhyme and reason. In the short term, a wave of panic or euphoria can
overtake the market during a single trading day, pushing prices into ineffi-
cient territory. On days like that, your ability to keep calm and steer into the
trend, rather than getting swept up into an uncontrollable craze, will help you
have more winning trades.
Bubbles and panics happen, and they happen more often than academic econ-
omists like to admit. However, most days, trading is efficient. Your edge comes
from knowing the markets, having good risk management, and being able to
walk away. Don’t count on crazy price action every day.
Differentiating Trading, Investing,
and Gambling
Day trading is a cousin to both investing and gambling, but it is not the same
as either. Day trading involves quick reactions to the markets, not a long-term
consideration of all the factors that can drive an investment. It works with
odds in your favor, or at least that are even, rather than with odds that are
against you.
Still, the three activities overlap. Many day traders also invest, and some
came to trading after years of watching the markets as an investor. In addi-
tion, more than one day trader claims that good poker skills are useful for
understanding market psychology, and many day traders can point to a win-
ning trade that was made for no particular reason at all. To help you keep

Chapter 4: Defining Trading: Risk, Reward, and Timing
straight the differences between day trading, investing, and gambling, this
section explains which is which so that you can better understand what
you’re doing when you day trade. After all, you can increase your chances of
success if you stick to the business at hand.
Investing is slow and steady
Investing is the process of putting money at risk in order to get a return.
It’s the raw material of capitalism. It’s the way that businesses get started,
roads get built, and explorations get financed. It’s how our economy matches
people who have more money than they need, at least during part of their
lives, with people who need it in order to grow society’s capabilities.
Investing is heady stuff. And it’s very much focused on the long term. Good
investors do a lot of research before committing their money because they
know that it will take a long time to see a payoff. That’s okay with them.
Investors often invest in things that are out of favor, because they know that,
with time, others will recognize the value and respond in kind.
One of the best investors of all time is Warren Buffett, chief executive officer of
Berkshire Hathaway. His annual letters to shareholders offer great insight. You
can read them at www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/letters.html.
What’s the difference between investing and saving? When you save, you take
no risk. Your compensation is low; it’s just enough to cover the time value of
money. Generally, the return on savings equals inflation and no more. In fact,
a lot of banks pay a lot less than the inflation rate on a federally insured
savings account, meaning that you’re paying the bank to use your money.
In contrast to investing, day trading moves fast. Day traders react only to
what’s on the screen. There’s no time to do research, and the market is
always right when you’re day trading. You don’t have two months or two
years to wait for the fundamentals to work out and the rest of Wall Street to
see how smart you were. You have today. And if you can’t live with that, you
shouldn’t be day trading.
Trading works fast
Trading is the act of buying and selling securities. All investors trade, because
they need to buy and sell their investments. But to investors, trading is a rare
transaction, and they get more value from finding a good opportunity, buying
it cheap, and selling it at a much higher price sometime in the future. But
traders are not investors.

Part I: Getting Started with Day Trading
Traders look to take advantage of short-term price discrepancies in the
market. In general, they don’t take a lot of risk on each trade, so they don’t
get a lot of return on each trade, either. Traders act quickly. They look at
what the market is telling them and then respond. They know that many of
their trades won’t work out, but as long as more than half work, they’ll be
okay. They don’t do a lot of in-depth research on the securities they trade,
but they know the normal price and volume patterns well enough that they
can recognize potential profit opportunities.
Trading keeps markets efficient because it creates the short-term supply
and demand that eliminates small price discrepancies. It also creates a lot of
stress for traders, who must react in the here and now. Traders give up the
luxury of time in exchange for a quick profit.
Speculation is related to trading in that it often involves short-term transac-
tions. Speculators take risks, assuming a much greater return than may be
expected, and a lot of what-ifs may have to be satisfied for the transaction to
pay off. Many speculators hedge their risks with other securities, such as
options or futures.
Gambling is nothing more than luck
A gambler puts up money in the hopes of a payoff if a random event occurs.
The odds are always against the gambler and in favor of the house, but
people like to gamble because they like to hope that, if they hit it lucky, their
return will be as large as their loss is likely.
Some gamblers believe that the odds can be beaten, but they are wrong.
(Certain card games are more games of skill than gambling, assuming you
can find a casino that plays under standard rules. Yeah, you can count cards
when playing blackjack with your friends, but doing so is a lot harder in a
professionally run casino.) They get excited about the potential for a big win
and get caught up in the glamour of the casino, and soon the odds go to work
and drain away their stakes.
There is such a thing as a fair lottery, which takes place when the expected
payoff is higher than the odds of playing. You won’t find it at most casinos,
although sometimes the odds in a sports book or horse race favor the bettor,
at least in the short term. A more common example takes place in lotteries
when the jackpots roll over to astronomical amounts. For example, in May
2013, the multi-state Powerball lottery had a jackpot of $590 million, but the
odds of winning were 1 in 175 million. This means that a $1.00 ticket had an
expected value of $3.37, making it a fair proposition. (That $590 million was a
record that has not been beaten.)

Chapter 4: Defining Trading: Risk, Reward, and Timing
Trading is not gambling, but traders who are not paying attention to their
strategy and its performance can cross over into gambling. They can view the
blips on their computer screen as a game. They can start making trades with-
out any regard for the risk and return characteristics. They can start believing
that how they do things affects the trade. And pretty soon, they are using the
securities market as a giant casino, using trading techniques that have odds as
bad as any slot machine.
Managing the Risks of Day Trading
When you know more about the risks, returns, and related activities of day
trading, you can think more about how you’re going to run your day-trading
business. Before you flip through the book to find out how to get started,
consider two more kinds of risk that you need to think about:
✓ Business risk
✓ Personal risk
You need to understand and manage both in order to better manage the risks
of the trading day.
It’s your business
Business risk is the uncertainty of the timing of your cash flow. Not every
month of trading is going to be great, but your bills will come due no matter
what. You’ll have to pay for subscriptions while keeping the lights turned on
and the computer connected to the Internet. Taxes come due four times a
year, and keyboards hold a mysterious attraction for carbonated beverages,
causing them to short out at the most inopportune times.
Keep track of your business expenses and keep them as low as is reasonable.
You should invest in your business, obviously, but only to the extent that you
can pay your bills even if you have an off month in the market.
Regardless of what happens to your trading account, you need cash on hand
to pay your bills or you’ll be out of business. The best way to protect yourself
is to start out with a cash cushion just for covering your operating expenses.
Keep this cushion separate from your trading funds. Replenish it during good
months. Walk away from trading if it goes down to zero.

It’s your life
The personal risk of trading is that it becomes an obsession that crowds out
everything else in your life. Trading is a stressful business, and the difference
between those who succeed and those who fail is often psychological. You
need to be on when you are trading and then, at the end of the trading day,
close out the emotions the same way that you close out your positions. It’s
not easy, so you need to have ways to manage your mood. Figure those out
before you start trading, and you’ll be ahead of the game.
In fact, the personal risk is so great that I devote an entire chapter to
managing it — Chapter 14. Go there if anything you have read in this chapter
alarms you.

Regulation and the Modern Trader
In This Chapter
▶ Identifying the regulators
▶ Considering basic brokerage requirements
▶ Avoiding insider trading tips
▶ Protecting the markets in crisis situations
▶ Following procedure when you take on partners
T
he financial markets are wild and woolly playgrounds for capitalism at its
best. Every moment of the trading day, the actions of buyers and sellers
determine what the price of a stock, commodity, or currency should be at
that moment, given the supply, the demand, and the information out there.
It’s beautiful.
One reason the markets work well most of the time is that they are regulated.
That may seem like an oxymoron: Isn’t capitalism all about free trade, unfet-
tered by any rules from nannying bureaucrats? Ah, but for capitalism to work,
people on both sides of a trade need to know that the terms will be enforced.
They need to know that the money in their accounts is there and is safe from
theft. And they need to know that no one has an unfair advantage. Regulation
creates the trust that makes markets function.
As a day trader, you may not be managing money for other investors, and you
may not answer to an employer, but that doesn’t mean you don’t have rules
to follow. Day traders have to comply with applicable securities laws and
exchange regulations, some of which specifically address those who make
lots of short-term trades. Likewise, brokers and advisors who deal with day
traders have regulations that they need to follow. Understanding all these dif-
ferent rules and regulations can help you make better decisions about whom
to deal with. In this chapter, you find out who does the regulating, what they
look at, and how they affect you.

Part I: Getting Started with Day Trading
Looking Back on the Road to Regulations
With the advent of the telegraph, traders were able to receive daily price
quotes. Many cities had bucket shops, storefront businesses where traders
bet on changes in stock and commodity prices. These traders weren’t buying
the security itself, even for a few minutes; instead they were placing bets
against others. These schemes were highly prone to manipulation and fraud,
and they were wiped out after the stock market crash of 1929.
After the 1929 crash, small investors began trading off the ticker tape, which
was a printout of price changes sent by telegraph, or wire. In most cases,
traders made these transactions by going down to their brokerage firm’s
office, sitting in a conference room, and placing orders based on the changes
they saw come across the tape. Really serious traders got wires installed in
their own offices, but the costs were prohibitive for most individual inves-
tors. In any event, traders still had to place their orders through a broker.
Because they didn’t have direct access to the market, they couldn’t count on
timely execution.
Another reason there was so little day trading back then is that all brokerage
firms charged the same commissions until 1975. That year, the Securities and
Exchange Commission ruled that this practice amounted to price fixing. After
this ruling, brokers could compete on their commissions. Some brokerage
firms, such as Charles Schwab, began to allow customers to trade stock at
discount commission rates, which made active trading more profitable. Some
brokerage firms don’t even charge commissions anymore (but don’t worry;
they get money from you in other ways).
The system of trading off the ticker tape more or less persisted until the
stock market crash of 1987. Brokerage firms and market makers were flooded
with orders, so they took care of their biggest customers first and pushed the
smallest trades to the bottom of the pile. After the crash, the exchanges and
the Securities and Exchange Commission called for several changes designed
to reduce the chances of another crash and improve execution if one were
to happen. One of those changes was the Small Order Entry System, often
known as SOES, which gave orders of 1,000 shares or less priority over
larger orders.
Then, in the 1990s, Internet access became widely available, and several elec-
tronic communications networks started giving small traders direct access
to price quotes and trading activities. This meant that traders could place
orders on the same footing as the brokers they once had to work through.
In fact, thanks to the SOES, the small traders had an advantage: They could
place orders and then sell the stock to the larger firms, locking in a nice
profit. Day trading looked like a pretty good way to make a living.

==================================================

83
Chapter 5: Regulation and the Modern Trader
SOES coincided with the rise of the commercial Internet, making the late
1990s a golden era for day traders, at least in the popular imagination. More
and more discount brokerage firms offered Internet trading while Internet
stocks became wildly popular. No one needed SOES to make profits when
Pets.com and Webvan were going up in price day after day, at least for a
while. (Remember that? No? Well, it was fun while it lasted.)
Then market for tech stocks cratered in 2000, in part because so many of
the companies cratered, too. For much of the next decade, the markets were
mostly quiet while new products were introduced that appealed to day trad-
ers, including exchange-traded funds and miniature commodities contracts
(both of which are discussed in Chapter 3).
And then things got crazy. In 2008, brokerage firms failed, and the financial
markets came darn near close to collapse. All that volatility was a lot of fun
for those traders who could handle it. The brokerage firms developed larger
and more sophisticated trading programs that seemed to work well until
a single large order on the afternoon of May 6, 2010, caused everything to
go haywire. That so-called “flash crash” exposed the risks created by high-
frequency trading programs; at first, no one wanted to blame technology and
instead tried to place the blame on traders whose fingers were too big to
punch the numbers on their order-entry machines.
The financial system received generous government bailouts in the fall of
2008 in the hopes of staving off another depression. The exchanges and
the federal government created new regulations in the major institutions,
although little has changed for day traders — at least so far.
So what are the regulations that affect day traders? Well, keep reading!
Reviewing the Regulators
In the United States, financial markets receive general regulatory oversight
from two government bodies: the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Both have similar
goals: to ensure that investors and traders have adequate information to
make decisions and to prevent fraud and abuse.
Neither body has complete authority over the markets, though. Instead, much
of the responsibility for proper behavior has been given to self-regulatory
organizations that brokerage firms join, and to the exchanges themselves.
It’s not straightforward, but the overlap between these organizations seems
to ensure that problems are identified early on and that the interests of
companies, brokers, and investment managers are fairly represented.

Stock and corporate bond
market regulation
The stock and corporate bond markets are the most prominent. Regulators
are active and visible because these markets have a relatively large number
of relatively small issuers. In the currency market, by contrast, the only issu-
ers are governments, and there are a lot fewer of them than there are public
companies. When one of these companies turns out to have fraudulent num-
bers, the headlines erupt, and suddenly everyone cares about what the SEC
is up to. That’s just the first layer in regulating this market.
Given the rate at which exchanges are merging and organizations are
rearranging themselves, the following list may well have changed by the time
you read it. But even if the organizations go away, the regulations won’t.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
The SEC (www.sec.gov) is a government agency that ensures that markets
work efficiently. The Commission has five commissioners, appointed by the
President and confirmed by Congress, who serve staggered five-year terms.
This structure is designed to keep the SEC nonpartisan. One of the
commissioners is designated as the chair.
The SEC has three functions:
✓ To ensure that any companies that have securities listed on exchanges
in the United States report their financial information accurately and on
time so that investors can determine whether investing in the company
makes sense for them
✓ To provide oversight to the markets by ensuring that the exchanges and
self-regulatory organizations have sufficient regulations in place and that
those regulations are enforced
✓ To regulate mutual funds, investment advisors, and others who make
decisions for other people’s money
In addition to its standard regulations, which brokerage firms know by heart, the
SEC occasionally passes temporary regulations in times of market stress that
may affect day traders. For example, during the 2008 financial crisis, the SEC
placed restrictions on short-selling the stock of different financial companies.
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)
FINRA (www.finra.org) was formed in 2007 by the merger of the New York
Stock Exchange’s regulatory department and the National Association of
Securities Dealers. It represents and regulates all stock and bond brokerage

Chapter 5: Regulation and the Modern Trader
firms and their employees. More than 4,245 firms are members, with 630,150
employees registered to sell securities. FINRA administers background
checks and licensing exams, regulates securities trading and monitors how
firms comply, and provides information for investors so that they are better
informed about the investing process.
FINRA also requires brokers to know who their customers are and whether
an investment strategy is suitable for them, the so-called know your customer
rule. I discuss suitability later in this chapter, but for now, know that that’s a
FINRA function.
A good first stop for a day trader is FINRA’s BrokerCheck service, which you
can find at www.finra.org/Investors/ToolsCalculators/
BrokerCheck. BrokerCheck allows you to look up brokerage firms and indi-
vidual brokers to see whether they’re in good standing. If any complaints have
been filed, you can see what they are and decide for yourself how you feel
about them. This great information can help you head off problems with sales
people or brokerage firms early on. BrokerCheck has helped me a time or two
when I’ve been looking into potential business partners.
FINRA’s predecessor, the National Association of Securities Dealers, started as
a self-regulatory organization, but in the late 1960s, it saw that member firms
needed a better way to trade over-the-counter securities (securities that don’t
trade on an organized exchange like the New York Stock Exchange). In 1971, it
formed its own electronic communication network, the National Association of
Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system, or NASDAQ, pronounced as
one word: NAZ-dack. In 2000, the NASD divested NASDAQ, which is now
known only by that name, and returned to its self-regulatory organization
roots. Although the two are now separate, brokerage firms that trade
securities on NASDAQ must be members of FINRA.
The exchanges
Although the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ got out of the broker-
age oversight business when they formed FINRA, they are both involved in
regulation. In particular, these and the smaller exchanges work to ensure that
companies with securities traded on the exchange meet the criteria set for
their listings. These criteria include timely financial reporting with the SEC
and minimum numbers of shares that are actually traded. (Chapter 3 has a
description of the different exchanges and their listing requirements.)
The exchanges also monitor how securities are traded in order to look for
patterns that may point to market manipulation or insider trading. Each
exchange works with the brokerage firms that are allowed to trade on its
exchange to make sure that the brokers know who their customers are and
that the brokers have systems in place to make certain that their customers
play by the rules.

The Federal Reserve System
The Federal Reserve System, known as the Fed to friend and foe alike, is
the central bank of the United States, and one of its roles is to ensure the
integrity of the country’s financial system. Although most Federal Reserve
regulation is aimed at commercial banks, the Fed gets involved in securities
markets in times of crisis to ensure that the markets continue to function. In
the 2008 financial crisis, this involvement included arranging the mergers of
failing brokerage firms as well as buying troubled assets from different banks,
brokerage firms, and insurance companies.
The Securities Investor Protection Corporation
The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) was founded in 1970
to protect brokerage accounts from losses in the event of the firm’s bank-
ruptcy. If your firm goes under (and several have over the years, including
some that were once household names), you’ll be able to get your cash and
securities back.
The SIPC doesn’t insure against fraud, however. If you’re dealing with a firm
or a salesperson who rips you off, you have to get redress through the courts
and the Securities and Exchange Commission. You want to find a brokerage
firm that is an SIPC member, but your due diligence can’t stop there. For exam-
ple, you should check your broker through FINRA’s BrokerCheck, discussed in
the earlier section “The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).”
Likewise, almost all disputes that clients have with brokerage firms go to
arbitration, not the courts, and many people believe that the arbitration
process is biased in favor of the brokers. You have recourse, but you may
not have as much as you would like.
Treasury bond market regulation
Treasury bonds are a slightly different animal than corporate bonds. They
are issued by the U.S. government, so the Treasury Department’s Bureau of
the Public Debt (www.treasurydirect.gov) handles regulation, with the
SEC providing additional oversight. The firms that trade Treasury bonds are
FINRA members, so those rules apply, too.
Derivatives market regulation
The derivatives markets, where options and futures are traded, don’t deal in
stocks and bonds directly. Instead, they link buyers and sellers of contracts
where the value is linked to the value of an underlying security. Derivatives are

Chapter 5: Regulation and the Modern Trader
popular with day traders, because they give these traders a way to get expo-
sure to interest rates and market index performance with less capital than
would be required to buy Treasury bonds or large groups of stocks directly.
Derivatives markets have their own regulatory bodies, but they match the
format and hierarchy of stock and bond market regulation. The organizations
may not be household names, but their functions are familiar.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)
The CFTC (www.cftc.gov) is a government agency founded in 1974 to
oversee market activities in agricultural and financial commodities. The
government realized that these markets needed some regulation but were
sufficiently different from traditional stock exchanges that the SEC might not
be the best agency to handle it. The CFTC is structured similarly to the SEC,
with five commissioners holding staggered five-year terms, appointed by the
President and confirmed by Congress. One of the commissioners is desig-
nated as the chair. This structure is designed to keep the CFTC nonpartisan.
For decades, futures trading was regulated by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture because it involved nothing but agricultural commodities like
grain, pork bellies, and coffee. As traders demanded such new products as
futures on interest rates and currencies, it became clear that a new regulatory
body was needed, and that was the CFTC.
The CFTC has two main functions:
✓ To ensure that the markets are liquid and that both parties on an
options or futures transaction are able to clear (that is, to meet their
contractual obligations)
✓ To provide oversight to the markets by ensuring that the exchanges and
self-regulatory organizations have sufficient regulations in place and that
those regulations are enforced
National Futures Association (NFA)
The NFA (www.nfa.futures.org) regulates 4,200 firms with 55,000 employ-
ees who work on the different futures exchanges. It administers background
checks and licensing exams, regulates futures trading and monitors how
firms comply, and provides information for investors so that they’re better
informed about futures trading and how it differs from more traditional
investments.
Firms that handle futures are known as futures commission merchants, or
FCMs, rather than brokers. You can find information on FCMs and their
employees through the NFA’s Background Affiliation Status Information

Center, which has the clever acronym BASIC. You can access it at www.
nfa.futures.org/basicnet or through the NFA’s home page. BASIC
allows you to look up futures firms and employees to see whether they are
registered and whether any complaints have been filed against them. If any
complaints have been filed, you can see how the problem was resolved.
(Consider BASIC the futures equivalent of the legendary permanent record
that your elementary school teachers said would follow you for the rest of
your life.)
The Securities and Exchange Commission and the National Association of
Securities Dealers regulate trading in options on stocks, but the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission and the National Futures Association regulate
trading on options on futures. As the lines between derivative products get
blurrier, you may find a lot of overlap between these different organizations,
and many experts in the industry predict that the SEC and CFTC will merge
at some point. Because researching firms and people through several
self-regulatory organizations is possible, you may as well take the time to do it.
Don’t be alarmed if someone is listed one place and not the other, but do be
alarmed if a firm or person isn’t listed anywhere.
The exchanges
Unlike the stock exchanges, the derivatives exchanges haven’t merged their
regulatory functions. Thus the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), the
CME Group, InterncontinentalExchange, and other derivatives exchanges
have their own regulatory groups that ensure that their traders comply with
exchange rules and rules of other organizations, especially the CFTC. They
also develop new types of trading contracts that satisfy market demands
while complying with applicable laws. (Chapter 3 describes the different
exchanges and what they do.)
To look for patterns that may point to market manipulation or insider trad-
ing, the exchanges also monitor how derivatives are traded. Each works with
the futures commission merchants that are allowed to trade on its exchange
to ensure that the FCMs know who their customers are and have systems in
place to make sure these customers trade well, if not profitably.
On occasion, the exchanges cooperate with regulators of stock and bond mar-
kets, especially if the suspicion of fraud or market manipulation exists. After
all, insider trading in options is just as illegal as insider trading in stocks!
Foreign exchange (forex) regulation
Because it is the largest, most liquid market in the world, many day traders
are taking up trading in foreign exchange, also known as forex. But here’s

Chapter 5: Regulation and the Modern Trader
the tricky thing: These markets are not well regulated. There’s nothing to
stop someone from exchanging U.S. dollars for Canadian dollars; tourists do
it every day, often at a hotel desk or retail shop. There’s no paperwork, no
hassle — and no oversight.
Oversight isn’t necessary for a simple exchange of bucks to loonies, like when
someone at a convenience store buys a tube of Smarties (no, not the dry
tablets wrapped in cellophane but rather a fine chocolate candy not avail-
able in the States, so if you cross the border, please pick some up for me!).
Unfortunately, this situation has allowed some firms to misrepresent forex
trading to day traders as regulated when it is not, which has allowed some
day traders to get badly burned. Forewarned is forearmed, as the cliché goes.
Some online forex brokers are located outside of the United States, so they are
allowed to offer customers more leverage. Increasing leverage can increase
return, but it also adds risk. And some jurisdictions have better protections
for investors than others. Check to see where a firm is based and what laws
apply so that you’re protected.
Options and futures on currency
Most currency is traded in the spot: Traders exchange one currency for
another at the current exchange rate. The spot market is not regulated.
But many day traders prefer to pick up exposure to currency using options
and futures, to bet on where exchange rates may go and to hedge the risks
of unexpected changes. Options and futures on currency are regulated as
derivatives, through the CFTC, the NFA, and the relevant futures exchanges.
In some cases, though, FCMs get customer referrals from foreign exchange
firms that are not themselves registered, which can make it unclear whether
customers understand what they are getting into.
If you are participating in an unregulated market like forex, you can protect
yourself by doing your research so that you know what the risks and rewards
are. For that matter, every market has a few unscrupulous individuals, so
you’re always better off if you find your own facts rather than rely on someone
else. The exchanges and self-regulatory organizations all have great websites
with lots of information, and you can see a directory of them in this book’s
appendix.
Banks and oversight
Banks are responsible for most foreign exchange trading, and banks are heav-
ily regulated. Therefore the Federal Reserve Banks and the U.S. Treasury
Department pay attention to forex markets, looking for evidence of manipula-
tion and money laundering (discussed later in the chapter). This oversight
keeps the market from being a total free-for-all, even though anyone is
allowed to trade currency.

Part I: Getting Started with Day Trading
Bank oversight isn’t enough to protect you from the outlandish claims made
by crooked forex trading firms, but it does ensure that your contracts are
fulfilled.
Working with Brokers’ Rules
No matter who regulates them, brokers and futures commission merchants
have to know who their customers are and what they are up to. That leads
to some basic regulations about suitability, pattern day trading, and money
laundering — and extra paperwork for you. Don’t get too annoyed by all the
paperwork you have to fill out to open an account, because your brokerage
firm has to do even more.
Gauging suitability
Brokerage firms and FCMs have to make sure that customer activities are
appropriate. The firms need to know their customers and be sure that any
recommendations are suitable. When it comes to day trading, firms need to
be sure that customers are dealing with risk capital — money that they can
afford to lose. They also need to be sure that the customers understand the
risks that they are taking. Depending on the firm and what you’re trying to
do, you may have to submit financial statements, sign a stack of disclosures,
and verify that you have received different guides to trading.
Your financial situation is no one’s business but your own — except of course
that the various regulators want to make sure that firm employees aren’t talk-
ing customers into taking risks that they shouldn’t be taking. That’s why the
brokerage firm wants to know who you are and what money you’re using for
your trading. Sure, you can lie about it. You can tell the broker you don’t need
the $25,000 you’re putting in your account, even if that’s the money paying
for your kidney dialysis. But if you lose it, you can’t say you didn’t know
about the risks involved.
Money laundering: Al Capone or Watergate?
Although some believe that the term money Board says that the term didn’t come into use
laundry dates back to Al Capone’s attempts until the Watergate scandal, when Nixon’s
to evade taxes by owning laundries — campaign staff had to hide the money used to
businesses that had a large amount of small pay the people who broke into his opponent’s
cash transactions — the Federal Reserve psychiatrist’s office.

Chapter 5: Regulation and the Modern Trader
Making sure the money is legit
Money laundering is the process of creating a provenance for money acquired
from illegal activities. Your average drug dealer, Mafia hit man, or corrupt
politician doesn’t accept credit cards, but he really doesn’t want to keep
lots of cash in his house, either. How can he collect interest on his money if
it’s locked in a safe in his closet? And besides, his friends are an unsavory
sort; he can’t trust them to stay away from his cache. If this criminal fellow
takes all that cash to the bank, those pesky bankers will start asking a lot of
questions, because they know that most people pursuing legitimate business
activities get paid through checks or electronic direct deposit.
Hence, the felon with funds looks for a way to make it appear that the money
is legitimate. All sorts of ways to launder money exist, ranging from making
lots of small cash deposits to engaging in complicated series of financial
trades and money transfers, especially between countries, that become
difficult for investigators to trace. Sometimes these transactions look a lot
like day trading, which is why legitimate brokerage firms opening day-trade
accounts pay attention to who their customers are.
Fighting money laundering took on urgency after the September 11, 2001,
attacks, because it was clear that someone somewhere had given some bad
people a lot of cash to fund the preparation and execution of their deadly
mission. The U.S. and several other nations increased their oversight of finan-
cial activities during the aftermath of the strikes on the World Trade Center
and Pentagon. That’s why a key piece of paperwork from your broker will
be the anti-money laundering disclosure. The U.S. Treasury Department’s
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (www.fincen.gov), which investi-
gates money laundering, requires financial institutions to have enforcement
procedures in place to verify that new investments were not made from
ill-gotten funds.
In order for your brokerage firm to verify that it knows who its customers are
and where their money came from, you’ll probably have to provide the
following information when you open a brokerage account:
✓ Your name
✓ Your date of birth
✓ Your street address
✓ Your place of business
✓ Your Social Security number or Taxpayer Identification Number
✓ Your driver’s license and passport
✓ Copies of your financial statements

Part I: Getting Started with Day Trading
Following special rules for
pattern day traders
Here’s the problem for regulators: Many day traders lose money, and those
losses can be magnified by the use of leverage strategies (trading with bor-
rowed money, meaning that you can lose more money than you have in the
quest for large profits, discussed in great detail in Chapter 9). If the customer
who lost the money can’t pay up, then the broker is on the hook. If too many
customers lose money beyond what the broker can absorb, then the losses
ripple through the financial system, and that’s not good.
FINRA has a long list of rules that its member firms have to meet to stay in
business. One, still known as NASD Rule 2520 despite the merger of the NASD
that created FINRA, deals specifically with day traders. This rule sets the min-
imum account size and margin requirements for those who fit the definition
of day traders, and I’ll give you a hint: The requirements are stricter than for
other types of accounts to reflect the greater risk, although they give some
flexibility on maintenance margin.
FINRA defines day trading as the buying or selling of the same security on the
same day in a margin account (that is, using borrowed money). Execute four
or more of those day trades within five business days, and you are a pattern
day trader, unless those four or more trades were 6 percent or less of all the
trades you made over those five days.
The National Futures Association does not have a definition of day trading,
because futures trades by their very nature are short term.
Here’s why NASD Rule 2520 matters: If you are a pattern day trader, you can
have a margin of 25 percent in your account, which means you can borrow
75 percent of the cost of the securities that you’re trading. Most customers
are only allowed to borrow 50 percent. The reason for the higher amount?
Pattern day traders almost always close out their positions overnight, so the
firm has less risk of having the loan outstanding. However, you have to have
a margin account if you are a pattern day trader. That is, you have to sign an
agreement saying that you understand the risks of borrowing money, includ-
ing that you may have to repay more than is in your account and that your
broker can sell securities out from under you to ensure you pay what is owed.
Under Rule 2520, you have to have at least $25,000 in your brokerage account
at the start of the trading day. If you have losses that take your account below
that, you have to come up with more money before your broker allows you to
continue day trading. If you don’t make the deposits necessary to bring your
account up to at least $25,000 and at least 25 percent of the amount of money
you’ve borrowed within five business days, you have to trade on a cash basis
(no borrowing), assuming the firm will even let you trade.

Chapter 5: Regulation and the Modern Trader
Don’t bother trying to plead your case, because the broker has to comply
with the law. Firms pay a price if they let customers slide. In 2010, FINRA
fined brokerage firm Scottrade $200,000 for allowing customers who met the
definition of pattern day traders to trade without maintaining $25,000 in their
accounts. The firm sent customers warnings but allowed them to trade in
violation of the rule — a decision that wasn’t cool with the regulators.
The rules set by FINRA and other self-regulatory organizations are minimum
requirements. Brokerage firms are free to set higher limits for account size and
borrowing, and many do in order to manage their own risks better.
Reporting taxes
On top of the identity paperwork, you have forms to fill out for tax report-
ing. IRS Form W9 keeps your taxpayer information on record. Then, after the
end of the year, the brokerage firm sends you form 1099B listing how much
money you made in your account, breaking it out between income and capital
gains on stocks, bonds, options, and futures. You use that to ensure that the
taxman gets his cut. Tax issues are covered in Chapter 15, but for now, just
keep in mind that your federal, state, and local taxing authorities are paying
attention to how well your trading does.
Watching Out for Insider Trading
The regulations about suitability and money laundering are very clear. You
get a bunch of forms, you read them, you sign them, you present documenta-
tion, and everyone is happy. The rules that keep the markets functioning are
clear and easy to follow.
But another set of rules also keeps markets functioning — namely, that no
one has an unfair information advantage. If you knew ahead of time about big
merger announcements, interest-rate decisions by the Federal Reserve, or a
new sugar substitute that would eliminate demand for corn syrup, you could
make a lot of money in the stock market, trading options on interest-rate
futures or playing in the grain futures market. In doing so, however, you’d
have an unfair advantage. If everyone believed that such unfair advantages
were common, then they would be unwilling to participate in the capital
markets, and that would harm the economy.
Insider trading is not well defined. Insider information includes any nonpublic
information that a reasonable person would consider when deciding whether
to buy or sell a security, and that’s a pretty vague standard — especially
because the whole purpose of research is to combine bits of immaterial
information together to make investment decisions.

Part I: Getting Started with Day Trading
Day traders, who buy and sell so quickly, can be susceptible to hot tips. They
may be participating in message boards or chat services where hot rumors
can get the blood flowing on a dull day. If these hot tips are actually inside
information, though, the trader can become liable. If you get great informa-
tion from someone who is in a position to know — an officer, a director, a
lawyer, an investment banker — and you act on this information in your
trades or share it with someone who then acts on it, you may be looking at
stiff penalties. Civil penalties are usually three times your profits, but the
government may decide that your trading was part of a criminal enterprise,
making the potential penalties much greater.
Insider trading is difficult to prove, so federal regulators use other tools to
punish those it suspects of making improper profits. Martha Stewart wasn’t
sent to prison on insider trading charges; she was charged with obstructing
justice by lying to investigators about what happened.
Whenever a big announcement is made, such as a merger, the exchanges go
back and review trading for the past several days to see whether any unusual
activities occurred in relevant securities and derivatives. Then they start
tracing that activity back to the traders involved through the brokerage firms
to see whether the activity was coincidence or part of a pattern.
By the way, most tips turn out to be groundless, or at least not as interesting
to the market as it seems like they will be. Real insider information is hard to
get, but starting a rumor is easy-peasy.
The bottom line is this: You may never come across inside information. But if a
tip seems too good to be true, it probably is, so be careful.
Preparing for Rule Changes
in Crisis Conditions
Many regulators sit on the sidelines, watching the markets with little interac-
tion until a big crisis hits. When that happens, they rush in to calm the markets,
often by setting up new and temporary rules until everyone is calm and normal
market activities can resume.
Three main types of rules apply only in a crisis. They’re circuit breakers,
short-selling restrictions, and broken trades.
Circuit breakers are temporary halts on trading that apply when the market
has excessive volatility, at least in the eye of the New York Stock Exchange.
(Traders love volatility, but the NYSE isn’t so keen.) Here’s how circuit
breakers work:

Chapter 5: Regulation and the Modern Trader
✓ If the Dow Jones Industrial Average falls by 10 percent before 2 p.m.
New York time, trading stops for one hour. If it falls that much between
2 p.m. and 2:30 p.m., trading stops for a half hour. If it falls that much
after 2:30 p.m., trading continues until the bell rings at 4 p.m. or until it
hits the 20 percent mark, at which point it’s done for the day.
✓ If the Dow Jones Industrial Average falls by 20 percent before 1 p.m.
New York time, trading stops for two hours. If it falls that much between
1 p.m. and 2 p.m., trading stops for one hour. If it falls that much after
2 p.m., trading closes for the day.
✓ If the Dow Jones Industrial Average falls by 30 percent, trading ends
for the day, although it most likely would have been shut down already
due to the 20 percent rule.
The other exchanges don’t have to follow the New York Stock Exchange rules,
but they often do. In addition, the NYSE has the right to halt trading in any
one security if it falls by more than 10 percent in a five-minute period.
Short-selling restrictions can be put into place if the regulatory authorities
believe that action in one industry is dragging down the entire market. In the
fall of 2008, short-selling was temporarily banned on financial services stocks.
Finally, if the market really goes haywire, the exchanges have the right to
break trades, cancelling the buy and sell orders that looked too good to be
true. When the Flash Crash of 2010 hit, many traders were thrilled to find that
they could buy shares in illustrious and profitable corporations for a frac-
tion of their usual share price. They weren’t so thrilled when the exchanges
cancelled those trades.
The Securities and Exchange Commission allows stock exchanges to break
trades whenever prices in the system are “clearly erroneous,” especially if a
computer malfunction is involved. Some traders allege that trades are broken
even if the prices are not clearly erroneous, denying them a sure-thing profit.
The guidelines allow exchanges to consider breaking a trade whenever prices
vary by 10 percent for stocks priced under $25, 5 percent for stocks priced
between $25 and $50, and 3 percent of stocks priced over $50. Also, the review
process should begin within 30 minutes of the trade.
If you see a fabulous bargain, go ahead and make the trade, but know that it
may be cancelled if that great price was due to an error.
Taking on Partners
After your day trading proves to be wildly successful, you may want to take
on partners to give you more trading capital and a slightly more regular
income from the management fees. You can take on partners, but it’s a lot of
work, and once again, you must follow certain rules and procedures.

Part I: Getting Started with Day Trading
If you’re trading options and futures and are operating a commodity pool
or working as a commodity trading advisor, you need to register with the
National Futures Association. If you’re trading stocks and bonds, you have to
register with the Securities and Exchange Commission unless you meet the
exemption tests that let you operate as a hedge fund instead.
Registration is not a do-it-yourself project. For that matter, neither is ensuring
that you are exempt from registration even though you have partners. An
error or omission may have tremendous repercussions down the line, includ-
ing fines or jail time. If you want to take on partners for your trading business,
spend the money for qualified legal advice. Doing so protects you and shows
prospective customers that you’re serious about your business.
To qualify as a hedge fund, which is a private investment partnership that
does not qualify for registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
you have to deal only with accredited investors (those with at least $1 million
in net worth or an annual income of $200,000) or qualified purchasers (those
with $5 million in investable assets). The idea is that these people understand
the risks they’re taking and have enough money to lose. Hedge funds do not
have to register with the SEC, but they may have to register with the NFA.
Whether or not you need to register, prospective investors will want to see
proof that you know what you’re doing and know how to handle their money.
That step is beyond the scope of this book, but it’s something for a
successful day trader to consider.

Managing Your Money
and Positions
In This Chapter
▶ Calculating expected return
▶ Knowing your probability of ruin
▶ Mulling over the many methods of money management
▶ Figuring out what money management has to do with returns
▶ Deciding what to do with your profits
Y
ou can’t trade if you don’t have money. Sure, your brokerage firm will
loan you some funds, but only if you have some of your own funds to
stake as margin. You have to keep some powder dry.
So how much of your money should you put on the line each time you trade?
Risk too much, and you can be put out of business when you lose your capi-
tal. Risk too little, and you can be put out of business because you can’t make
enough money to cover your costs and time.
Over time, many academic theorists and experienced traders have developed
different systems of money management designed to help traders, investors,
and even gamblers manage their money in such a way as to maximize return
while protecting capital. In this chapter, I explain how some of the better-
known systems work so that you can figure out how to best apply them to
your own trading. Doing so can help you protect your trading funds and figure
out what size trades to enter so that you can stay trading as long as you like.
Note: Some of the material in this chapter is related to leverage, which is
borrowing money to trade. Because leverage can dramatically increase the
money that you have available to trade, as well as the risk and return profile
of the trades that you make, it affects how you manage your money. Flip to
Chapter 9 for more information on leverage and why you may want to use it.

Setting Your Earnings Expectations
Return is a function of risk. If you want a guaranteed return, go down to
your bank and open a federally insured deposit account. The returns will be
almost comically low, but you’ll have no risk. If you want anything higher
than what your bank is quoting, well, you have to take on at least a little bit
of risk. When you take on risk, you increase both your likelihood of return
and your likelihood of loss.
Successful day traders lose money all the time, but they’re able to keep trad-
ing. If you’re looking at a trade with even a 0.5 percent chance of 100 percent
loss, the odds indicate that you would lose everything over the course of
200 trades — but only if you put all your money into each trade. If you put
only some of your money in that trade, then you’ll never lose everything in it.
Sure, you won’t get all of the upside potential, but you’ll be able to hit
the potential high return more often because you can make that trade
more often.
The key term in investing is diversification: If your money is spread out among
different assets, your long-return return will be higher for less total risk than if
you commit to only one asset.
Trading isn’t investing, but the power of diversification holds. If you divide
your money among a few different trades or always keep some cash on
hand in your account for the next trade, you’ll almost definitely make more
money in the long run than if you put all your money on one idea. Sure, risk-
ing everything on one idea may work a few times, but are you that lucky? If
you’re smart about your money management, you don’t need luck.
Finding your expected return
Before you can figure out how to manage your money, you need to figure
out how much money you can expect to make. This amount is your expected
return, although some traders prefer the word expectancy. You start by laying
out your trading system and testing it (described in Chapter 16). You’re
looking for four numbers:
✓ How many of your trades are losers?
✓ What’s the typical percentage loss on a losing trade?
✓ How many of your trades are winners?
✓ What’s the typical percentage gain on a winning trade?



==================================================
                     PAGE 117                     
==================================================

101
Chapter 6: Managing Your Money and Positions
Say that you determine that a certain trade loses 40 percent of the time,
and it loses 1 percent. Sixty percent of the time, the trade wins, and winning
trades are up 1.5 percent. With these numbers, you can calculate your
per-trade expected return, like this:
% of losing trades × loss on losing trades + % of winning trades × gain on
winning trades = expected return
Which in this example works out to be
0.40 × –0.01 + 0.60 × 0.015 = –0.004 + 0.009 = 0.005, which is the same as 0.5%.
On average, then, you would expect to earn 0.5 percent on every trade you
make. Make enough trades with enough money, and it adds up.
You are more likely to make more money if you have a high expectation of
winning trades and if those winners are expected to perform well. As long as
probability of loss exists, you stand to lose money.
Determining your probability of ruin
Expected return is the happy number. It’s how much money you can expect
to make if you stay in the trading game. But it has a counterpart that, while
not so happy, is at least as important: the probability of ruin.
Yes, ruin.
As long as some probability of loss exists, no matter how small, there is some
probability that you can lose everything when you’re trading. How much
you can lose depends on how large each trade is relative to your account,
the likelihood of each trade having a loss, and the size of the losses as they
occur. (Don’t think it can happen? That’s what the top executives at AIG, Bear
Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and Washington Mutual said.)
Many traders who have winning trading strategies find themselves shut down
because a few bad trades ruined them. Every trader has some losses, but these
losses don’t have to end your trading career if you know the probability of ruin
and how to use it. The equation you use to calculate the probability of ruin (R) is
1−A C
R=
[ ]
1+A
In this equation, A is the advantage on each trade. That’s the difference
between the percentage of winning trades and the percentage of losing trades.

Part II: Exploring Popular Day-Trading Strategies
In the expected return example discussed earlier, trades win 60 percent of
the time and lose everything 40 percent of the time. In that case, the trader’s
advantage would be
60% – 40% = 20%
And c is the number of trades in an account. Assume that you’re dividing the
account into ten equal parts, with the plan of making ten trades today. The
probability of ruin today is 1.7 percent, as shown in this equation:
1 − 0.20 10
1.7%=
[ ]
1+0.20
Now 1.7 percent isn’t a high likelihood of ruin, but it’s not zero, either. It can
happen. If your advantage is smaller, if the expected loss is larger, or if the
number of trades is fewer, then the likelihood becomes even higher.
Figure 6-1 shows you the relationship between the trader’s advantage,
number of trades, and the corresponding probability of ruin, rounded to
the nearest percentage.

The bigger the edge and the more trades you can make, the lower your
probability of ruin. Now, this model is a simplification in that it assumes
that a losing trade goes to zero, and that’s not always the case. In fact, if
you use stops (automatic buy and sell orders, described in Chapter 2), you
should never have a 100 percent loss. But you can see steady erosion in your
account that will make it harder for you to make money. Hence, probability
of ruin is a useful calculation that shows whether you’ll lose money in the
long run.
The more trades you can make with your account, the lower your probability
of ruin. That’s why money management is a key part of risk management.

Chapter 6: Managing Your Money and Positions
Gaining Advantage with a
Money-Management Plan
As long as there’s some chance of losing all your money, you want to avoid
betting it all on any one trade. But as long as there’s a chance of making
money, you want to have enough exposure to a winning trade so that you can
post good profits. How do you figure out how much money to risk?
Later in this chapter, I describe some of the different money-management
systems that traders use to figure out how much money to risk per trade. But
first, I want to explain the logic behind a money-management system so that
you understand why you need one. That way, you can better manage your
funds and improve the dollar returns to your trading.
Minimizing damage while
increasing opportunity
Expected return gives you an idea of how much you can get from a trade on
average, but it doesn’t tell you how much that return may vary from trade to
trade. The average of 9, 10, and 11 is 10; the average of –90, 10, and 110 is also
10. The first number series is a lot narrower than the second. The wider the
range of returns that a strategy has, the more volatile it is.
Measuring volatility
You can measure volatility in several ways. One the underlying security or market index

Part II: Exploring Popular Day-Trading Strategies
Day traders seek more volatile securities because they offer more opportunities
to make money during any given day. For this reason, they need to have ways
to minimize the damage that may occur while being able to capitalize on the
upward swings. Money management can help with that.
Staying in the market longer
You have only a limited amount of money to trade. Whether it’s $1,000 or
$1,000,000, once the money’s gone, you’re out. The problem is that you can
have a long string of losing trades before the markets go in a direction that
favors you and your system.
Say you trade 100 percent of your account. If you have one trade that goes
down 100 percent, then you have nothing. If you divide your account into
ten parts, then you can have ten total losers before you’re out. If you start
with ten equal parts and double each time you lose, you can be out after four
losing trades.
On the other hand, if you divide your account into 100 portions, then you can
endure 100 losing trades. If you trade fractions of your account, then you can
keep going indefinitely, or at least until you get down to a level that’s too low
to place a minimum order. (That’s the philosophy behind the Kelly Criterion,
described later in this chapter.) Money management can keep you in the
game longer, and that gives you more opportunities to place winning trades.
The riskier your trading strategy, the more thought you need to put into money
management. Otherwise, you can find yourself out of the market in no time.
Getting out before you lose everything
A money-management system works best if the trader using it knows when to
close out a position. You have to have a trading plan and know when you’re
willing to get out: at the recent high? A few ticks below the most recent high?
A few ticks up from where you entered? A few ticks below where you entered,
to limit your losses?
Sometimes the market will go nuts, and you won’t be able to get out as
quickly as you’d like. In these situations, those tiny chances of losing every-
thing kick in, and good money management offers the most protection.
On more ordinary trading days, be sure to supplement your position size and
capital protection efforts with ordinary trading tools: trade planning and use
of stop and limit orders. You can review these in Chapter 2.

Accounting for opportunity costs
Opportunity cost is the value you give up because you choose to do some-
thing else. In trading, each dollar you commit to one trade is a dollar that
you cannot commit to another trade. Thus, each dollar you trade car-
ries some opportunity cost, and good traders seek to minimize this cost.
During the course of the trading day, you may see several great trades,
and some opportunities will show up before you are ready to close out a
different trade.
Because a money-management system holds back some of your capital, you
are more likely to have funds to take advantage of these opportunities than
if you allocate your cash willy-nilly. Your plan may cause you to miss some
trades, and that’s okay. If you believe that you are missing too many, though,
you may want to experiment with another system to see whether it gives you
better results. Whatever you do, don’t ignore money management.
If you have committed all your capital to one trade, you miss out on the
second. That alone is a good reason to keep some money on the table each
time you trade.
Examining Styles of Money
Management
Over the years, traders have developed many different ways to manage their
money. Some money-management strategies are rooted in superstition, but
most are based on different statistical probability theories. The underly-
ing idea is that you should never place all of your money in a single trade.
Instead, you should put in an amount appropriate given the level of volatility.
Otherwise, you risk losing everything too soon.
Calculating position size under many of these formulas is tricky stuff.
That’s why brokerage firms and trading software packages often include
money-management calculators. Check Chapter 11 for more information on the
brokers and Chapter 12 for more on different software and research services.
In the following sections, I offer a sampling of the many different money-
management methods available. Other methods are out there, and none is
suitable to all markets all the time. If you trade both options and stocks, you
may want to use one system for option trades and another for stock trades.
And if that’s your situation, you have one big money-management decision
to make before you begin: how much money to allocate to each market!

Limiting portions: Fixed fractional
Fixed-fractional trading assumes that you want to limit each trade to a set
portion of your total account, often between 2 and 10 percent. Within that
range, you trade a larger percentage of money in less risky trades and a
smaller amount of money for more risky trades. (In other words, this method
isn’t all that “fixed,” but no one asked me to pick a name for the system!)
Here’s the fixed fractional equation for calculating fixed-fractional trade
proportions.
equity
N =f ( )
traderisk
| |
N is the number of contracts or shares of stock you should trade, f is the
fixed fraction of your account that you have decided to trade, equity is the
value of your total account, and trade risk is the amount of money you could
lose on the transaction. Because trade risk is a negative number, you need
to convert it to a positive number to make the equation work. Those vertical
bars in the equation (| |) are the sign for absolute value, and that means that
you convert the number between them to a positive number.
Here’s an example that uses the equation. Assume that you’ve decided to
limit each trade to 10 percent of your account, you have a $20,000 account,
and you are looking at contracts with a value of $3,500. You want to set your
trade based on the assumption that the contracts go to zero, to look at the
worst-case scenario. Plugging the numbers into the equation and doing the
math gives you
20,000
0.57=0.10(
)
−3,500
| |
| |
Of course, you probably can’t trade 0.57 of a contract, so in this case, you
would have to round up to one.
Protecting profits: Fixed ratio
Developed by a trader named Ryan Jones, the fixed-ratio money-management
system is used in trading options and futures. The idea behind fixed-ratio
trading is to help you increase your exposure to the market while protecting
your accumulated profits.

Chapter 6: Managing Your Money and Positions
To find the optimal number of options or futures contracts to trade, you use
this equation
N =0.50 1+8(P∕Δ)+1
�√ �
N is the number of contracts or shares of stock that you should trade, P is
your accumulated profit to date, and Δ (delta) is the dollar amount you would
need before you could trade a second contract or another lot of stock. (Don’t
confuse this delta with the delta used to measure of volatility; see the sidebar
“Measuring volatility” for more information.)
For example, the minimum margin for Chicago Mercantile Exchange E-mini
S&P 500 futures contract, which gives you exposure to the Standard & Poor’s
500 stock index, is $3,500. Until you have another $3,500 in your account, you
can’t trade a second contract. If you use fixed-ratio money management to
trade this future, your delta is $3,500.
Here’s an example that uses fixed-ration calculation. Assume your delta is
$3,500 and that you have $10,000 in account profits. If you plug in the
numbers and calculate, you see that you should trade 2.94 contracts:
2.94=0.50(√1+8 10,000∕3,500 +1)
( )
What this means is that you can trade only one or two contracts, nothing
in between. That’s one of the imperfections of most money-management
systems.
Sticking to 10 percent: Gann
William Gann developed a complicated system for identifying securities
trades. Part of his system was a list of rules for managing money, and many
traders follow that if nothing else.
The primary rule is this: Divide your money into ten equal parts and never
place more than one 10 percent portion on a single trade. This strategy helps
control your risk, whether or not you use Gann. (Gann is discussed in
Chapter 7.)

Part II: Exploring Popular Day-Trading Strategies
Finding the ideal percentage:
Kelly Criterion
The Kelly Criterion lets you determine the ideal percentage of your portfolio
to put at risk. To calculate how much of your portfolio to put at risk, you
need to know what percentage of your trades are expected to win, the return
from a winning trade, and the ratio performance of winning trades to losing
trades. The shorthand that many traders use for the Kelly Criterion is edge
divided by odds, and in practice, the formula looks like this:
1−W
Kelly%=W −
( )
R
W is the percentage of winning trades, and R is the ratio of the average gain
of the winning trades relative to the average loss of the losing trades.
To see this formula in action, consider a system that loses 40 percent of the
time with a loss of 1 percent and that wins 60 percent of the time with a gain
of 1.5 percent. (Look familiar? I used this same example at the beginning of
the chapter.) Plugging that info into the Kelly formula, the right percentage to
trade is 33.3 percent:
1−W 1−0.60
Kelly%=W −
(
)=0.60−
(
)=3.33%
R 0.015∕0.010
In this situation, as long as you limit your trades to no more than 33 percent
of your capital, you should never run out of money. The problem, of course,
is that if you have a long string of losses, you can find yourself with too little
money to execute a trade. Many traders use a “half-Kelly” strategy, limiting
each trade to half the amount indicated by the Kelly Criterion, as a way to
keep the trading account from shrinking too quickly. They are especially
likely to do this if the Kelly Criterion generates a number greater than about
20 percent, as it does in this example.
This money-management method emerged from statistical work done at Bell
Laboratories in the 1950s. The goal was to figure out the best ways to manage
signal-noise issues in long-distance telephone communications. Very quickly,
the mathematicians who worked on it saw that it could be applied to gam-
bling, and in no time, the formula took off. In fact, a math professor, Edward
O. Thorpe, used the Kelly Criterion with great success to win big at blackjack
in Las Vegas in the early 1960s, which led to a change in casino rules.
In a casino, the rules are against you. If you find an edge, in no time, you’ll be
asked to leave, and the rules may be changed. In the financial markets, the
odds are even or slightly in your favor, so you have a better opportunity to
make money by practicing your strategies.

Chapter 6: Managing Your Money and Positions
Doubling down: Martingale
The martingale style of money management is common with serious casino
gamblers, and many traders apply it as well. It’s designed to improve the
amount of money you can earn in a game that has even odds. Most casino odds
favor the house (roulette wheels used to be evenly black and red, but casinos
found that they could make more money if they inserted a green slice for zero,
thus throwing off the odds). Day trading, on the other hand, is a zero-sum game,
especially in the options and futures markets. For every winner, there is a loser,
so the odds of any one trade being successful are even. The martingale system
is designed to work in any market where the odds are even or in your favor.
Under the martingale strategy, you start with a set amount per trade, say
$2,000. If your trade succeeds, you trade another $2,000. If your trade loses,
you double your next order (after you close or limit the first trade) so that
you can win back your loss. (You may have heard gamblers talk about
doubling down? Well, this is what they’re doing.)
Under the martingale system, you always come out ahead as long as you have
an infinite amount of money to trade. See the problem? You can run out of
money before you have a trade that works. The market, on the other hand, has
almost infinite resources because of the huge volume of participants coming
and going all over the world. In short, you’re at an enormous disadvantage. As
long as you have a disadvantage, thoughtful money management is critical.
Letting a program guide you:
Monte Carlo simulation
If you have the programming expertise or buy the right software, you can run
what’s called a Monte Carlo simulation, named for the famous casino town.
In this calculation, you enter in your risk and return parameters and your
account value and let the program run. It then returns the optimal trade size.
The system is not perfect; it can’t incorporate every market situation that
you’ll face, and it has the fractional trade problem that the other systems do.
But it has one big advantage: It can incorporate random changes in the
markets in ways that simpler money-management models cannot.
There are different schools of thought about the statistical theories that go
into a Monte Carlo simulation. Fortunately, you don’t have to know them to
use the system’s estimates of the return in the market to help you determine
your position sizes as the market changes.
A Monte Carlo simulation is more dynamic than most of the other money-
management systems, but it isn’t as easy to use. For that reason, it isn’t a do-it-
yourself project unless you have extensive experience creating these programs.
If you are interested, you need to find a suitable program. Many brokerage firms

include Monte Carlo simulation packages in their day trading platforms. If you
want to find stand-alone software, two options are offered by Probilitech, a low-
end system available at http://probilitech.com, and Oracle Corporation’s
Crystal Ball, a high-end system discussed at www.oracle.com/us/products/
middleware/bus-int/crystalball/index.html.
Considering past performance: Optimal F
The Optimal F system of money management was devised by Ralph Vince, and
he’s written several books about this and other money-management issues
(see the appendix for more information). The idea is that you determine the
ideal fraction of your money to allocate per trade based on past performance.
If your Optimal F is 18 percent, then each trade should be 18 percent of your
account — no more, no less. The system is similar to the fixed-fraction and
fixed-ratio methods discussed earlier but with a few differences.
To find the number of shares of stock, N, to trade under Optimal F, you use
this equation:
F × equity
N = ( risk )
price
F is a factor based on the basis of historical data, risk is the biggest percent-
age loss that you experienced in the past, equity is the amount of money in
your account, and price is the current price. Using these numbers, you can
find the contracts or shares you need to buy.
Here’s an example: Assume your account has $25,000, your biggest loss (risk)
was 40 percent, your F is 30 percent, and you’re looking at a stock trading at
$25 per share. Plug in the numbers and calculation to find that you should
buy 750 shares:
0.30× 25,000
750= ( 0.40 )
25
The Optimal F number itself is a mean based on historical trade results. The
risk number is also based on past returns, and that’s one problem with this
method: It kicks in only after you have some trade data. A second problem is
that you need to set up a spreadsheet to calculate it (so read Ralph Vince’s
book if you want to try it out). Some traders only use Optimal F in certain
market conditions, in part because the history changes each time a trade is
made, and that history doesn’t always lead to usable numbers.

Chapter 6: Managing Your Money and Positions
Seeing How Money Management
Affects Your Return
Describing why you need money management is one thing, but showing you
how it works is more fun. And because I love making spreadsheets (we all
need a hobby, right?), I pulled one together to show you how different ways
of managing your money may affect your return.
In Figure 6-2, I started with the expected return assumptions that I used
in the earlier example: 40 percent of the time a trade loses, and it loses 1
percent. The trade wins 60 percent of the time, and winning trades are up
1.5 percent. I pick a hypothetical account of $20,000 and set up mock trades
using these expected return numbers. Then I compared the performance
of martingale and Kelly money management to betting the whole account
each time.
As the calculations in Figure 6-2 show, you end up with the most money
from trading the entire account. That doesn’t mean you always get the
most money this way, just that that’s how the numbers worked out in this
case, given the 60/40 win ratio and a 3/2 winning size/losing size ratio.
(Keep in mind that if you were using a Kelly or martingale system, you’d
probably be doing something with the rest of the account rather than just
letting it sit there.)
This is just an example, applying some different strategies to different hypo-
thetical returns. I’m not recommending any one system over another. The best
system for you depends on what assets you’re trading, your personal trading
style, and how much money you have to trade.
Planning for Your Profits
In addition to determining how much to trade each time you place an order,
you need a plan for what to do with the profits that accumulate in your
account. That’s as much a part of money management as calculating your
probability of ruin and determining trade size.
Are you going to add the money to your account and trade it as before?
Leverage your profits by trading them more aggressively than your core
account? Pull money out and put it into long-term investments? Or a
combination of the three? The following sections explore some of your
options.

Compounding interest
Compound interest is a simple concept: Every time you get a return, that
return goes into your account. You keep earning a return on it, which
increases your account size some more. You keep earning a return on
your return, and pretty soon, the numbers get to be pretty big.
To benefit from that compounding, many traders add their profits back
into their accounts and keep trading them as a way to build account size.
Although day traders earn little to no interest (which is compensation for
loaning out money — say, by buying bonds), the basic principle holds: By
returning profits to the trading account to generate even more profits, the
account should grow over time.

Chapter 6: Managing Your Money and Positions
This practice of keeping profits in the account to trade makes a lot of sense for
smaller traders who want to build their accounts and take more significant
positions over time.
Pyramiding power
Pyramiding involves taking trading profits and borrowing heavily against them
to generate even more profits. Traders usually do this during the day, using
unrealized profits in trades that are not yet closed as collateral for loans used
to establish new positions. If the new positions are profitable, the trader can
keep borrowing until it’s time to close everything at the end of the day.
Pyramiding works great as long as the markets are moving in the right direc-
tion. If all the positions in the pyramid remain profitable, you can make a lot of
money during the course of the day. But if one of those positions turns against
you, then the structure collapses and you end up with a call on your margin.
Figure 6-3 starts with an initial trade of $2,000 and assumes a return of 10 per-
cent on each transaction — not realistic, necessarily, but it makes for a nice
chart. If the profits from each trade are used as collateral for borrowing, and
if that 10 percent return holds all day, then the trader can make 17 percent by
pyramiding those gains. If a reversal hits before the end of the trading session
and the positions lose 10 percent, then pyramiding magnifies the losses —
assuming your broker would let you keep borrowing. After all, the borrowed
money has to be repaid regardless of what happens in the market.
Pyramiding is not related to a pyramid scheme. In trading terms, pyramiding
is a way to borrow against your profits to generate even bigger profits. A pyr-
amid scheme is a fraud that requires participants to recruit new members,
and fees paid by the new members go to the older ones. Eventually, the pyra-
mid collapses because recruiting new members gets too difficult and those at
the bottom get nothing. Be aware that some investment frauds have been
structured as pyramid schemes. Steer clear of deals that sound fabulous and
require you to recruit others.
Pyramiding increases your trading risk but also your expected return. It’s a
useful way to grow a portion of your trading account, especially when the
market is favoring your trading system. This technique is good for medium-
sized accounts, which have enough money that, if a pyramid were to collapse
on you, you’d still have enough to stay in the market.
Making regular withdrawals
Because day trading can be so risky, many traders look to diversify their total
financial risk. One way to do this is to pull money out of the trading account to
put into a less volatile long-term investment. Many traders routinely pull out

a percentage of their profits and put that money into government bonds, a low-
risk mutual fund, or real estate. None of these investments is as glamorous or
exciting as day trading, but that’s the point: Trading is hard work, and anyone
can lose money any day, no matter how big his account is or how much money
he’s made so far. By moving some money out, a trader can build a cushion for
a bad trading stretch, prepare for retirement, and have some money to walk
away for a short period or even forever. Having money in low-risk investments
can greatly reduce the stress and the fear that go with trading.
The larger the account, the easier it is to pull money out, but even smaller
traders should consider taking 5 or 10 percent of each quarter’s profits and
moving them into another type of investment. Many brokerage firms can set
up automatic withdrawal plans that zap money from your trading account
to a stock or bond mutual fund if you don’t trust yourself to do it.

n some ways, day trading is easy. Open up an account with a brokerage
firm and off you go, buying and selling securities! But how are you going
to know when to buy and when to sell? That’s not a simple matter. Most day
traders fail because it’s easy to place the order but hard to know whether the
order is the right one.
Traders use different research systems to evaluate the market and have
access to tools that can help them figure out when a security is likely to go
up in price and when it is likely to go down. Two primary types of invest-
ment research systems exist: technical analysis and fundamental analysis.
Technical analysis, which is widely used by day traders, looks at the supply
and demand for a security and how it shows up in price data. Fundamental
analysis, which is less commonly used by day traders, looks at the financial
and operational factors that affect a security’s value. This chapter tells you
what you need to know about each.
Don’t be fooled by anyone offering to sell you a guaranteed system for
making money in day trading. Anyone with a surefire system has already
made a fortune and retired to a private island in a tropical climate. He or she
is too busy enjoying drinks with umbrellas in them to share that trading
system with you.

Part II: Exploring Popular Day-Trading Strategies
Comparing Research Techniques
Used in Day Trading
Day traders need to make decisions fast, and they need to have a framework
for doing so. That’s why they rely on research. But what kind? Most day trad-
ers rely heavily on technical research, which is an analysis of charts formed
by price patterns to measure the relative supply and demand for the
security. But some people use fundamental analysis to help inform their
decisions, too.
Research systems fall into two categories: fundamental and technical:
✓ Fundamental research looks at the specific factors that affect a secu-
rity’s value. What’s the relationship between the trade deficit and futures
on two-year treasury notes? What’s the prediction for summer rainfall in
Iowa, and how will that affect December corn futures? How dependent is
a company on new products to generate earnings growth?
✓ Technical research looks at the supply and demand for the security
itself. Are people buying more and more shares? Is the price going up
a lot as they buy more, or does the price go up just a little bit? Does it
seem like everyone who is likely to buy has already bought, and what
does that mean for the future price?
What direction is your research?
Securities are affected by matters specific to each type and by huge global
macroeconomic factors that affect every security in different ways. Some
traders prefer to think of the big picture first, whereas others start small.
And some use a combination of the two approaches. Neither is better; each is
simply a different perspective on what’s happening in the markets.
Top-down research
With a top-down approach, the trader looks at the big economic factors: inter-
est rates, exchange rates, government policies, and the like. How will these
things affect a particular sector or security? Is this a good time to buy stocks
or short interest-rate futures? The top-down approach can help evaluate the
prices in big market sectors, and it can also help determine what factors are
affecting trading in a subsector. You don’t have to trade stock market index
futures to know that the outlook for the overall stock market will have an
effect on the trading of any specific company’s stock.

Chapter 7: Technical Analysis 101
Bottom-up research
Bottom-up analysis looks at the specific performance of the asset. It looks
at the company’s prospects and then works backward to figure out how it
will get there. What has to happen for a company’s stock price to go up 20
percent? What earnings does it have to report, what types of buyers have to
materialize, and what else has to happen in the economy?
Fundamental research
Day traders do very little fundamental research. Sure, they know that demand
for ethanol affects corn prices, but they really want to know what the price
will do right now relative to where the price was a few minutes ago. How a
proposed farm bill might affect ethanol prices in six years doesn’t figure into
day trading.
Knowing a little bit about the fundamentals — those basic facts that affect
the supply and demand for a security in all markets — can help the day
trader respond better to news events. It can also give you a better feel for
when swing trading (holding a position for several days) will generate a
better profit than closing out every night. But knowing a lot can drag a day
trader down.
Fundamental analysis can actually hurt you in day trading, because you may
start making decisions for the wrong reasons. If you know too much about the
fundamentals, you may start considering long-term outlooks instead of short-
term activity. For example, many people buy Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500
Index mutual funds for their retirement accounts because they believe that in
the long run, the market will go up. That does not mean that people should
trade E-mini S&P futures or an S&P exchange-traded fund today, because a lot
of zigzagging can happen between now and the arrival of the long-run price
appreciation.
Fundamental research falls into two main categories: top-down and bottom-up.
As I mention earlier, top-down starts with broad economic considerations
and then looks at how those will affect a specific security. Bottom-up looks at
specific securities and then determines whether those are good buys or sells
right now.
If you love the very idea of fundamental research, then day trading is proba-
bly not for you. Day trading requires quick responses to price changes, not
a careful understanding of accounting methods and business trends. A little
fundamental analysis can be helpful in day trading, but a lot can slow
you down.

Technical analysis
Information about the price, time, and volume of a security’s trading can be
plotted on a chart. The plots form patterns that can be analyzed to show
what happened. How did the supply and demand for a security change, and
why? And what does that mean for future supply and demand? Technical
analysis is based on the premise that securities prices move in trends and
that those trends repeat themselves over time. Therefore, a trader who can
recognize a trend on the charts can determine where prices are most likely to
go until some unforeseen event comes along that creates a new trend.
Most traders rely on software to spot patterns because it makes them easier
to find and to act upon. Remember that the vast volume of short-term trading
takes place by computer algorithm. You can’t beat them, so join them.
The basic element of technical analysis is a bar, which shows you the high,
low, open, and closing price of a security for a given day. It looks like the one
shown in Figure 7-1.

Chapter 7: Technical Analysis 101
In most markets, every day generates a new bar (many traders talk about
bars instead of days, and they aren’t talking about where they go after work).
A collection of bars, with all their different high, low, open, and close points,
is put together into a larger chart. Often, a plot of the volume for each bar
runs underneath, with the result looking like Figure 7-2.

Many patterns formed in the charts are associated with future price moves.
Technical analysts thus spend a lot of time looking at the charts to see
whether they can predict what’s going to happen. Many software packages
(some of which are discussed in Chapter 12) send traders signals when cer-
tain technical patterns occur so that the traders can place orders accordingly.
Technical analysis is a way to measure the supply and demand in the market.
It’s a tool for analyzing the markets, not predicting them. If deciphering the
meaning of the data were that easy, everyone would be able to make money
in the markets.
Price changes
Market observers debate market efficiency all the time. In an efficient market,
all information about a security is already included in the security’s price, so
there’s no point to doing any research at all. Few market participants are will-
ing to go that far, but they concede the point that the price is the single most
important summary of information about a company. That means that techni-
cal analysis, looking at how the price changes over time, is a way of learning
about whether a security’s prospects are improving or getting worse.
Volume changes
The basic bar shows how price changed during the day, but adding volume
information tells the other part of the story: how much of a security was



==================================================
                     PAGE 136                     
==================================================

Part II: Exploring Popular Day-Trading Strategies
demanded at that price. If demand is going up, then more people want the
security, so they are willing to pay more for it. The price tells traders what
the market knows; the volume tells them how many people in the market
know it.
Using Technical Analysis
Technical analysis helps day traders identify changes in the supply and
demand for a security that may lead to profitable price changes ahead. It
gives traders a way to talk about and think about the market so that they
can be more effective.
Most brokerage firm quote systems generate charts, sometimes with the help
of additional software that automatically marks the chart with trendlines.
Technical traders look for those trendlines. Before placing an order to buy
or sell, a trader needs to know whether the security’s price is going up and
whether that trend is going to continue.
One interesting aspect of technical analysis is that the basics hold no matter
what market you’re looking at. Technical analysis can help you monitor
trends in the stock market, the bond market, the commodity market, and
the currency market. Anywhere people try to match their supply and their
demand to make a market, technical analysis can be used to show how well
they’re doing it.
First things first: Should you follow
a trend or deviate from it?
The next sections go into all sorts of detail about how to spot a trend, but the
key thing to understand as a day trader is whether you should follow a trend
or not. Sometimes a trend is good to follow, but sometimes deviating from it
is better.
Remember when you were a kid wanting to do something that all your friends
were doing and your mother would invariably say, “If all your friends jumped
off of a bridge, would you have to jump off, too?”
Well, Mom, guess what? If the bridge were on fire, the escape routes blocked
by angry mobs, and the water just a few feet down, then yes, I just might
jump off the bridge like everyone else. Likewise, if someone were paying us
good money to jump and I knew I wasn’t likely to get hurt on the way down,



==================================================

==================================================

121
Chapter 7: Technical Analysis 101
I’d be over the railing in a flash. Sometimes being a follower is good. But if my
friends were idiots, there were no fire and no angry mob, and I couldn’t swim,
I might not be so hasty to leap.
Trend following is like those mythical childhood friends on that mythical
hometown bridge. Sometimes, you should join the crowd. Other times, devi-
ating is best. When should you follow and when should you deviate? Well,
that depends. You need to know what you’re trading and what the other
people trading that asset are considering when they place their orders.
That’s why a good understanding of what trends are and how they work can
help you.
Finding trends
A technical analyst usually starts off by looking at a chart and drawing lines
that show the overall direction of the price bars for the period in question.
Rather than plot the graph on paper or print out the screen, she probably
uses software to draw the lines. Figure 7-3 shows what this basic analysis
looks like.
With the basic trendlines in place, the trader can start thinking about how
the trends have played out so far and what may happen next.

==================================================

Part II: Exploring Popular Day-Trading Strategies
Drawing trendlines
As shown in the preceding section, the most basic trendline is a line that
shows the general direction of the trend. And that’s a good start, but it
doesn’t tell you all you need to know. The next step is to take out your ruler,
or set your software, to find the trendlines that connect the highs and the
lows. Doing so creates a channel that tells you the support level (the trend-
line for the lows) and the resistance level (the trendline for the highs), as
Figure 7-4 shows. Unless something happens to change the trend, securities
tend to move within the channel, so extending the line into the future can
give you a sense of where the security is likely to trade.
Resistance Line
Figure 7-4:
Drawing
trendlines

channels.
When a security hits its support level, it is usually seen as relatively cheap,
so that’s a good time to buy. When a security hits its resistance level, it is
usually seen as relatively expensive, so that’s a good time to sell. Some day
traders find that simply moving between buying at the support and selling at
the resistance can be a profitable strategy, at least until something happens
that changes those two levels.
Calculating indicators
In addition to drawing lines, technical analysts use their calculators — or have
their software make calculations — to come up with different indicators, num-
bers used to gauge performance. The following sections cover some common
indicators, with definitions.
Pivot points
A pivot point is the average of the high, low, and close price for the day. If the next
day’s price closes above the pivot point, that sets a new support level, and if the
next day’s price is below the pivot point, that sets a new resistance level. Hence,



==================================================
                     PAGE 139                     
==================================================

123
Chapter 7: Technical Analysis 101
calculating pivot points and how they change may indicate new upper and lower
stops for your trading. (Refer to Chapter 2 for more about using stops.)
For markets that are open more or less continuously, such as foreign
exchange, the close price is set arbitrarily. The usual custom in the United
States is to use the price at 4 p.m. Eastern time, which is the closing time for
the New York Stock Exchange.
Moving averages
Looking at all those little high-low-open-close lines on a chart will give your
bifocals a workout. To make the trend easier to spot, traders calculate a
moving average by averaging the closing prices for a given time period.
Some traders prefer to look at the last 5 days; some at the last 60 days.
Every day, the latest price is added, and the oldest price is dropped to make
that day’s calculation. Given the wonders of modern computing technology,
pulling up moving averages for almost any time period you want is easy. The
average for each day is then plotted against the price chart to show how
the trend is changing over time. Figure 7-5 shows an example of a 10-day
moving average chart.
Figure 7-5: A
price chart
showing a
10-day
moving
average.
Traders use the moving average line to look for crossovers, convergences,
and divergences. A crossover occurs whenever the price crosses the moving
average line. Usually, buying is a good idea when the price crosses above the
moving average line, and selling is a good idea when the price crosses below it.
To use convergence and divergence in analysis, the trader looks at moving
averages from different time periods, such as 5 days, 10 days, and 20 days.
Figure 7-6 shows what convergence and divergence look like.

April May June July
When two or three of the moving average lines converge (come together), that
means that the trend may be ending. That often makes it a good time to buy if
the trend has been down and a good time to sell if the trend has been up. If
two or three of the moving average lines split up and diverge, the trend is
likely to continue. That means it’s probably a good time to buy if the trend is
up and sell if the trend is down.
A moving average is a lagging indicator. It sums up trading activity in the last
5, 10, 30, or 60 days, which means that the line smooths out changes in the
trend that may affect future prices, giving you a more accurate picture of the
overall trend over the time period.
Observing trend phases
Price trends tend to move in cycles that can be seen on the charts or observed
in market behavior. Knowing the phases of a trend can help you better evaluate
what’s happening. Here is a summary of some phases of a trend:
✓ Accumulation: This is the first part of the trend, where traders get
excited about a security and its prospects. They start new positions or
add to existing ones.
✓ Main phase (also called continuation): Here, the trend moves along
nicely, with no unusual price action. The highs get higher on an uptrend,
and the lows get lower on a downtrend. A trader may make money —
but not big money — following the trend here.



==================================================
                     PAGE 141                     
==================================================

125
Chapter 7: Technical Analysis 101
✓ Consolidation (also called congestion): This phase indicates a sideways
market. The security stays within the trend but without hitting higher
highs or lower lows. It just stays within the trading range. A consolida-
tion phase is good for scalpers, who make a large volume of trades in
search of very small profits. It can be boring for everyone else.
✓ Retracement (also called correction or pullback): Retracement is a
secondary trend, a short-term pullback away from the main trend to the
support level. Retracements create buying opportunities, but they can
also kill day traders who are following the trend.
✓ Distribution: In the distribution phase, traders don’t think that the
security can go up in price any more. Hence, they tend to sell in large
volume.
✓ Reversal: At this point, the trend changes. It’s time to sell if you’ve been
following an uptrend and buy if you’ve been following a downtrend.
Many reversals follow classic patterns, which are discussed later in this
chapter.
Those ever-changing trends
Although technical traders look to follow trends, they also look for situations
where the trend changes so that they can find new profit opportunities. In
general, day traders are going to follow trends, and swing traders — those
who hold securities for a few days or even weeks — are going to be more
interested in identifying changes that may play out over time.
Monitoring momentum
Following the trend is great, but if the trend is moving quickly, you want to
know so that you can get ahead of it. If the rate of change on the trend is
going up, then rising prices are likely to occur.
To calculate momentum, take today’s closing price for a security, divide that
by the closing price ten days ago, and then multiply the result by 100. This
gives you a momentum indicator. If the price didn’t go anywhere, the momen-
tum indicator is 100. If the price went up, the indicator is greater than 100.
And if the price went down, the indicator is less than 100.
In technical analysis, trends are usually expected to continue, so a security
with a momentum indicator above 100 is expected to keep going up, all else
being equal. But that “all else being equal” is the sticky part. Technical ana-
lysts usually track momentum indicators over time to see whether the posi-
tive momentum is, itself, a trend. In fact, momentum indicators are a good
confirmation of the underlying trend.

==================================================

126
Part II: Exploring Popular Day-Trading Strategies
Momentum is a leading technical indicator. It tells you what is likely to happen
in the future, not what has happened in the past.
Momentum trading is usually done with some attention to the fundamentals.
When key business fundamentals, such as sales or profits, are accelerating at
the same time that the security is going up in price, the momentum is likely
to continue for some time. You can learn more about momentum trading and
investing in Chapter 17.
Finding breakouts
A breakout occurs when a security price passes through and stays
above — or below — the resistance or support line, which creates a new
trend with new support and resistance levels. A one-time breakout may
just be an anomaly (what technicians sometimes call a false breakout),
but pay attention to two or more breakouts. Figure 7-7 shows what
breakouts look like.
Figure 7-7:
A breakout
indicates a
new trend.
When a true breakout occurs, a new trend starts. That means an upward
breakout is accompanied by rising prices, and a downward breakout is
accompanied by falling prices.
False breakouts can wreak havoc for a day to two of trading. With a false
breakout, some traders buy or sell, thinking that the trend will continue. When
they see that it doesn’t, they then turn around and reverse their positions at a

==================================================

127
Chapter 7: Technical Analysis 101
loss. During these times, the ability to size up the intelligence of the other
traders in the market can come in handy.
Good technical analysts look at several different indicators to determine
whether a change in trend is real or just one of those things that goes away
quickly as the old trend resumes. For example, they may look at short inter-
est or overall market volatility. You can learn more about these indicators in
Chapter 8.
Reading the Charts
How long does it take to find the trend? How long does it take for the trend
to play out? When do you act on it? Do you have minutes, hours, or days
to act?
Because markets tend to move in cycles, technical analysts look for pat-
terns in the price charts that give them an indication of how long any
particular trend may last. In this section, I show you some of the common
patterns that day traders look for when they do technical analysis.
Alas, some patterns are obvious only in hindsight, but knowing what the
patterns mean can help you make better forecasts of where a security price
should go.
This section provides just an introduction to some of the better-known
(and cleverly named) patterns. Technical analysts look for many others,
and you really need a book on the subject to understand them all. Check
out the appendix for books that provide more information on technical
analysis so that you can get a feel for how you can apply it to your
trading style.
Wave your pennants and flags
Pennants and flags are chart patterns that show retracements, short-term devi-
ations from the main trend. With a retracement, no breakout occurs from the
support or resistance level, but the security isn’t following the trend, either.
Because there is no breakout, the trend is more short-term.
Figure 7-8 shows a pennant. Notice how the support and resistance lines of
the pennant (which occur within the support and resistance lines of a much
larger trend) converge almost to a point.



==================================================

pennant is that the flag’s support and resistance lines are parallel.
Figure 7-9:

volume.
Pennants and flags are usually found in the middle of the main phase of a
trend, and they seem to last for two weeks before going back to the trendline.
They are almost always accompanied by falling volume. In fact, if the trad-
ing volume isn’t falling, you are probably looking at a reversal — a change in
trend — rather than a retracement.
Not just for the shower: Head
and shoulders
The head and shoulders formation is a series of three peaks within a price
chart. The peaks on the left and right (the shoulders) should be relatively
smaller than the peak in the center (the head). The shoulders connect at



==================================================

a price known as the neckline, and when the right shoulder formation is
reached, the price plunges down.
The head and shoulders is one of the most bearish technical patterns, and
Figure 7-10 shows an example.

down after

formation.
The head and shoulders formation seems to result from traders holding
out for a last high after a security has had a long price run. At some point,
though, the trend changes, because nothing grows forever. And when the
trend changes, the prices fall.
An upside-down head and shoulders sometimes appears at the end of a
downtrend, and it signals that the security is about to increase in price.
Drink from a cup and handle
When a security hits a peak in price and falls, sometimes because of bad
news, it can stay low for a while. But eventually, the bad news works itself
out, the underlying fundamentals improve, and the time comes to buy again.
The technical analyst sees this scenario play out in a cup and handle forma-
tion, and Figure 7-11 shows you what one looks like.
The handle forms as those who bought at the old high and who felt burned
by the decline take their money and get out. But other traders, those who
haven’t the same history with the security, recognize that the price will prob-
ably resume going up now that those old sellers are out of the market.

Figure 7-11:

A cup and

mation is a

trend.
A cup and handle formation generally shows up over a long period of
trading — sometimes as long as a year — and many subtrends occur during
that time. As a day trader, you’ll probably care more about those day-to-day
changes than the underlying trend taking place. Still, if you see that cup
formation and the hint of a handle, you can interpret that as a sign that the
security will probably start to rise in price.
Mind the gap
Gaps are breaks in prices that show up all the time, usually when some news
event takes place between trading sessions that causes an adjustment in
prices and volume. Whether the news is about an acquisition, a product line
disappointment, or a war that broke out overnight, it’s significant enough to
change the trend, and that’s why traders pay attention when they see gaps.
A gap is a break between two bars, as shown in Figure 7-12.
Gaps are usually great signals. A security that gaps up at the open usually
means a strong uptrend is beginning, so it’s time to buy. Likewise, if the
security gaps down, that’s often the start of a downtrend, so it’s better
to sell.
Day traders can get sucked into a gap, a situation known as a gap and crap (or
gap and trap, if you prefer more genteel language). Many traders view the secu-
rity going up in price as a great time to sell, so the day trader who buys on the
gap up immediately gets slammed by all the selling pressure. For that reason,
some day traders prefer to wait at least 30 minutes before trading on an open-
ing gap, while others rely on their knowledge of the buyers and sellers in a
given market to decide what to do.

Grab your pitchforks!
A pitchfork is sometimes called an Andrews pitchfork after Alan Andrews, the
technical analyst who popularized it. This pattern identifies long-run support
and resistance levels for subtrends by creating a channel around the main
trendline. Figure 7-13 shows what a pitchfork looks like.

The upper line shows the resistance level for upward subtrends, and the
lower line shows the support level for lower subtrends. The middle line
forms a support and a resistance line, depending on which side of it trading
takes place. If the price crosses above the midline, it can be expected to go
no higher than the highest line. Likewise, if the price crosses below the mid-
line, it can be expected to go no lower than the lowest line.

Considering Different Approaches
to Technical Analysis
Technical analysts tend to group themselves under different schools of
thought. Each approaches the charts differently and uses them to glean differ-
ent information about how securities prices are likely to perform. In this sec-
tion, I offer an introduction to a few of these approaches. If one strikes your
fancy, you can look in the appendix for resources to help you learn more.
Dow Theory
The Dow Theory was developed by Charles Dow, the founder of The Wall Street
Journal. The theory and the market indexes that are part of it helped sell news-
papers; they also helped people make money in the markets. The Dow Theory
is the basis for the traditional technical analysis described in this chapter.
Dow believed that securities move in trends, that the trends form patterns
that traders can identify, and that those trends remain in place until some
major event takes place that changes them. Further, trends in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average and the Dow Jones Transportation Average can predict
overall market performance.
Not all technicians believe that the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Dow Jones
Transportation Average are primary indicators in the modern economy, but
they rely on the Dow Theory for their analysis, and they still read the Journal.
Fibonacci numbers and the Elliott Wave
Remember back when you had to take standardized tests, you’d often have
to figure the next number in a series? Well, here’s such a test. What’s the next
number in this series? (Hint: This is not a phone number in Chad.)
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21
If you answered 34, you’re right! The series is known as the Fibonacci
numbers, sometimes called the Fibonacci series or just the Fibs. You find this
number by adding together the preceding two numbers in the series, starting
with the first two digits on the number line. 0 + 1 = 1; 1 + 1 = 2; 1 + 2 = 3;
and so on into infinity. Furthermore, when the series gets well into the double
digits, the ratio of one number to the one next to it settles at 0.618, a number
known as the golden ratio, which means that the ratio of the smaller and the

larger of two numbers is the same as the ratio of the larger number to the
sum of the two numbers. In nature, this is the proportion of a perfect spiral,
like that found on a pinecone and a pineapple.
Ralph Elliott was a trader who believed that over the long run the market
moved in waves described by the Fibonacci series. For example, Elliott
believed that a bull market would be characterized by three down waves
and five up waves. He also believed that support and resistance levels would
be found 61.8 percent above lows and below highs. Under the Elliott Wave
system, if a security falls 61.8 percent from a high, it’s a good time to buy.
Elliott believed that these waves ranged from centuries to minutes, so both
traders and investors use the system to identify the market trends that suit
their timeframes. Others — including me — think it’s highly unlikely that the
human activity in the stock market would follow the same natural order as
the ratio of the spiral on a mollusk shell.
Japanese candlestick charting
Candlestick charts were developed by traders in the Japanese rice futures
markets in the 18th century, and they’ve carried through into the present.
The basic charts are similar to the high-low-close-open bars that I talk about
earlier in this chapter, but they are shaped a little differently to carry more
information. Figure 7-14 shows an example of a candlestick.

The length of the rectangle (the so-called candle, also known as the body)
between the open and the close prices gives a sense of how much volatility
the security has, especially relative to the high and low prices above and
below the rectangle (the so-called wick, also known as the shadow). The

shapes and colors create different patterns that traders can use to discern
the direction of future prices. (Most technical-analysis packages color the
candlesticks green on up days and red on down days, to make finding trends
even easier.)
The Gann system
William Gann supposedly made $50 million in the stock and commodities
markets in the first half of the 20th century by using a system that he may or
may not have taught to others before his death. A lot of mystery and mythol-
ogy surrounds the Gann system; some traders rely on what they perceive
to be his method, whereas others dismiss it, in part because Gann relied on
astrology to build his forecasts.
The Gann system, as it is defined nowadays, looks at the relationship between
price and time. If a security moves one point in one day, that’s a 1 × 1 Gann
angle, and that’s normal trading. If a security moves two points in one day,
it is said to create a 2 × 1 Gann angle, which is bullish. An angle of less than
1 × 1 is bearish.
Furthermore, Gann recognized that the market moves back and forth while
in a general upward or downward cycle, but some of those fluctuations are
more positive than others. Just as the system looks for price movements over
time with even proportions (1 × 1, 2 × 1, and so on), it also looks for orderly
retracements. When a security moves back 50 percent, say from a low of $20
to a high of $40 and then back to $30, it would be a good time to buy under
the Gann system.
Many traders swear by the 50 percent retracement guide — even those who
think that Gann is an otherwise crazy system. This may be the origin of one
hoary trading chestnut: Buy whenever a price dips, because it’s likely to be
heading on its way back up.
Avoiding Technical-Analysis Pitfalls
A lot of people make a lot of money selling services to day traders. They pro-
duce videos, organize seminars, and (ahem) write books to tell you how to be
a success. But in the financial world, success is a combination of luck, skill,
and smarts.

Chapter 7: Technical Analysis 101
Before you commit wholeheartedly to any particular school of research and
before you plunk down a lot of money for some “proven” system demon-
strated on an infomercial, think about who are you are and what you are trying
to do. Despite all the books and all the seminars and all the business-school
debates, every form of research has its drawbacks. Keep them in mind as you
develop your day-trading business plan.
If it’s obvious, there’s no opportunity
Many day trading systems work much of the time. For example, a security
gaps up, meaning that, due to positive news or high demand, the price jumps
from one trade to the next (refer to Figure 7-12 for a gap formation). This is
good, and the security is likely to keep going up. So you buy the security,
you make money. Bingo! But here’s the thing: Everyone is looking at that gap,
everyone is assuming that the stock will go up, so everyone buys, and that
bids up the security. The profit opportunity is gone. So maybe you’re better
off going short? Or avoiding the situation entirely? Who knows? And that’s
the problem. Looking for obvious patterns like gaps tells you a lot about what
is happening in the market, but only your own judgment and experience can
tell you what the next move should be.
Overanalyzing the data
Technical analysis is a useful way to gauge market psychology. That’s
what it was designed to do. However, when it was developed, most trad-
ers were human beings, with all their crazy human emotions. Nowadays,
you aren’t trading against a person. In almost all cases, you will be trading
against machines that do what they are programmed to do. They don’t
suffer from doubt, fear, or greed — but you do. The market is an aggrega-
tion of everyone in it, but you don’t want to assign human emotions to
nonhumans.
When trying to determine the mood of the market, you can easily start over-
analyzing and working yourself into a knot. Should you follow the trend or
trade against it? But if everyone trades against it, would you be better off
following it?
Instead of puzzling over what’s really going on, develop a system that you
trust. Do that through backtesting, simulation, and performance analysis.
Chapter 16 has plenty of advice on how to use these techniques. The more
confident you feel in how you should react given a market situation, the
better your trading will be.

Success may be the result of
an upward bias
Under the efficient markets theory, all information is already included in a
security’s price. Until new information comes into the market, the prices
move in a random pattern, so any security is as likely to do as well as any
other. In some markets, like the stock market, this random path has an
upward bias, meaning that as long as the economy is growing, companies
should perform well, too; therefore, the movement is more likely to be
upward than downward, but the magnitude of the movement is random.
If price movements are random, some people are going to win and some are
going to lose, no matter what systems they use to pick securities. If price
movements are random with an upward bias, then more people are going to
win than lose, no matter what systems they use to pick securities. Some of
those who win are going to tout their systems, even though random chance
was really what led to their success.
Technical analysis is a useful way to measure the relative supply and demand
in the market, and that in turn is a way to gauge the psychology of those who
are trading. But it’s not perfect. Before you plunk down a lot of money to learn
a complex trading system or to subscribe to a newsletter offering a can’t-miss
method of trading, ask yourself if the person selling it is smart or just lucky.
A good system gives you discipline and a way to think about the market
relative to your trading style. A bad system costs a lot of money and may
have worked for a brief moment in the past, with no relevance to current
conditions.

help traders cut through the psychology of the market.
In this day and age, most trading takes place via computers. The trading is
often directed by human beings, of course, but the machines are doing the
work. Short-term profit potentials can be very small. As much as they want
to be dispassionate, human traders get sucked into hope, fear, and greed —
the three emotions that ruin people every day. To complicate matters, many
markets, such as options and futures, are zero-sum markets, meaning that
for every win, someone has to lose. Some markets, such as the stock market,
have a positive bias, meaning that winners outnumber losers in the long run,
but that doesn’t mean that’ll be the case today.

Part II: Exploring Popular Day-Trading Strategies
With thin profit potential and so much emotional upheaval, making money
in the long run as a day trader can be tough. This chapter may help. In it, I
cover some common day-trading strategies, and I discuss some of the cold
analysis that goes into figuring out the psychology of the markets.
Psyching Out the Markets
For every buyer, there’s a seller. (There has to be, or no transaction will take
place.) The price changes to reach the point where the buyer is willing to buy
the security and the seller is willing to part with it. This interaction is basic
supply and demand. The financial markets are more efficient at matching
supply and demand than almost any other market in existence. There are no
racks of unsold sweaters at the end of the season, no hot new cars that can’t
be purchased at any price, no long lines to get a table. The prices change to
match the demand, and those who want to pay the price or receive the price
are going to make a trade.
Despite the ruthless capitalistic efficiency underlying trading, the markets
are also dominated by human emotion and psychology. All the buyers and all
the sellers look at the same information, but they reach different conclusions.
There’s a seller out there for every buyer, so the trader looking to buy needs
to know why the seller is willing to make a deal.
Why would someone be on the other side of your trade?
✓ The other trader may have a different time horizon. For example, long-
term investors may sell on bad news that changes a security’s outlook. A
short-term trader may not care about the long-term outlook if the selling
in the morning is overdone, creating an opportunity to buy now and sell
at a higher price in the afternoon.
✓ The other trader may have a different risk profile. A conservative
investor may not want to own shares in a company that’s being acquired
by a high-flying technology company. That investor will sell, and some-
one with more interest in growth will buy. A trading algorithm may place
a trade to manage the risk on another trade.
✓ The other trader may be engaging in wishful thinking, acting out of
fear, or trading from sheer greed. He or she may not be thinking ratio-
nally about what is happening, creating an opportunity for you.
✓ You may be engaging in wishful thinking, acting out of fear, or trading
from sheer greed. You may be the irrational trader, making mistakes that
cost you. Hey, it happens to the best of us sometimes, but the more aware
you are of your emotional tendencies, the better you can trade past them.

==================================================

139
Chapter 8: Following Market Indicators
Don’t try to psych out the trader on the other side. You won’t face the same
traders each time you trade, and more likely than not, the trader you’re facing
is a machine. Worry about yourself instead.
Betting on the buy side
Every market participant has his or her own set of reasons and rationales
for placing an order today. In general, though, although many reasons to sell
exist — to pay taxes, generate cash for college tuition, or meet a pension obli-
gation, among many others — there’s only one reason to buy: You think the
security is going up in price.
For that reason alone, traders often pay more attention to what is happening
to buy orders than to sell orders. To get a sense of who is projecting a profit,
traders look at the number of buy orders coming in, how large they are, and
at what price. I cover volume and price indicators in more detail later in the
chapter.
Because there are so many good reasons to sell but only one good reason to
buy, the market can take a long time to recognize bearish (pessimistic) senti-
ment indicators. Even if you see that prices should start to go down in the
near future, you have to consider that the market today can be very different
from what you see coming up. And as a day trader, you only have today.
Avoiding the projection trap
If you took a peek at some of the technical analysis charts in Chapter 7,
you may have noticed that you can see what you want to see in some price
charts. And if you thought a little about fundamental analysis, you may have
seen that interpreting information the way you want to is just as easy. Instead
of looking objectively at what the market is telling them, some traders see
what they want to see. That’s one reason why knowing your system and using
your limits are so important. Information in Chapters 2 and 16 can help you
with both.
The best traders are able to figure out the psychology of the market almost
by instinct. They can’t necessarily explain what they do — which makes it
hard for those trying to learn from them. But they can tell you this much: If
you can rationally determine why the person on the other side of the trade is
trading, you can be in a better position to make money and avoid the big mis-
takes brought on by hope, fear, and greed.

Taking the Temperature of the Market
For decades, most traders were rooted on the floors of the exchanges. They
had a good sense of the mood of the market because they could pick up the
mood of the people in the pits with them. They often knew their fellow trad-
ers well enough to know how good they were or the needs of the people they
were working for. It made for a clubby atmosphere, despite all the shouting
and arm waving. It wasn’t the most efficient way to trade big volume, but it
allowed traders to read the minds of those around them.
Now, almost all trading is electronic, without the paper and the jackets and
the excitement. Professional traders, who work for brokerage firms or fund
companies, trade electronically, but along long tables (known as trading
desks) where they sit next to colleagues trading similar securities. Even
though everyone is trading off a screen, they share a mood and thus a sense
of what’s happening out there. Some day traders can replicate this camarade-
rie by working for a proprietary trading firm, but most traders work alone at
home, with nothing but the information on their screens to tell them what’s
happening in the market.
Fortunately, ways do exist to figure out what’s happening, even when you’re
just looking at the screen. They include paying attention to price, volume,
and volatility indicators, and you’re in the right place to find out more about
them.
Some traders rely on Internet chat rooms to help them measure market senti-
ment. Doing so can be risky. Some chat rooms have smart people who are
willing to share their perspectives on the market, but many are dominated by
novice traders who have no good information to share or by people who are
trying to manipulate the market in their favor. Check out a chat room carefully
before participating.
Pinpointing with price indicators
In an efficient market, all information about a security is included in its price.
If the price is high and going up, then the fundamentals are doing well. If the
price is low and going lower, then something’s not good. And everything in
between means something else.
The change in a security’s price gives you a first cut of information. Price
changes can be analyzed in other ways to help you know when to buy or
when to sell.

Chapter 8: Following Market Indicators
Momentum
Momentum, which is also discussed in Chapter 7, is the rate at which a secu-
rity’s price is increasing (or decreasing). If momentum is strong and positive,
then the security shows both higher highs and higher lows. People want to
buy the security for whatever reason, and the price reflects that. Likewise,
momentum can be strong and negative. Negative momentum is marked with
lower highs and lower lows. No one seems interested in buying, and that
keeps dragging the price down.
The exact amount of momentum that a security has can be measured with
indicators known as momentum oscillators. A classic momentum oscillator
starts with the moving average, which is the average of the closing prices
for a past time period, say the last ten trading days. Then the change in each
day’s moving average is plotted below the price line. When the oscillator is
positive, traders say that the security is overbought; when it’s negative, they
say that the security is oversold. Figure 8-1 shows a momentum oscillator
plotted below a price line.
Figure 8-1:
A momentum

momentum.
If a momentum oscillator shows that a security is overbought (the line is
above the center line), too many people own it relative to the remaining
demand in the market, and some of them will start selling. Remember, some
of these people have perfectly good reasons for selling that may have nothing

to do with the underlying fundamentals of the security, but they are going to
sell anyway, and that brings the price down. Traders who see that a security
is overbought want to sell in advance of those people.
If a momentum oscillator shows that a security is oversold (the line is below
the center line), the security is probably too cheap. Everyone who wanted to
get out has gotten out, and now it may be a bargain. When the buyers who
see the profit opportunity jump in, the price goes up.
The trend is your friend . . . until the end. Although great reasons exist to
follow price trends, remember that they all end, so you still need to pay atten-
tion to your money management and your stops, no matter how strong a trend
seems to be.
Given that most trends end — or at least zig and zag along the way — some
traders look for securities that fit what they call the 1-2-3-4 criterion. If a security
goes up in price for three consecutive days, then it’s likely to go down on the
fourth day. Likewise, if a security has fallen in price for three days in a row, it’s
likely to be up on day four. Be sure to run some simulations (see Chapter 16)
to see whether this strategy works for a market that interests you.
Trading on the tick
A tick is an upward or downward price change. For some securities, such
as futures contracts, the tick size is defined as part of the contract. For
others, such as stocks, a tick can be anywhere from a penny to infinity
(at least in theory).
You can also calculate the tick indicator for the market as a whole. (In fact,
most quotation systems calculate the market tick for you.) The tick for the
market is the total number of securities in that market that traded up on the
last trade minus the number that traded down on the last trade. If the tick is a
positive number, that’s good: The market as a whole has a lot of buying inter-
est. Although any given security may not do as well, a positive tick shows
that most people in the market have a positive perspective right now.
By contrast, a negative tick shows that most people in the market are watch-
ing prices fall. Sure, some prices are going up, but unhappy people outnum-
ber happy ones (assuming that most people are trading on the long side,
meaning that they make money when prices go up, not down). This shows
that the sentiment is negative in the market right now.
Tracking the trin
Trin is short for trading indicator, and it’s another measure of market senti-
ment based on how many prices have gone up relative to how many have
gone down. Most quotation systems pull up the trin for a given market, but
you can also calculate it on your own. The math looks like this:



==================================================
                     PAGE 159                     
==================================================

143
Chapter 8: Following Market Indicators
advances
declaines
advancevolume
declainevolume
The numerator is based on the tick: the number of securities that went up
divided by (not less) the number that went down. The denominator includes
the volume: the number of shares or contracts that traded for those securi-
ties that went up divided by the number of securities traded for those that
went down in price. This solution tells you just how strongly buyers sup-
ported the securities that were going up and just how much selling pressure
faced those securities that went down.
A trin of less than 1.00 usually means that a lot of buyers are taking securities
up in price, and that’s positive. A trin above 1.00 indicates that the sellers
are acting more strongly, which means a lot of negative sentiment is in the
market.
Volume
The trin indicator looks at price in conjunction with volume. Volume tells
you how much trading is taking place in the market. How excited are people
about the current price? Do they see this as a great opportunity to buy or to
sell? Are they selling fast, to get out now, or are they taking a more leisurely
approach to the market these days? This information is carried in the volume
of the trading, and it’s an important adjunct to the information you see in the
prices. Volume tells you whether enough support exists to maintain price
trends or whether price trends are likely to change soon.
Force index
The force index gives you a sense of the strength of a trend. It starts with
information from prices, namely that if the closing price today is higher than
the closing price yesterday, that’s positive for the security. Conversely, if
today’s closing price is lower than yesterday’s, then the force is generally
negative. Then that price information is combined with volume information.
The more volume that goes with that price change, the stronger that positive
or negative force.
Although many quotation systems calculate force for you, you can do it
yourself, too. For each trading day, run this calculation:
Force index = volume × (today’s moving average –
yesterday’s moving average)
In other words, the force index simply scales the moving average
momentum oscillator (discussed in the earlier section “Pinpointing with

price indicators”) for the amount of volume that accompanies that price
change. That way, the trader has a sense of just how overbought or oversold
the security is on any particular day.
On-balance volume
The on-balance volume is a running total of the amount of trading in a secu-
rity. To calculate the on-balance volume, first look at today’s closing price
relative to yesterday’s and then do one of the following:
✓ If today’s close is higher than yesterday’s: Add today’s volume to
yesterday’s on-balance volume.
✓ If today’s closing price is less than yesterday’s: Subtract today’s
volume from yesterday’s total.
✓ If today’s close is the same as yesterday’s: Don’t do anything! Today’s
balance is the same as yesterday’s.
Many traders track on-balance volume over time, and here’s why: A change in
volume signals a change in demand. The change in demand may not show up
in price right away if enough buyers exist to absorb volume from sellers. But
if still more buyers are out there, then the price is going to go up. Hence, the
volume from even small day-to-day increases in price need to be added up
over time. If the volume keeps going up, then at some point, prices are going
to have to go up to meet the demand.
On the downside, the volume from small price declines add up over time, too.
Over time, this volume may show that very little pent-up interest exists,
indicating that prices could languish for some time.
Many traders look to on-balance volume to gauge the behavior of so-called
smart money, such as pension funds, hedge funds, and mutual fund compa-
nies. Unlike individual investors, these big institutional accounts tend to trade
on fundamentals rather than emotion. They generally start buying a security
at the point where the dumb money is tired of owning it, so their early buying
may show big volume with little price change. But as the institutions keep
buying, the price has to go up to get the smarter individuals and the early
institutions to part with their shares.
Open interest
Open interest has a different meaning in the stock market than in the options
and futures markets, but in both cases, it gives traders useful information
about demand:
✓ In the stock market, open interest is the number of buy orders submit-
ted before the market opens. When the open interest is high, people are
ready to add shares to their positions or initiate new positions, which
means that the stock is likely to go up in price on the demand.



==================================================
                     PAGE 161                     
==================================================

145
Chapter 8: Following Market Indicators
✓ In the options and futures markets, open interest is the number of con-
tracts at the end of every day that have not been exercised, closed out,
or allowed to expire.
Day traders don’t have open interest, because by definition, day traders close
out at the end of every day. But some traders keep open interest, either because
they think that their position has the ability to increase in profitability or
because they’re hedging another transaction and need to keep that options or
futures position in place. If open interest in a contract is increasing, new money
is coming into the market, and prices are likely to continue to go up. This is
especially true if volume is increasing at about the same rate as open interest.
On the other hand, if open interest is falling, people are closing out their posi-
tions because they no longer see a profit potential, and prices are likely to fall.
Volatility, crisis, and opportunity
The volatility of a security is a measure of how much that security tends to go
up or down in a given time period. The more volatile the security, the more
the price fluctuates. Most day traders prefer volatile securities, because they
create more opportunities to make a profit in a short amount of time. But
volatility can make gauging market sentiment tougher. If a security is volatile,
the mood can change quickly. What looked like a profit opportunity at the
market open may be gone by lunchtime — and back again before the close.
Average true range
The average true range is a measure of volatility that’s commonly used in
commodity markets, but some stock traders use it, too. It’s a measure of how
much volatility occurred each day. When averaged over time, this measure
shows how much volatility takes place during the period in question. The
higher the average true range is, the more volatile a security is.
Many quotation systems calculate the average true range automatically, but
if you want to do it yourself, start with finding each day’s true range, which is
the greatest of
✓ The current high less the current low
✓ The absolute value of the current high less the previous close
✓ The absolute value of the current low less the previous close
Calculate those three numbers and then average the highest of them with the
true range for the past 14 days.
Each day’s true range number shows you just how much the security swung
between the high and the low or how much the high or the low that day
varied from the previous day’s close.

Beta
Beta is the covariance (that is, the statistical measure of how much two
variables move together) of a stock relative to the rest of the market. The
number comes from the capital assets pricing model, which is an equation
used in academic circles to model the performance of securities. Traders
don’t use the capital assets pricing model, but they often talk about beta to
evaluate the volatility of stocks and options.
What does beta mean?
✓ A beta of 1.00 means that the security is moving at a faster rate than the
market. You would buy high betas if you think the market is going up but
not if the market is going down.
✓ A beta of less than 1.00 means that the security is moving more slowly
than the market — a good thing if you want less risk than the market.
✓ A beta of exactly 1.00 means that the security is moving at the same rate
as the market.
✓ A negative beta means that the security is moving in the opposite direc-
tion of the market. The easiest way to get a negative beta security is to
short (borrow and then sell) a positive beta security.
The VIX
VIX is short for the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index.
Calculating VIX is complex enough to border on being proprietary, but it’s
available on many quotation systems and on the exchange’s website, www.
cboe.com/micro/vix/introduction.aspx.
The VIX is based on the implied volatility of options on stocks included in
the S&P 500 Index. The greater the volatility, the more uncertainty investors
have; the more options that show great volatility, the more widespread is the
concern about prospects for the financial markets. In fact, the VIX is often
called the fear index and is used to gauge the amount of negative sentiment
investors have. The greater the VIX, the more bearish the outlook for the
market in general. The more bearish the outlook, the more likely the market
is to be volatile. And volatility is the day trader’s best friend.
Traders can use the VIX to help them value options on the market indexes.
(For that matter, traders who want to take a position on market volatility can
use options and futures contracts on the VIX, including a mini-sized future,
offered by the Chicago Board Options Exchange.) The VIX can also be used to
help confirm bullish or bearish sentiment that shows up in other market sig-
nals, such as the tick or the on-balance volume measures described earlier.
The CBOE also calculates a VIX number on a handful of common stocks, if
you are trading those issues or the options on them.

Chapter 8: Following Market Indicators
In addition to the VIX, the exchange also tracks the VXN (volatility on the
NASDAQ 100 Index) and the VXD (volatility on the Dow Jones Industrial
Average).
Volatility ratio
The volatility ratio tells traders what the implied volatility of a security is rela-
tive to the recent historical volatility. This ratio shows whether the security
is expected to be more or less volatile right now than it has been in the past,
and it’s widely used in option markets. The first calculation required is the
implied volatility, which is backed out using the Black-Scholes model, an aca-
demic model for valuing options. When you plug in to the model certain vari-
ables — time until expiration, interest rates, dividends, stock price, and strike
price — the implied volatility is the volatility number that then generates the
current option price. (You don’t have to perform these calculations yourself
because most quotation systems generate implied volatility for you.)
After you have the implied volatility, you can compare it to the historical
volatility of the option, which tells you just how much the price changed over
the last 20 or 90 days. If the implied volatility is greater than the statistical
volatility, the market may be overestimating the uncertainty in the prices,
and the options may be overvalued. If the implied volatility is much less than
the statistical volatility, the market may be underestimating uncertainty, so
the options may be undervalued.
Measuring Money Flows
Money flows tell you how much money is going into or out of a market. They
are another set of indicators telling you where the market sentiment is
right now and where it may be going soon. Money-flow indicators combine
features of price and volume indicators to help traders gauge the market.
Although amounts spent to buy and sell have to match — otherwise, the
market wouldn’t exist — the enthusiasm of the buyers and the anxiousness
of the sellers show up in the volume traded and the direction of the price
change. Just how hard was it for the buyers to get the sellers to part with
their positions? And how hard will it be to get them to part with their posi-
tions tomorrow? That’s the information contained in money-flow indicators.
The most basic money-flow indicator is the change in closing price multiplied
by the number of shares traded. If the closing price was higher than the clos-
ing price yesterday, then the number is positive; if the closing price today
was lower than the price yesterday, then the number is negative. Other indi-
cators out there use midpoint values and don’t go negative; instead, the num-
bers range from higher to lower. Whether positive or negative, a high money
flow indicates strong buying activity, and that indicates that a positive price
trend is likely to continue.

Accumulation/distribution index
In trading terms, accumulation is controlled buying, and distribution is con-
trolled selling. This kind of buying and selling doesn’t lead to big changes in
securities prices, usually because the action was planned. No one accumu-
lates or distributes a security in a state of panic.
But even if the buying and selling activity isn’t driven by madcap rushes in
and out of positions, it’s still important to know whether, on balance, the
buyers or the sellers have the slight predominance in the market, because
that may affect the direction of prices in the near future. For example, if a
security has been in an upward trend but more and more down days occur
with increasing volume, the sellers are starting to dominate the trading, and
the price trend is likely to go down.
To determine the accumulation/distribution index, you use this equation:
accumulation
(close−low)− high−close
= ( )
distribution high−low ×period�svolume
( )
Some traders look at accumulation/distribution from day to day, whereas
others prefer to look at it for a week or even a month’s worth of trading. One
way isn’t inherently better than the other; it depends on what you trade and
how you trade it.
Money-flow ratio and money-flow index
Money flow is closing price multiplied by the number of shares traded. That
basic statistic can be manipulated in strange and wonderful ways to generate
new statistics carrying even more information about whether the markets are
likely to have more buying pressure or more selling pressure in the future.
The first is the money-flow ratio, which is simply the total money flow for
those days where prices were up from the prior day (days with positive
money flow) divided by the total money flow for those days where prices
were down from the prior day (which are the days with negative money
flow). Day traders tend to calculate money-flow ratios for short time periods,
such as a week or ten days, whereas swing traders and investors tend to care
about longer time periods, like a month or even four months of trading.
The money-flow ratio is sometimes converted into the money-flow index,
which can be used as a single indicator or tracked relative to prices for a
given period of time. The equation used to figure out the money-flow index
looks like this:

Chapter 8: Following Market Indicators
100
MFI =100−
1+moneyratio
If the money-flow index is more than 80, the security is usually considered to
be overbought — meaning that the buyers are done buying, and the sellers
will put downward pressure on prices. If the money-flow index is less than 20,
the security is usually considered to be oversold, and the buyers will soon
take over and drive prices up. In between, the money-flow index can help
clarify information from other market indicators.
Short interest ratios
Short selling is a way to make money if a security falls in price. In the options
and futures markets, one simply agrees to sell a contract to someone else. In
the stock and bond markets, short selling is a little more complicated. The
short seller borrows stock or bonds through the brokerage firm and then
sells them. Ideally, the price falls, and then the trader can buy back the stock
or bonds at the lower price to repay the loan. The trader keeps the difference
between the security’s selling price and its repurchasing price. (The process
is described in more detail in Chapter 9.)
People take the short side of a position for only one reason: They think that
prices are going to go down. They may want to hedge against this, or they
may want to make a big profit if it happens. In the stock market in particular,
monitoring the rate of short selling can give clues to investor expectations
and future market direction.
The New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ report the short interest in
stocks listed with them. The data are updated monthly, as it can take a while
for brokerage firms to sort out exactly how many shares have been shorted
and then report that data to the exchanges. The resulting number, the short
interest ratio, tells the number of shares that have been shorted, the percent-
age change from the month before, the average daily trading volume in the
same month, and the number of days of trading at the average volume that
covering the short positions would take.
The loans that enable short selling have to be repaid. If the lender asks for the
securities back or if prices go up so that the position starts to lose money, the
trader is going to have to buy shares to make repayment. The harder it is to
get the right number of shares in the market, the more desperate the trader
will become, and the higher prices will go.
An increase in short interest shows that investors are becoming nervous
about a stock. However, given that short interest is not calculated frequently,

the number would probably not give a trader a lot of information about the
prospects for the company itself. This doesn’t mean short interest doesn’t
carry a lot of useful information for traders. It does. If the short interest is
high, then the security price is likely to go up when all the people who are
short need to buy back stock. Likewise, if short interest is low, there will be
little buying pressure in the near future.
High short interest, along with other bullish indicators, is a sign that prices are
more likely to go up than down in the near future.
Considering Information That Crops Up
during the Trading Day
Technical analysis (described in Chapter 7) and all the indicators discussed
in this chapter offer useful information about what’s happening in the mar-
kets, but there’s one problem: Because so many of those indicators are based
on closing prices and closing volume, they aren’t much use during the trad-
ing day. In fact, many traders read through the information in the morning
before the open to sort out what is likely to happen and what the mood of
the market is likely to be, but then they have to recalibrate their gauge of the
market as information comes to them during the trading day. That informa-
tion doesn’t show up on charts or in neat numerical indicators until the day
ends. Fortunately, several sources of information that are updated while the
market is open can give a trader a sense of what’s happening at any given
time.
Price, time, and sales
The most important information for a trader is the current price of the secu-
rity, how often and in what volume it has been trading, and how much the
price has moved from the last trade. This information is the most basic real-
time info out there, and it’s readily available through a brokerage firm’s
quotation screens.
Chapter 11 discusses the different quotation services that traders can obtain
from their brokerage firms. Although your broker may charge you more to
get more detailed quotes, doing so is worth it for most trading strategies.
Knowing how the price is moving can give you a sense of whether the general
mood of the market is being confirmed or contradicted — information that
can help you place more profitable trades.

Chapter 8: Following Market Indicators
Order book
High-level price-quote data, such as that available through NASDAQ Level 2
or NASDAQ TotalView-ITCH, include information on who is placing orders
and just how large those orders are. (Flip to Chapter 13 to see what such
high-level price-quote data looks like.) The order book gives you key data
because it gives you a sense of how smart the other buyers and sellers are.
Are they day traders just trying not to be killed? Or are they institutions that
have done a lot of research and are under a lot of performance pressure?
Sure, day traders are often very right and institutions are often very wrong,
but the information you see in the order book can help you sense whether
people are trading on information or on emotion.
An additional piece of information from the order book can help you figure
out what’s happening in the market now — namely, the presence of an order
imbalance. An order imbalance means that the number of buyers and sellers
doesn’t match. This situation often occurs during the open because some
traders prefer to place orders before the market opens, whereas others
prefer to wait until after the open. These imbalances tend to be small and
clear up quickly. However, if a major news event takes place or a great deal of
fear exists in the market, large imbalances can occur during the trading day.
These imbalances can be disruptive, and in some cases, the exchange stops
trading until news is disseminated and enough new orders are placed to bal-
ance out the orders.
The order book doesn’t show all the orders. Most brokerage firms maintain
dark pools (also known as dark books or dark liquidity) for large clients or
for their trading desks. Dark pools are collections of orders above or below
market prices that aren’t advertised except in the pool or on electronic com-
munication networks (also known as ECNs, covered in Chapter 3). Traders use
this technique to help buy or sell securities without affecting the price and to
reduce trading costs. The order is executed only if someone matches it inad-
vertently rather than the market price changing to meet the changing supply
and demand. The bad news for a day trader is that these trades can contribute
to market volatility without giving any advance warning.
Quote stuffing
Quote stuffing is the practice of placing a really large number of orders for
a security, often at a price significantly above or below the current market
price. Almost as soon as the orders are placed, they’re cancelled. The trans-
action is completely handled by computerized trading systems, not people.
The people behind the placement of these orders are sometimes referred to
as quote-rate pirates.

Part II: Exploring Popular Day-Trading Strategies
The official idea seems to be to hide customer orders in order to reduce their
effect on the market, especially to keep them hidden from other computer
trading systems, but in practice, these quotes seem to be a way to lead the
market up or down by placing an unusually high or low order out there.
Hence, quote stuffing may be outright market manipulation. In some cases,
it may simply be that the algorithms in the computer programs place wacky
orders for reasons that make sense only to other computer programs. Either
way, these orders contribute to market volatility. That may be just the way it
goes, unless the orders are placed for nefarious purposes.
Regulators aren’t happy with quote stuffing, and it is prohibited — if it’s
caught.
News flows
Although much of the discussion in this chapter is about the information
contained in price, volume, and other trade data, the actual information that
comes from news releases is at least as important.
Much of the news is regularly scheduled and much predicted: corporate earn-
ings, Federal Reserve discount rates, unemployment rates, housing starts,
and the like. When this information comes in, traders want to know how the
actual results compare with what was expected and how this info fits with
the overall bullish or bearish sentiment of the market.
The second type of news is the unscheduled breaking event, such as corpo-
rate takeovers, horrible storms, political assassinations, or other happenings
that were not expected and that take more time for the market to digest.
That’s in part because these events have the ability to change trends rather
than play out against them. In some cases, the markets will halt trading to
allow this information to disseminate; in others, traders have to react quickly
based on what they know now and what they suspect will happen in the near
future.
Many day traders track Twitter and other social-media feeds for informa-
tion during the trading day, and some brokers include these feeds as part of
the services that they offer to their customers. Social media is a permitted
way for companies to disseminate information to the market, but it can also
be spoofed in such a way as to cause headaches. In April of 2013, someone
hacked the Associated Press’s Twitter feed to announce that there were two
explosions in the White House and that President Barack Obama had been
injured. The story was false, but it created a lot of havoc in the markets and
elsewhere before it was retracted.

Chapter 8: Following Market Indicators
What’s the difference between risk and uncertainty? Risk is something that
happens often enough that people can quantify the damage. Uncertainty is
something that may happen, but no one can figure out the likelihood. A fire
that knocks out power to Midtown Manhattan sometime in the next ten years
is a risk; the invasion of the planet by aliens from outer space is uncertainty.
News can happen at any time. It can change a trend and throw all your careful
analysis into disarray. For this reason, careful analysis is no substitute for risk
management. Watch your position sizes and have stops in place so that you
exit when you need to. Chapter 2 has a lot of information on these topics.
Identifying Anomalies and Traps
Traders can be superstitious, and that superstition shows up in different
anomalies and traps that affect the mood of the market even when there is
no logical reason for their existence. You want to be aware of them, because
they can affect trading.
An anomaly is a market condition that occurs regularly but for no good
reason. It can be related to the month of the year, the day of the week, or the
size of the company involved. A trap is a situation where the market doesn’t
perform the way you expect it to given the indicators that you are looking
at. You have a choice: Go with what the market is telling you or go with what
your indicators are telling you.
To a long-term investor, perception is perception. When perception is different
from reality, an opportunity exists to make money. To a short-term trader, per-
ception is reality because it affects what happens before everyone figures out
what’s real.
Bear traps and bull traps
Traders talk about getting caught in traps, which neatly fits the language of
bulls and bears. When they stumble into a trap, they’re stuck moving against
the market, which causes them big trouble. After all, day trading is about
identifying trends and moving with them. You only have a few hours to work
before the time comes to close out. In this section, I list a few common traps
to help you identify and, I hope, avoid them.
The best antidote for a trap is to take your loss and move on to the next trade.

Part II: Exploring Popular Day-Trading Strategies
Chart traps
If you flip back to Chapter 7 and look at some of the sample charts and if you
look at actual price charts created in the market every day, you may notice
that sometimes it’s really hard to tell whether a breakout is false or real and
whether a trend is changing or just playing out with a smaller subtrend. A
ton of subjectivity goes into reading charts, and some days you read them
wrong. You think you’re ahead of the market when you’re actually just trading
against it. Ouch!
Some traders try to work around these types of chart traps by automating
their trading. Several different software packages are available that can scan
the market and identify potential trading opportunities (see Chapter 13 for
more information). But even the best software misreads the market on some
occasions, which is why you need to monitor your positions and make sure
you stick to your loss limits.
Contrarian traps
Way back in Chapter 1, I note that about 80 percent of day traders lose
money. So maybe you’re thinking that the way to make money is to just do
the opposite of what everyone else is doing. But the reason that day traders
lose money isn’t so much that they’re wrong about the trend; it’s because
they’re sloppy in their trading and don’t limit their losses. (That’s why so
much of this book is about the business of trading rather than the actual
mechanics of placing buy and sell orders.)
In a contrarian trap, the trader has made the decision to trade against the
market, and that’s exactly what happens: He or she loses money because
the market is moving in the opposite direction. Taking a contrary position
doesn’t work too well in day trading. In most cases, you have to go with the
flow, not against it, to make money in a single day’s session. The market is
always right in the short term.
A lot of people make money with a contrarian strategy, but they need to pay
attention to avoid the traps.
Calendar effects
Many trading anomalies follow time periods — which is not completely unex-
pected — because many economic and business trends follow the calendar.
Companies report their results quarterly. Most close their books for tax
purposes at the end of the year. Investors are also evaluated quarterly. Retail
sales follow holiday seasons, demand for commodities follows the growing
season, and fuel demand varies with the weather. Whatever you decide to

Chapter 8: Following Market Indicators
trade, you need to do enough fundamental research (the study of the busi-
ness and economic factors that affect the security, described in Chapter 7) so
that you know how your chosen securities move over time.
But some of the calendar effects — the January effect, the Monday effect, and
the October effect — make little logical sense, yet they still influence trading.
The January effect
Many years, the stock market goes up in the early part of January. Why? No
one is entirely sure, but the guess is that people tend to sell at the end of
December for tax reasons and then buy back those securities in January. It
may also be that in the new year everyone is flush with excitement and ready
to see the market go up, so they put money to work and start buying.
If stocks go up in January, then you can get a jump on the market by buying
in December, right? And that would make prices go up in December. To get a
jump on the December rally, you could buy in November. And that’s exactly
what people started to do, and the once-pronounced January effect is now
weak to nonexistent. (People still talk about it, though.) In an efficient market,
people eventually figure out these unexplained phenomena and then trade on
them until they disappear. Use these anomalies as a way to gauge psychology,
not as hard and fast trading rules.
The Monday effect
The market seems to do more poorly on Monday than on the other days of
the week. And no matter what the evidence shows (the research is ambigu-
ous, and the findings vary greatly based on the time period and the markets
examined), many traders believe this to be true, so it has an effect. Why?
There are two thoughts. The first is that people are in a bad mood on Monday
because they have to go back to work after the weekend. The second is that
people spend all weekend analyzing any bad news from the end of the prior
week and then sell as soon as they get back to the office.
The 2008 stock market crash happened on a Monday. Over the previous week-
end, the different regulatory agencies decided to allow the old-line brokerage
firm of Lehman Brothers to fail. The firm failed to open on Monday, September
15, and the rest of the market went into a tailspin.
The October effect
The stock market has had two grand crashes and one smaller but profound
one in October:
✓ October 29, 1929: On this day, known as Black Tuesday, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average declined 12 percent in one day as market speculators



==================================================
                     PAGE 172                     
==================================================

156
Part II: Exploring Popular Day-Trading Strategies
caught up with the less rosy reality of the economy. This crash kicked
off a general decline that contributed to the Great Depression of the
1930s.
✓ October 19, 1987: This day, known as Black Monday, saw the Dow Jones
Industrial Average decline 23 percent. No one is really sure why this
crash happened, but it did.
✓ October 13, 1989: On this day, the Dow Jones declined 7 percent in the last
hour of trading when a leveraged buyout for United Airlines fell through.
Because of these crashes, many traders believe that bad things happen in
October, and they act accordingly. Of course, bad things happen in other
months. The crash in the NASDAQ market that marked the end of the 1990s
tech bubble took place in March 2000, but no one talks about a March effect.
The 2008 crash took place in September; maybe, like the January effect, the
October effect is starting to roll earlier into the year.
Building on Some Standard Strategies
This chapter has a lot of information about different indicators that you can
look at, and this information can be used to form all types of trading strate-
gies. Many traders work out their own systems after they’ve been trading for
a while, but they often start with something standardized.
You can start trading in a lot of ways (many of which you can read about in
this book; Chapter 13 in particular has advice on how to evaluate different
trading systems that you can subscribe to, if you are looking for a system). In
this section, I cover a few basic styles that you can use to launch your trading
business. All the strategies outlined in the following sections are based on the
indicators discussed in this chapter. They include range trading, or working
within normal high and low movements; contrarian trading, or going against the
momentum; news trading, or looking to buy and sell as soon as a juicy tidbit
comes across the newswire; and pairs trading, in which a trader goes long a
strong stock and short a weaker one in the same category. The idea is that in
an up market, gains on the long will outpace losses on the short, and in a down
market, gains on the short will outpace losses on the long.
No one of these strategies is better than another. Each has advantages in
different market conditions. The key is finding a strategy that fits your tem-
perament and style so that you can act on it. A strategy is only as good as the
trader who executes it.
Many brokerage firms offer practice accounts and backtesting services that
you can use to play around and see what fits. And then you can start working
with real money.

Chapter 8: Following Market Indicators
Range trading
Range trading, sometimes called channel trading, starts with an understanding
of the recent trading history of a given security. Getting this history involves
looking at the charts (see Chapter 7) to identify typical highs and lows during
the day as well as the typical difference between these two prices. With
this information, the trader simply buys low and sells high. When the
security dips in price, the order to buy is placed; when it rises, the order
to sell goes in.
Most range traders use stops and limits to keep their trading in line with
what they see. Covered in more detail in Chapter 2, a stop limits the loss if the
security keeps dropping below your entry point, and the limit order gets you
out at a profit if the security moves to the top of the range.
Range trading works in a normal market with just enough volatility to keep the
price wiggling around during the day but not so much that it breaks out of the
range and starts a new trend.
Contrarian trading
Momentum traders buy securities when prices are rising and sell when
prices are falling. These traders figure that something that goes up in price
will continue to go up and something going down will continue to go down.
Momentum trading is one strategy, and it works well for many traders,
especially in a strong bull market.
Contrarian trading, on the other hand, is just the opposite of momentum
trading, and it can work well, too. The logic behind a contrarian strategy is
that nothing goes up forever; for that matter, nothing falls forever, either. The
contrarian trader looks for assets than have been rising in price and sells
them; she prefers to buy things that have been falling. The point is not to
buy cheap or sell dear, but rather to sell what seems to be overpriced and
buy what seems to be a bargain. Contrarian traders may just be quick to spot
when a trend ends. For example, they may buy on a rumor and sell on the
news, jumping out right when everyone else is ready to jump in.
The people I’ve known who use this strategy well tend to be bargain hunters
in every aspect of their lives. They stock up on frozen vegetables when the
grocery store has a once-a-year loss leader, and they sell their apartment if
their neighborhood’s real estate gets too hot. They have a nose for value and
put that to work during the trading day.
Contrarian traders are fighting the trend, and that can work against them
sometimes. This style favors people who know a market inside and out so
that they know when to move against it.

Part II: Exploring Popular Day-Trading Strategies
News trading
News trading is possibly the most traditional form of day trading. This type
of trader doesn’t pay much attention to charts. Instead, he waits for informa-
tion that will drive prices. This information may come in the form of a com-
pany announcement about earnings or new products; a general economic
announcement about interest rates or unemployment; or just a lot of rumors
about what may or may not be happening in a given industry.
Traders who do well with news trading usually have some understanding of
the markets they’re working in. They’re not hard-core fundamental research-
ers, but they know enough to know what kind of news would be taken well
by the markets and what would be taken poorly. They also have the attention
span needed to pay attention to a few different news sources simultaneously,
as well as the ability to place the order when the time comes.
The downside of news trading is that really good events may be few and far
between; more often, the hype is already built into the price by the time you
see it. Also, news trading is difficult to automate, although more and more
computer programs draw signals from news and social-media feeds. You can’t
place a limit order to buy when a price level is hit; you have to wait until you
see the news and then place the order yourself. Thus, news trading works
well only for traders who can commit to placing the order.
Pairs trading
A pairs trader looks for two related assets and goes long on the stronger
one and short on the weaker. Many pairs traders work with stocks and look
for two companies in the same industry, but a pairs strategy can be worked
in futures and currency markets, too — going long on metals and short on
interest-rate futures, for example, or long on the dollar and short on the euro.
The idea is to get the maximum return possible from a trend that affects both
assets. For example, if one retail stock does really well, it may be because the
company is taking market share from a weaker one. These trades are a little
more complex because you have to plan both sides.
Developing a Program
Most modern day traders find that they need to program their trades. By this,
I mean that they need to determine what they are trading, identify the signals
they use to buy and sell securities, and set their trading platform to execute
the orders automatically. Instead of working on your reflexes, you do the
work of planning and testing.

Chapter 8: Following Market Indicators
Of course, a program is only as good as its inputs, and even the biggest of the
big trading firms have had huge losses because of trading glitches.
You don’t need to be a software engineer to develop trading programs. Many
of the charting services offer program templates that you can follow or
adapt; the brokerage firms that work with day traders offer trading platforms
that can be programmed without too much effort, usually by clicking on
icons or inserting widgets of prewritten code.
How do you get started?
✓ If you already know a programming language, look for a broker or
trading platform that uses it.
✓ If you don’t know a programming language, expect to spend a lot of time
and trial and error learning it. The broker probably has online tutori-
als; spend time with them. If you’re stuck on something, ask the bro-
ker’s customer service rep for help and look for additional tutorials on
YouTube.
✓ Write out your process step by step with a pen on paper before you
attempt to convert it to code.
✓ Buy a book or take a class if you need more help.
And if the very idea of programming gives you the heebie-jeebies, consider
another way to make money!

n a certain sense, day trading isn’t risky at all. Day traders close out their
positions overnight to minimize the possibility of something going wrong
while the trader isn’t paying attention. Each trade is based on finding a small
price change in the market over a short period of time, so nothing is likely
to change dramatically. But here’s the thing: Trading this way leads to small
returns. Trading full time is hard to justify if you aren’t making a lot of money
when you do it, no matter how low your risk is.
And some days, there aren’t many good trades to make. You may be looking
for securities to go up, but they don’t. Zero trades lead to zero risk — and
zero return. For this reason, savvy traders think about other ways to make
money on their trades, even when doing so involves taking on more risk. That
risk is what generates the return that many traders crave.
In this chapter, I cover two techniques for finding trades and increasing
returns: short selling and leverage. Both involve borrowing, and both
increase risk.

The Magic of Margin
The dollars you make from trading depend on two things: your percentage
return on your trades and the dollars you have to start out with. If you double
your money but have only a $1,000 account, you’re left with $2,000. If you get
a 10 percent return but have a $1,000,000 account, you make $100,000. Which
would you rather have? (Yes, I know, you’d rather double your money with
the $1,000,000 account. But I didn’t give you that choice, alas.)
The point is that the more money you have to trade, the more dollars you can
generate, even if the return on the trade itself is small. If you have $500,000
and borrow $500,000 more, then your 10 percent return gives you $100,000
to take home, not $50,000. You’ve doubled the dollars returned to you
by doubling the money you used to place the trades, not by doubling the
performance of the trade itself. Clever, huh?
Here are two important things to remember about borrowing, which is known
in trading as leverage:
✓ Leverage gives you more money to trade, which helps you generate
more dollars for your account — or lose more dollars, if you aren’t
careful or have a string of reversals.
✓ When you borrow money or shares of stock, you have to pay it back, no
matter what happens. That’s why borrowing can be risky.
Day traders and other short-term traders aren’t looking to make big money
on any single trade. Instead, the goal is to make small money on a whole
bunch of trades. Unfortunately, all those little trades don’t easily add up to
something big. That’s why many day traders turn to leverage. They either
borrow money or stock from their brokerage firm or they trade securities
that have built-in leverage, such as futures and foreign exchange.
Making margin agreements
Leverage not only adds risk to your own account but also adds risk to the
entire financial system. If everyone borrowed money and then some big
market catastrophe happened, no one would be able to repay their loans, and
the people who lent the money would go bust, too.
As a result, an incredible amount of oversight goes with leverage strategies.
The Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, the different exchanges, and even the U.S. Treasury Department
regulate how much money a trader can borrow. Many brokerage firms have

==================================================

Chapter 9: Increasing Risk and Potential Return with Short Selling
even stricter rules in place as part of their risk management, and they’re
expected to demonstrate to FINRA and the National Futures Association that
they follow their practices.
This extensive oversight means that you have about as much flexibility when
you borrow from your broker to buy and sell securities as you would have
if you borrowed from your friendly neighborhood loan shark to play a high-
stakes poker game. In other words, not much. Margin loans, which are loans
from your broker that increase your buying power, are highly regulated, and
you must meet the broker’s terms. If you fail to repay the loan, your positions
will be sold from underneath you. If you try to borrow too much, you will be
cut off. No amount of begging and pleading will help you.
Your brokerage firm makes you sign a margin agreement, which says that you
understand the risks and limits of your activities. You probably can’t have a
margin account unless you meet a minimum account size, maybe $10,000 or
more, and the amount you can borrow depends on the size of your account.
Generally, a stock or bond account must hold 50 percent of the purchase
price of securities when you borrow the money. The price of those securities
can go down, but if they go down so much that the account ends up holding
only 25 percent of the value of the loan, you get a margin call. (Some brokers
call in loans faster than others; their policies are disclosed in their margin
agreements.)
Brokerage firms handle margin trades all the time. You do the paperwork
once, when you sign a margin agreement. Then each time you place an order,
you’re asked whether you’re making the trade with cash or on margin. Click
the box marked “Margin,” and you’ve just borrowed money. It’s that easy.
Understanding the costs and fees
of margin
Every brokerage firm charges interest on margin. The stated number is
usually an annualized rate; if the rate given is 8 percent, for example, then
you’d owe that much if your loan was outstanding for the entire year.
(Some investors have margin loans in place that long.) A day trader, whose
loan may only be outstanding for a few hours, probably has to pay interest,
too. Some brokerage firms charge by the day; others may charge interest
over three days because it takes three days for a trade to settle.
On top of margin interest, some firms charge a higher commission on margin
trades than for cash trades. They justify this policy with the higher levels of
paperwork and risk management required on margin accounts. Some firms

==================================================

164
Part II: Exploring Popular Day-Trading Strategies
go with the higher commission rather than charge interest on intraday loans.
Your trading life will be easier if you find out your firm’s policies and fees
before you open a margin account.
If you trade derivatives, margin works differently. The contract itself is
leveraged, so you aren’t charged interest. You have to settle your profits
and losses at the end of the day, however (don’t worry; the exchange’s
clearinghouse does it for you). You can’t use the money held as margin for
other trades.
Managing margin calls
If the value of your account starts falling and it looks like it’s falling below
the 25 percent maintenance margin limit, you get a margin call, in which your
broker calls you and asks you to deposit more money in your account. If you
can’t make the necessary deposit, the broker starts selling your securities
to close out the loan. And if you don’t have enough to pay off the loan, the
broker closes your account and puts a lien, which is a claim on your assets,
against you.
Most brokerage firms have risk-management limits in place, so you’ll
probably get plenty of warning before you get a margin call or see your
account closed out. After all, neither you nor your brokerage firm wants
to lose money. Just keep in mind that a margin call is a possibility. If your
account falls to the maintenance level, ask yourself, as objectively as you
can, whether your idea is still good or whether you’re just wishing and
hoping that it is.
At least one brokerage firm advertises that, as a service to you, it will close
out your account as soon as you lose the amount in it in order to keep you
from losing more money. This service helps the brokerage firm as much as it
helps you, because it keeps the firm from dealing with the hassles of chasing
down additional margin. This is one example of the built-in risk management
policies that firms use to limit risks to everyone.
Enjoying margin bargains for day traders
Day traders are often able to avoid margin calls because they borrow money
for such short periods of time. Good day traders look for small market moves
and cut their losses early, which minimizes the risk of using other people’s
money. And by definition, day traders close out their positions every night.

Chapter 9: Increasing Risk and Potential Return with Short Selling
If you qualify as a pattern day trader, you get two benefits. First, your brokerage
firm probably won’t charge you any interest as long as you don’t hold a margin
loan balance overnight. Second, you may be allowed to borrow more than
50 percent of the purchase price of securities. Some firms allow pattern day
traders to borrow 75 percent or more of their trade value.
The Financial Industries Regulatory Association defines a pattern day trader as
one with a margin account holding at least $25,000. This trader must also buy
then sell, or sell short then buy, the same security on the same day four or more
times in five business days. The number of day trades should be more than
6 percent of the customer’s total trading activity for that same five-day period.
The Switch-Up of Short Selling
Traditionally, investors and traders want to buy low and sell high. They buy a
position in a security and then wait for the price to go up. This strategy isn’t a
bad way to make money, especially because, if the country’s economy continues
to grow even a little bit, businesses are going to grow and so are their stocks.
But even in a good economy, some securities go down. The company may
be mismanaged, it may sell a product that’s out of favor, or maybe it’s just
having a string of bad days. For that matter, maybe it went up a little too
much in price, and investors are now coming to their senses. In these situa-
tions, you can’t make money buying low and selling high. Instead, you need a
way to reverse the situation.
The solution? Selling short. In short — hah! — selling short means that you
borrow a security and sell it in hopes of repaying the loan of the shares by
buying back cheaper shares later on.
In trading lingo, when you own something, you are considered to be long.
When you sell it, especially if you do not already own it, you are considered to
be short. You don’t have to be long before you go short.
Selling short
Most brokerage firms make selling short easy. You simply place an order to
sell the stock, and the broker asks whether you’re selling shares that you
own or selling short. After you place the order, the brokerage firm goes about
borrowing shares for you to sell. It loans the shares to your account and
executes the sell order.

Part II: Exploring Popular Day-Trading Strategies
You can’t sell short unless the brokerage firm is able to borrow the shares.
Sometimes so many people have sold a stock short that no shares are left to
borrow. In that case, you have to find another stock or another strategy.
When the shares are sold, you wait until the security goes down in price, and
then you buy the shares in the market at a bargain. You then return these
purchased shares to the broker to pay the loan, and you keep the difference
between where you sold and where you bought — less interest, of course.
The stock exchanges are in the business of helping companies raise money, so
they have rules in place to help maintain an upward bias in the stock market.
These rules can work against the short seller. The key regulation is what’s
called the uptick rule, which means you can only sell a stock short when the
last trade was a move up. You can’t short a stock that’s moving down.
Figure 9-1 shows how short selling works. The trader borrows 400 shares sell-
ing at $25 each and then sells them. If the stock goes down, she can buy back
the shares at the lower price, making a tidy profit. If the stock stays flat, she
loses money because the broker will charge her interest based on the value
of the shares she borrowed. And if the stock price goes up, she not only loses
money on the interest expense but also is out on her investment.
The trader borrows 400 shares of SuperCorp shares to sell. The shares are trading at $25 each. She sells them for $10,000.

The interest and fees that the broker charges traders who borrow stock
accrue to the broker, not to the person who actually owns the stock. In fact,
the stock’s owner will probably never know that his shares were loaned out.
Choosing shorts
Investors — those people who do careful research and expect to be in their
positions for months or even years — look for companies that have inflated
expectations and are possibly fraudulent. Investors who work the short side
of the market spend hours doing careful accounting research, looking for
companies that are likely to go down in price some day.
Day traders don’t care about accounting. They don’t have the time to wait for a
short to work out. Instead, they look for stocks that go down in price for more

Chapter 9: Increasing Risk and Potential Return with Short Selling
mundane reasons, like more sellers than buyers in the next ten minutes. Most
day traders who sell short simply reverse their long strategy. For example,
some day traders like to buy stocks that have gone down for three days in a
row, figuring that they’ll go up on the fourth day. They’ll also short stocks that
have gone up three days in a row, figuring that they’ll go down on the fourth
day. You don’t need a CPA to do that!
Trading strategies are covered in more detail in Chapters 7 and 8, if you are
looking for some ideas.
Losing your shorts?
Shorting stocks carries certain risks because a short sale is a bet on things
going wrong. Because, in theory, there’s no limit on how much a stock can go
up, there’s no limit on how much money a short seller can lose. Two traps
in particular can get a short seller. The first is a short squeeze due to good
news; the second is a concerted effort to hurt traders who are short.
Squeeze my shorts
With a short squeeze, a company that has been popular with a lot of short
sellers has some good news that drives the stock price up. Or, maybe some
other buyers simply drive up the price in order to force the shorts to sell,
which is a common form of market manipulation. When the price goes up,
short sellers lose money, and some may even have margin problems. And the
original reason for going short may be proven to be wrong. Those who are
short start buying the stock back to reduce their losses, but their increased
demand drives the stock price even higher, causing even bigger losses for
people who are still short. Ouch!
Calling back the stock
All is not sweetness and light in the world of short selling. Many market
participants distrust those folks who are doing all the careful research, in
part because they are often right. Company executives are often optimists
who don’t like to hear bad news, and they blame short sellers for all that
is wrong with their stock price. Meanwhile, some short sellers have been
known to get impatient and start spreading ugly rumors if their sale isn’t
making money.
Many companies, brokers, and investors hate short sellers and try tactics to
bust them. Sometimes they issue good news or spread rumors of good news
to create a squeeze. Other times, they collectively ask holders of the stock to
request that their brokerage firm not loan out their shares, which means that
those who shorted the stock have to buy back and return the shares even if
doing so makes no sense.

Leveraging All Kinds of Accounts
Leverage is the use of borrowed money to increase returns. Day traders use
leverage a lot to get bigger returns from relatively small price changes in the
underlying securities. And as long as they consistently close their positions
out at the end of the day, day traders can borrow more money and pay less
interest than people who hold securities for a longer term.
The process of borrowing works differently in different markets. In the stock
and bond markets, it’s straightforward: When you place the order, you just
tell your broker you’re borrowing. In the options and futures markets, the
contracts you buy and sell have leverage built in to them. Although you don’t
borrow money outright, you can control a lot of value in your account for
relatively little money down. The following sections go into more detail on
these points.
In stock and bond markets
Leverage is straightforward for buyers of stocks and bonds: You simply click
the box marked “Margin” when you place your order, and the brokerage firm
loans you money. Then when the security goes up in price, you get a greater
percentage return because you’ve been able to buy more for your money.
Of course, that also increases your potential losses. (For more detail on the
margin process, head to the earlier section “The Magic of Margin.”)
Figure 9-2 shows how leverage works. The trader borrows money to buy 400
shares of SuperCorp. If the stock goes up 4 percent, she makes 8 percent.
Whoo-hooo! But if the stock goes down 4 percent, she still has to repay the
loan at full dollar value, so she ends up losing 8 percent. That’s not so good.
A trader buys $10,000 of SuperCorp with $5,000 of her own cash and a $5,000 loan.
SuperCorp trades at $25/share, so the trader purchases a total of 400 shares. The trader
closes out at the end of the day, so no interest is charged. What happens as the stock
price changes?

Chapter 9: Increasing Risk and Potential Return with Short Selling
If you hold your margin position overnight or longer, you have to start paying
interest, which cuts into your returns or increases your losses.
In options markets
An option gives you the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a stock or
other item at a set price when the contract expires. A call option gives you
the right to buy, so you would buy a call if you think the underlying asset
is going up. A put option gives you the right to sell, so you would buy a put
if you think the underlying asset is going down. (You can read more about
options in Chapter 3.) By trading an option, you get exposure to changes
in the price of the underlying security without actually buying the security
itself. That’s the source of the leverage in the market.
A day trader can use options to get an exposure to price changes in a stock
for a lot less money than buying the stock itself would cost. Suppose a call
option is deeply in the money, meaning that its strike price (the price at which
you would buy the stock if you exercised the option) is far below the cur-
rent stock price. In this event, the obvious thing to do is to set option price
at the difference between the current stock price and the strike price, which
is more or less what happens — more in theory, less in practice. When the
stock price changes, the option price changes by almost exactly the same
amount, enabling you to buy the price performance of the stock at a dis-
count, with the discount being the strike price of the option.
Figure 9-3 shows the performance-boosting leverage from this strategy. The
trader buys call options with an exercise price of $10 on a stock trading at
$25. The option price changes the same amount that the stock price does,
but the call holder gets a greater percentage return than the stockholder.

In futures trading
A futures contract gives you the obligation to buy or sell an underlying finan-
cial or agricultural commodity, assuming you still hold the contract at the
expiration date. That underlying product ranges from the value of treasury
bonds to barrels of oil and heads of cattle, and you’re only putting money
down now when you purchase the contract. You don’t have to come up with
the full amount until the contract comes due — and almost all options and
futures traders close out their trades long before the contract expiration
date. Futures are discussed in Chapter 3, but here I talk about how leverage
works in the futures market.
Although most options and futures contracts settle with cash long before the
due date, contract holders have the right to hold them until the due date and,
in the case of options on common stock and agricultural derivatives, demand
physical delivery. It’s rare, but the commodity exchanges have systems in
place for determining the transport, specifications, and delivery of grain,
cattle, or ethanol. One advantage of day trading is that you close out the same
day, without ever even thinking about the fine print of physical delivery.
Because derivatives have built-in leverage that allows a trader to have big
market exposure for relatively few dollars up front, they’ve become popular
with day traders. Figure 9-4 shows how derivative leverage works. Here, a
trader is buying the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s E-mini S&P 500 futures
contract, which gives her exposure to the performance of the Standard and
Poor’s 500 Index, a standard measure of the stock performance of a diversi-
fied list of 500 large American companies. The futures contract trades at 50
times the value of the index, rounded to the nearest $0.25. The minimum
margin that this trader must put down on the contract is $3,500. Each $0.25
change in the index leads to a $12.50 ($0.25 × 50) change in the value of the
contract, and that $12.50 is added to or subtracted from the $3,500 margin.
A day trader buys a Chicago Mercantile Exchange E-Mini S&P 500 futures contract. The contract price is $50 x the index level.
To buy it, the trader must post margin of $3,500.

Some exchanges use the term margin, and others prefer to use performance
bond. Either term refers to the same thing: money you put in up front to
ensure that you can meet the contract terms when it comes due. If you hold
the contract overnight, your account is adjusted up or down to reflect the
day’s profits. If it gets too low, you’re asked to add more money.

Chapter 9: Increasing Risk and Potential Return with Short Selling
In foreign exchange
The foreign exchange, or forex, market is driven by leverage. Despite the
nervous reports you may hear in the financial news, exchange rates tend to
move slowly, by as little as a tenth or even a hundredth of a penny a day. And
the markets are so huge that hedging risk is easier in the currency markets
than in other financial markets. You may have trouble borrowing shares of
stock that you want to short, but you should have no trouble ever borrowing
yen. To get a big return, forex traders almost always borrow huge amounts
of money.
In the stock market, day traders can borrow up to three times the amount
of cash and securities held in their accounts (although not all firms let you
borrow the statutory maximum), and that amount is set by outside regula-
tory organizations. In the forex market, there is no regulation on lending, and
some forex firms allow traders to borrow as much as 400 times the amount in
their accounts.
Forex firms allow such huge borrowing because they can hedge their risks so
that if you lose money, they make money. If you sell dollars to buy euros, for
example, the firm can easily go in and sell euros to buy dollars. This capabil-
ity makes its position net neutral. If the euro goes down relative to the dollar,
you lose money, but the firm can offset its risk because its counter-trade
went up.
The reason that a forex firm hedges its risks against its day-trading customers
is that most day traders lose money. The firm knows that if it bets against the
aggregate trades held by its customers, it’ll probably come out ahead. Don’t
trade in forex or any other market until you’ve worked out a strategy and prac-
ticed it so that you can avoid becoming a statistic. Chapter 16 has information
on testing and evaluating trading strategies.
Figure 9-5 shows how leverage in foreign exchange makes good returns possi-
ble. Here, the trader starts with a $1,000 account and borrows the maximum
amount the forex firms allow, $400 for each dollar in the account. All $401,000
are put to work buying euros. Note that the euro value stays constant, but
the dollar value of those euros changes by hundredths of a penny. Thanks to
leverage, the return is 11 percent — not bad for a day’s trading! Of course,
you could lose 11 percent, which wouldn’t be so good.
A trader has a $1,000 forex account. He borrows 400 times that amount — $400,000 — to buy euros.

Borrowing in Your Trading Business
Leverage is only part of the borrowing involved in your day-trading business.
Like any business owner, sometimes you need more cash than your business
generates. Other times, you see expansion opportunities that require more
money than you have on hand. In this section, I discuss why and how day
traders can borrow money over and above leveraged trading.
Taking margin loans for cash flow
If day trading is your job, then you face a constant pressure: How do you
cover the costs of living while keeping enough money in the market to trade?
One way to do so is to have another source of income — from savings, a
spouse, or a job that doesn’t overlap with market hours. Other day traders
take money out of their trading account.
If the market hasn’t been cooperative, your account may not have enough
in it to allow you to withdraw funds while still maintaining enough capital
to trade. One option is to arrange a margin loan through a brokerage firm.
With a margin loan, the firm lets you take out a loan against the cash in your
account (or securities that you are holding, not trading). You can spend the
money any way you like, but you’re charged interest and you have to repay it.
Still, a margin loan is a good option to know about because day-trade
earnings tend to be erratic.
Borrowing for trading capital
Some day traders use a double layer of leverage: They borrow the money to
set up their trading accounts and then they borrow money for their trading
strategies. If the market cooperates, this type of borrowing can be a great
way to make money, but if the market doesn’t cooperate, you could end up
owing a lot of people money that you don’t have.
If you want to take the risk, though, you have a few resources to turn to other
than your relatives: You can borrow against your house, use your credit
cards, or find a trading firm that will give you some money to work with.

Chapter 9: Increasing Risk and Potential Return with Short Selling
Borrowing against your house
Yes, you can use a mortgage or a home equity line of credit to get the money
for your day-trading activities. In general, this option carries low interest
rates because your house is your collateral. In most cases, however, the inter-
est isn’t tax deductible (ask your accountant, but generally, you can only
deduct interest used to purchase or improve your house). Still, borrowing
against your house can be a relatively low-cost way to pull value stored in
your house for use in trading.
The risk? If you can’t pay back the loan, you can lose your residence. If you
decide to pursue this strategy, just don’t borrow against your car, too, because
you’ll need a place to live when the bank forecloses.
Putting it on the card
The business world is filled with people who started businesses using credit
cards. And you can do that. If you have good credit, credit card companies
are happy to lend to you.
Naturally, credit card companies charge you a mighty high rate of interest, one
that even the sharpest traders will have trouble covering from their returns.
If the only way you can raise the capital for day trading is through your credit
card, consider waiting a few years and saving your money before taking the
plunge. Because day trading income can be erratic, you may end up using your
credit cards to cover your living expenses some months. You may want to save
your credit for that rather than dedicate it directly for your day trading.
Accepting risk capital from a prop trading firm
Some firms that are in the business of trading are willing to stake new traders.
You may have to go through a training period or pay a fee to rent a desk at their
office or to use their software remotely. The firm watches your trading pat-
terns, including both your profits and your risk management. If the principals
like what they see, they may offer you money to manage along with your own
capital. You will receive a cut of the profits on the funds you trade for them.
The costs of free riding
Some traders figure that they don’t need margin accounts if they buy a secu-
rity in a cash account and then sell it before they have to pay for it. This is
known as free riding, and the SEC doesn’t look kindly upon it. In fact, broker-
age firms are required to freeze a customer’s account for 90 days when they
identify free riding. The customer can then trade only if he or she pays for
each trade as it is made rather than receiving the three days normally allowed.

==================================================

174
Part II: Exploring Popular Day-Trading Strategies
If you’re trading in a cash account, you can avoid a free-riding freezeout by
paying for any securities that you buy within three days, without relying on
money from the sale of those securities to cover the payment. The alternative
is to trade in a margin account.
Assessing Risks and Returns from
Short Selling and Leverage
Leverage introduces risk to your day trading, and that can give you greatly
increased returns. Most day traders use leverage, at least part of the time,
to make their trading activities pay off in cold, hard cash. The challenge is to
use leverage responsibly. Chapter 6 goes into money management in great
detail, but here I cover the two issues most related to leverage: losing your
money and losing your nerve. Understanding those risks can help you deter-
mine how much leverage you should take and how often you can take it.
Losing your money
Losing money is an obvious hazard. Leverage magnifies your returns, but it
also magnifies your risks. Any borrowings have to be repaid regardless. If you
buy or sell a futures or options contract, you are legally obligated to perform,
even if you have lost money. That can be really hard.
Day trading is risky in large part because of the amount of leverage used. If
you don’t feel comfortable with that, you may want to use little or no leverage,
especially when you are new to day trading or when you are starting to work a
new trading strategy.
Losing your nerve
The basic risk and return of your underlying strategy isn’t affected by lever-
age. If you expect that your system will work about 60 percent of the time,
that should hold no matter how much money is at stake or where that money
came from. However, trading with borrowed money likely does make a
difference to you on some subconscious level.
Trading is very much a game of nerves. If you hesitate to make a trade, cut a
loss, or otherwise follow your strategy, you’re going to run into trouble. Say
you’re trading futures and decide that you’ll accept three downticks before
selling and that you’ll look for five upticks before selling. This strategy means

==================================================

175
Chapter 9: Increasing Risk and Potential Return with Short Selling
you’re willing to accept some loss, cut it if it gets out of hand, and then be disci-
plined about taking gains when you get them. It keeps a lid on your losses while
forcing some discipline on your gains. Now, suppose you’re dealing with lots
and lots of leverage. Suddenly, those downticks become too real to you — it’s
money you don’t have. Next thing you know, you only accept two downticks
before closing out. But doing so keeps you from getting winners. Then you
decide to ride with your winners, and suddenly you aren’t taking profits fast
enough, and your positions move against you. Your fear of loss is making you
sloppy. That’s why many traders find it better to borrow less money and stick
to their system rather than borrow the maximum allowed and let that knowl-
edge cloud their judgment. Head to Chapter 14 for more on the mental aspects
of day trading.
Lenders can lose their nerve, too. Your brokerage firm may close your
account because of losses, even though waiting just a little longer may turn
a losing position into a profit. Remember Bear Stearns, the big fancy broker-
age firm that was shut down in March 2008? Or Lehman Brothers, the big
fancy brokerage firm that was shut down in September 2008? Both were shut
down because they had big losses and their lenders would no longer give
them cash.

Looking for Easy Profits: Navigating
the Tricky World of Arbitrage and
High-Frequency Trading
In This Chapter

▶ Considering the costs of your transactions
▶ Checking out tools used to conduct arbitrage
▶ Looking at the various types of arbitrage
D
ay traders work fast, looking to make lots of little profits during a single
day. Arbitrage is a trading strategy that looks to make profits from small
discrepancies in securities prices. The idea is that the arbitrageur, or arb (the
person who does arbitrage), works back and forth among the prices in the
market to reach one final level. In theory, arbitrage is riskless. It’s illogical for
the same asset to trade at different prices, so eventually the two prices must
converge. The person who buys at the lower price and sells at the higher one
makes money with no risk.
Good arbitrageurs have a paradoxical mix of patience (to wait for the right
opportunity) and impatience (to place the trade the instant the opportunity
appears). If you have the fortitude to watch the market or are willing to have
software do it for you (see information on research services in Chapter 13),
you’ll probably find enough good arbitrage opportunities to keep you busy.
True arbitrage involves buying and selling the same security, often with high
levels of leverage (borrowing — see Chapter 9) to boost returns. Other trad-
ers follow trading strategies involving similar, but not identical, securities.
These fall under the category of risk arbitrage. Because brokerage firms,

hedge funds, and other institutions have a huge advantage over day traders,
day traders are more likely to rely on risk arbitrage than on other forms.
In this chapter, I cover the terms and strategies that day traders who engage
in arbitrage use, discuss the basics of arbitrage and how a patient trader can
put those to good use, outline the tools you can use to profit from price dif-
ferences among similar securities, and list the many types of arbitrage you
may want to include in your arsenal of trading strategies.
The challenge is that everyone is looking for these easy profits, so there may
not be many of them out there.
Arbitrage and the Law of One Price
The key to success in any investment is buying low and selling high. But
what’s low? And what’s high? Who knows?
In the financial markets, the general assumption is that, at least in the
short run, the market price is the right price. Only investors, those patient,
long-suffering accounting nerds willing to hold investments for years, see
deviations between the market price and the true worth of an investment.
For everyone else, especially day traders, what you see is what you get.
Under the law of one price, the same asset has the same value everywhere.
If markets allow for easy trading — and the financial markets certainly do —
then any price discrepancies are short-lived because traders immediately
step in to buy at the low price and sell at the high price. In the following sec-
tions I explore how market efficiency limits arbitrage opportunities and how
you can step in when the moment is right.
Understanding how arbitrage and
market efficiency interact
The law of one price holds as long as markets are efficient. Market efficiency
is a controversial topic in finance. In academic theory, markets are perfectly
efficient, and arbitrage simply isn’t possible. That makes a lot of sense if you
are testing different assumptions about how the markets would work in a
perfect world. A long-term investor would say that markets are inefficient
in the short run but perfectly efficient in the long run, so they believe that if
they do their research now, the rest of the world will eventually come around,
allowing them to make good money.

==================================================

179
Chapter 10: Navigating the Tricky World of Arbitrage and High-Risk Trading
Traders are in between. The market price and volume are pretty much all the
information they have to go on. The price may be irrational, but that doesn’t
matter today. The only thing a trader wants to know is whether an
opportunity exists to make money given what’s going on right now.
In the academic world, market efficiency comes in three flavors, with no form
allowing for arbitrage:
✓ Strong form: Everything, even inside information known only to
company executives, is reflected in the security’s price.
✓ Semi-strong form: Prices include all public information, so profiting
from insider trading may be possible.
✓ Weak-form: Prices reflect all historical information, so research that
uncovers new trends may be beneficial.
Those efficient-market true believers are convinced that arbitrage is
imaginary because someone would’ve noticed a price difference between
markets already and immediately acted to close it off. But who are those
mysterious someones? They are day traders! Even the most devout efficient
markets adherent would, if pressed, admit that day traders perform a valu-
able service in the name of market efficiency. The 2008 financial crisis and the
2010 flash crash thinned the ranks of the efficient-market true believers.
Those with a less-rigid view of market activity admit that arbitrage opportu-
nities exist but that they are few and far between. A trader who expects to
make money from arbitrage had better pay close attention to the markets to
act quickly when a moment happens.
Finally, people who don’t believe in market efficiency believe that market
prices are usually out of sync with asset values. They do research in hopes of
learning things that other people don’t know. This mindset favors investors
more than traders because it can take time for these price discrepancies to
work themselves out.
Because arbitrage requires traders to work fast, it tends to work best for trad-
ers who are willing and able to automate their trading. If you are comfortable
with programming and relying on software to do your work, arbitrage may be
a great strategy for you. Remember that the big players have an advantage.
Taking advantage of price discrepancies
So how can you as a day trader take advantage of what you know about the
one-price rule? Suppose that what you see in New York is not what you see in

London, or that you notice that futures prices are not tracking movements in
the underlying asset. How about if you see that the stock of every company
except one in an industry has reacted to a news event?
Well, then, you have an opportunity to make money, but you’d better act fast
because other people will probably see the discrepancy, too. What you do is
simple: You sell as much of the high-priced asset in the high-priced market
as you can, borrowing shares if you need to, and then you immediately turn
around and buy the low-priced asset in the low-priced market.
Think of the markets as a scale, and you, the arbitrageur, must bring fairness
to them. When the markets are out of balance, you take from the high-priced
market (the heavier side of the scale) and return it to the low-priced market
(the lighter side) until both even out at a price in between.
If you start with a high price of $8 and a low price of $6 and then buy at $6
and sell at $8, your maximum profit is $2 — with no risk. Until the point
where the two assets balance at $7, you can make a profit on the difference
between them.
Of course, most price differences are on the order of pennies, not dollars, but
if you can find enough of these little pricing errors and trade them in size,
you can make good money.
Sometimes, the price differences are less than a penny, a situation the traders
call subpennying. A day trader really can’t work with that. To see if subpenny-
ing is going on with an asset that you trade, set your price screens to display
four decimal places rather than only two.
Reducing arbitrage opportunities:
High-frequency trading
Most of the large brokerage firms and many large hedge funds have invested
crazy amounts of time and money to develop high-frequency and algorithmic
trading strategies. These strategies use computer programs that control bil-
lions of dollars and make extremely short-term trades — sometimes holding
only for seconds — whenever the programs spot short-term discrepancies in
the market. In some ways, this practice has made the market more efficient,
because these program traders fix prices that are out of whack in no time. But
they have also added to volatility, sometimes due to program glitches and some-
times because the trades go on even when they shouldn’t, because no human is
there to stop them. In fact, many observers of the market microstructure, which
is the underlying trading environment, think that the amount of high-frequency
and algorithmic trading has reduced efficiency. They see evidence that the
larger number of market participants have led to knee-jerk reactions when

different programs malfunction or entire systems fail. The downside for the day
trader is that these programs have eliminated many arbitrage opportunities that
once made up the bread and butter of many a trader’s earnings.
Scalping, the Dangerous Game
The law of one price is all well and good, but prices change constantly during
the day. They go up a little bit, they go down a little bit, and they move every
time an order is placed.
Once upon a time, day traders could profit from these movements. The
process, known as scalping, is not exactly arbitrage. Especially active in
commodities markets, scalpers look to take advantage of changes in a secu-
rity’s bid-ask spread. This spread is the difference between the price that a
broker will buy a security for from those who want to sell it (the bid) and the
price that the broker will charge those who want to buy it (the ask — also
called the offer in some markets).
In normal trading, the bid-ask spread tends to be more or less steady over
time because the usual flow of supply and demand stays in balance. After
all, under market efficiency, everyone has the same information, so their
trading is consistent and allows the broker-dealers to generate a steady
profit. Sometimes, however, the spread is a little wider or narrower than
normal, not because of a change in the information in the market but because
of short-term imbalances in supply and demand.
A basic scalping strategy looks like this:
✓ If the spread between the bid and the ask is wider than usual, the ask
is higher and the bid is lower than it should be. That’s because slightly
more people want to buy than to sell, so the brokers charge the buyers
higher prices. The scalper uses this as a sign to sell.
✓ If the spread between the bid and the ask is narrower than usual, the
ask is lower and the bid is higher than it would normally be. This situ-
ation occurs when sellers slightly outnumber buyers and the broker
wants to find buyers to pick up the slack. The scalper would be in there
buying — and hoping that the selling pressure is short lived.
The scalper has to work quickly to make many small trades. He may buy at
$20.25, sell at $20.50, and buy again at $20.30. He has to have a low trade cost
structure in place (discussed later in this chapter) or else he’ll pay out all his
profits and more to the broker. He also has to be sure that the price changes
aren’t driven by real information, because that makes market prices too vola-
tile to make scalping profitable. Scalping is akin to “picking up nickels in front
of a steamroller,” some traders say, because of the risk of focusing on small
price changes when bigger changes are underway.

Part II: Exploring Popular Day-Trading Strategies
For years, scalping was a common day-trading strategy. It was always tricky
business, given how quickly prices could move within a trend. With the pres-
ence of so many high-frequency traders, scalping has become downright dan-
gerous, if not impossible. High-frequency traders can and will move before you
can. Nowadays, scalping is like picking up pennies as steamrollers come at
you from all sides.
Scalping, as defined here, is perfectly legal. However, the word is also used
to describe some illegal activities, such as promoting a security in public and
then selling it in private. (Another term for this is pump and dump.) If a celeb-
rity goes on his Twitter feed and talks about how great a stock is so that the
price goes up and then he sells the stock the next day when everyone else is
buying, he has committed the crime of scalping.
Those Pesky Transaction Costs
Pure arbitrage works best in a world where trading is free. In reality, trading
costs good money. Sometimes you may notice a price discrepancy that seems
to last forever, but you can’t work it because the profit wouldn’t cover your
costs. And that actually may be true for everyone else out there.
In the real world, trading costs money. Consider all the costs of getting
started: buying equipment, paying for Internet access, learning how to trade.
Add to those costs the costs of doing business that vary with each transac-
tion: commissions, fees, interest, the bid-ask spread, and taxes. You don’t
make a profit on a trade unless it covers those costs.
Even if you work with a broker who charges little or no commission and even
if your broker charges no interest on day trading margin (loans against your
securities account), you can bet that your broker is making money off you.
That broker’s profit is showing up in the spread and the speed of execution,
so arbitrage still has a cost that must be covered, even on a seemingly free
account. Trust me, brokerage firms are in business to make money, whether or
not their customers do.
Add up those trading costs, and you can find yourself in a frustrating situa-
tion: You can see the opportunity staring you in the face, but you can’t take
it. So the opportunity either sits there, taunting you, or it gets picked off by a
trader who has lower costs than you do.
Does that mean you’re out of luck? Not at all. If you know what your costs are,
you can avoid unprofitable opportunities and take advantage of profitable
ones. When determining how much you have to clear, don’t consider your
fixed costs, like your office and your equipment. Those expenses don’t change

with any given trade. (Yes, you have to cover them in the long run to stay in
business, but you can ignore them in the short run.) Instead, figure out how
much money you give to your broker on any given trade, on an order, per
share, or per contract basis. Write that number down on a sticky note and put
it on your monitor so that you remember what you have to clear before you
risk a trade. Then don’t get so fixated on covering your costs that you avoid
exiting trades at the right time.
Risk Arbitrage and Its Tools
In its purest form, arbitrage is riskless because the purchase of an asset in
one market and the sale of the asset in another happen simultaneously —
you just let those profits flow right into your account. This situation does
occur, but not often, and not in a way that lets most day traders compete
with algorithmic traders.
Because so few opportunities for true arbitrage exist, most day traders look-
ing at arbitrage strategies actually practice risk arbitrage. Like true arbitrage,
risk arbitrage attempts to generate profits from price discrepancies, but like
the name implies, risk arbitrage involves taking some risk. Yes, you buy one
security and sell another in risk arbitrage, but it’s not always the same secu-
rity and not always at the same time. For example, a day trader may buy the
stock of an acquisition target and sell the stock of an acquirer in the hopes of
making a profit as the deal nears the closing date.
Risk arbitrage usually involves strategies that unfold over time — possibly
hours, but usually days or weeks. Pursuing these strategies puts you into the
world of swing trading (described in Chapter 2), which carries a different set
of risks than day trading.
In risk arbitrage, a trader is buying and selling similar securities. Much of the
risk draws from the fact that the securities are not identical, so the law of
one price isn’t absolute. Nevertheless, it forms the guiding principle, which
is this: If you have two different ways to buy the same thing, then the prices
of each purchase should be proportional. If the prices aren’t proportional,
there’s an opportunity to make money. And what day trader doesn’t want to
make money?
Return is a function of risk. The more risk you take, the greater the return you
expect to make.
Arbitrageurs use a mix of different assets and techniques to create these dif-
ferent ways of buying the same thing. The following sections describe some
of their favorites.

Arbitrating derivatives
Derivatives are options, futures, and related financial contracts that draw or
derive their value from the value of something else, such as the price of a
stock index or the current cost of corn. Derivatives offer a lower-cost, lower-
obligation method of getting exposure to certain price changes. In the case of
agricultural and energy commodities, derivatives are the only practical way
for a day trader to own them. Because they are so closely tied to the value of
the underlying security, derivatives form a useful, almost-but-not-quite asset
for traders looking for arbitrage situations. A trader may see a price discrep-
ancy between the derivative and the underlying asset, thus noticing a
profitable trading opportunity.
Using a derivative in tandem with its underlying security, traders can con-
struct a range of risk arbitrage trades (and you can read more about them
later in this section). For example, a trader looking to set up arbitrage on a
merger could trade options on the stocks of the buying and selling compa-
nies rather than trading the stocks themselves. The more arbitrage opportu-
nities there are, the greater the likelihood of making a low-risk profit.
Levering with leverage
Leverage is the process of borrowing money to trade in order to increase
potential returns. The more money the trader borrows, the greater the return
on capital that she can earn. Leverage is commonly used by day traders,
because most trades with a one-day time horizon carry low returns unless
they are magnified through borrowing. (Go to Chapter 9 for detailed coverage
of leverage.)
That magic of magnification becomes especially important in arbitrage,
because the price discrepancies between securities tend to be really small.
The primary way to get a bigger return is to borrow money to do it.
Leverage has a downside: Along with improving returns, it increases risk.
Because even risk arbitrage strategies tend to have low risk, the risk associ-
ated with leverage may be acceptable. Just remember that you have to repay
all borrowed money, no matter what happens to prices. Chapter 9 has more
information on that.
Short selling
Short selling (another topic from Chapter 9) creates another set of alterna-
tives for setting up an arbitrage trade — one that’s almost necessary to the
process. Short selling allows a day trader to profit when a security’s price

goes down. The short seller goes to her broker, borrows the security that
she thinks will decline in price, sells it, and then buys it back in the market
later so that she has the shares to repay the loan. In essence, the trader is
selling high (with borrowed money) and buying back low. Assuming she’s
right and the price does indeed fall, she pockets the difference between the
price where she sold the security and the price where she bought it back. Of
course, that difference is her loss if the price goes up instead of down. The
arbitrageur can use this to bet on assets that are likely to go down in price
when another asset goes up.
By adding short selling to the bag of tricks, an arbitrageur can find a lot more
ways to profit from a price discrepancy in the market. New combinations of
cheap and expensive assets — and more ways to trade them — give a day
trader more opportunities to make trades during the day.
Creating synthetic securities
Feeling creative? Well, then, consider creating synthetic securities when look-
ing for arbitrage opportunities. A synthetic security is a combination of assets
that have the same profit-and-loss profile as another asset or group of assets.
For example, a stock is a combination of a short put option, which has value
if the stock goes down in price, and a long call option, which has value if the
stock goes up in price. By thinking up ways to mimic the behavior of an asset
through a synthetic security, a day trader can find more ways for an asset to
be cheaper in one market than in another, leading to more potential arbitrage
opportunities.
A typical arbitrage transaction involving a synthetic security, for example,
involves shorting the real security and then buying a package of derivatives
that match its risk and return. Many of the risk-arbitrage techniques covered
later in this chapter involve the creation of synthetic securities.
Complex arbitrage trading strategies require more testing and simulation
trading (covered in Chapter 16) and may possibly involve losses while you
fine-tune your methods. Be sure you feel comfortable with your trading
method before you commit big time and big dollars to it.
Arbitrage Strategies for Day Traders
You can use the tools of arbitrage — derivatives, leverage, short selling,
synthetic securities — in all sorts of ways to generate potentially profitable
trades, and that’s what this section of the chapter covers. If you decide to
do arbitrage, you may discover a few useful strategies to follow. Beware of

picking too many: The trader who tries to do too much is the trader who will
soon be looking for a new job! Instead, look for an arbitrage strategy that
matches your approach to the market and make it your own.
The varieties of arbitrage transactions are listed here in alphabetical order.
Some are more complex than others, some generate more opportunities than
others, and some work best if you are willing to swing trade (hold for a few
days) rather than day trade (close out all positions at the end of the day).
Keep in mind that this list is not exhaustive; you can find plenty of other
ways to exploit price differences in the market, but some involve more time
than a day trader is willing to commit.
Many arbitrage strategies work best in combination with other strategies,
such as news-driven trading (discussed in Chapter 8). For example, a news
announcement may cause people to pay attention to a company’s stock,
resulting in enough trading activity that day to close a price gap. If you know
about the pricing problem ahead of time, you can swoop in and make the
arbitrage that day.
Other types of arbitrage are certainly out there. Wherever people pay close
attention to the markets and price changes, they find small price differences to
turn into large, low-risk profits. If you think you’ve found an arbitrage strategy
not listed here, by all means, go and test it to see whether it will work for you.
Convertible arbitrage
As part of designing their capital structure, some companies issue convert-
ible bonds (sometimes called a convertible debenture) or convertible preferred
stock. These securities are a cross between stocks and bonds. Like an ordi-
nary bond, convertibles pay regular income to those who hold them (interest
for convertible bonds and dividends for convertible preferred stock), but
they also act a little like stock because the holders have the right to exchange
the convertible security for ordinary common stock.
Here’s an example: A $1,000 convertible bond pays 7.5 percent interest and is
convertible into 25 shares of stock. If the stock is less than $40 per share, the
convertible holder will prefer to cash the interest or dividend checks. If the
company’s stock trades above $40, the convertible holder would make more
money giving up the income in order to get the stock cheap. Because of the
benefit of conversion, the interest rate on a convertible security is usually
below that on a regular corporate bond.



==================================================
                     PAGE 203                     
==================================================

187
Chapter 10: Navigating the Tricky World of Arbitrage and High-Risk Trading
Because a convertible security carries a built-in option to buy the underlying
stock, it generally trades in line with the stock. If the convertible’s price gets
too high or too low, then an arbitrage opportunity presents itself.
Consider this case: A day trader notices that a convertible bond is selling at a
lower price than it should be, given the current level of interest rates and the
price of the company’s common stock. So he buys the convertibles and sells the
common stock short (see Chapter 9 for more on short selling). When the stock’s
price moves back into line, he collects a profit from both sides of the trade.
ETF arbitrage
An exchange-traded fund, or ETF, is a security based on a stock market index.
It may be a recognized index or one that has been invented by the company
that created the ETF to track a particular investment strategy.
ETFs have been designed with a built-in mechanism to keep the price of the
funds in line with the underlying securities. A typical ETF has two classes of
shareholders. The first are authorized participants, which are large trading
firms that agree to buy the securities in the ETF. The authorized participants
then give the securities to the ETF company in exchange for creation units,
which are shares of the fund that the authorized participant can hold, sell
on the open market, or trade back to the ETF company for the shares. The
authorized participant will do whatever had the greatest profit potential,
some built-in arbitrage designed to keep the ETF’s value in line for the second
class of shareholders, the regular ETF traders.
Despite this mechanism, an ETF’s value may swing out of line with the under-
lying index or the underlying fundamentals of the sector that it represents.
When this happens, a trader can look for an arbitrage opportunity between
the ETF and an index future, between two different ETFs, or between an ETF
and a representative stock.
Fixed income and interest-rate arbitrage
Fixed-income securities are bonds, notes, and related securities that give
their owners a regular interest payment. They are popular with conservative
investors, especially retirees, who want to generate a regular income from
the quarterly interest payments. They are considered to be safe, predictable,
long-run investments, but they can fluctuate wildly in the short term, which
makes them attractive to arbitrageurs.



==================================================
                     PAGE 204                     
==================================================

Part II: Exploring Popular Day-Trading Strategies
Interest rates are the price of money, and so they affect the value of many
kinds of securities. Fixed-income securities have a great deal of interest-rate
exposure because they pay out interest. Some stocks have interest-rate
exposure, too. Trading in foreign exchange is an attempt to profit from the
changing price of one currency relative to another, and that’s usually a func-
tion of the difference in interest rates between the two countries. Derivatives
have a regular expiration schedule, so they have some time value, and that’s
measured through interest rates.
With so many different assets affected by changes in interest rates, arbitrageurs
pay attention. With fixed-income arbitrage, the trader breaks out the following:
✓ The time value of money
✓ The level of risk in the economy
✓ The likelihood of repayment
✓ The inflation-rate effects on different securities
If one of the numbers is out of whack, the trader constructs and executes an
arbitrage trade to profit from it.
Buying bonds outright is rarely practical for a day trader. Instead, day traders
looking at fixed-income arbitrage and other interest-rate sensitive strategies
usually rely on interest-rate futures, offered by the CME Group. You can read
more about interest-rate futures in Chapter 3.
How would such a trade work? Think of a day trader monitoring interest
rates on U.S. government securities. He notices that two-year treasury
notes are trading at a lower yield than expected — especially relative to
five-year treasury notes. He sells futures on the two-year treasury notes
and then buys futures on the five-year treasury notes. When the difference
between the two rates falls back where it should be, the futures trade will
turn a profit.
Index arbitrage
Market observers talk a lot about the performance of the S&P 500 Index and
the Dow Jones Industrial Average. These market indexes represent the activ-
ity of the market and are widely published for market observers to follow.
The performance of the index is based on the performance of a group of secu-
rities, ranging from the 3,000 largest companies in the market (the Russell
3,000) to a mere 30 large companies (the Dow Jones Industrial Average).
Sure, an arbitrageur could buy all the stocks, and some hedge funds do just
that. But very few people can afford to pursue that strategy. Instead, they get
exposure to index performance through the many different securities based on



==================================================

==================================================

189
Chapter 10: Navigating the Tricky World of Arbitrage and High-Risk Trading
the indexes. Buy-and-hold mutual fund investors can buy funds that hold all the
same stocks in the same proportion as the index. Those with shorter-term prof-
its in mind can buy exchange-traded funds, which are baskets of stocks listed
on organized exchanges, or they can trade futures and options on the indexes.
Arbitrageurs love the idea of an asset — like an index — that has lots of differ-
ent securities based on its value because it creates lots of opportunities for
mispricing. Unless the index, the futures, the options, and the exchange-traded
funds are all in line, some canny day trader can step in and make some money.
Suppose, for example, that the S&P 500 futures contract is looking mighty cheap
relative to the price of the S&P 500 Index. A trader can short an exchange-traded
fund on the index and then buy futures contracts to profit from the difference.
Merger arbitrage
Every day, companies get bought and sold, and that creates arbitrage oppor-
tunities. In fact, one of the better-known arbitrage strategies out there is
merger arbitrage, in which traders try to profit from the change in stock
prices after a merger has been announced. This kind of trade starts with the
trader looking at the following details in the merger announcement:
✓ The name of the acquiring company
✓ The name of the company being taken over (and no matter what PR
people say, there are no mergers of equals)
✓ The price of the transaction
✓ The currency (cash, stock, debt)
✓ The date the merger is expected to close
Until the date that the merger actually closes, which may be different from
the date in the merger announcement, any and every one of the announced
details can change. The acquiring company may learn new information about
the target company and change its mind. A third company may jump in and
make an offer for more money. The shareholders may agree to support the
deal only if they get cash instead of stock. All that drama creates opportunity,
both for traders looking for one-day opportunities and for those willing to
hold a position until the merger closing date.
Here’s an example. Say that Major Bancorp offers to buy Downtown Bank
for $50 per share in cash. Major Bancorp’s shares will probably fall in price
because its shareholders will be concerned that the merger will be a lot of
trouble. Downtown Bank’s shares will go up in price, but not all the way to
$50, because its shareholders understand the risk that the deal won’t go
through. An arbitrageur would short Major Bancorp and buy Downtown Bank

==================================================

to profit from the concerns. If Overseas Banque decides to step in, the trader
may think it a profitable idea to buy Major Bancorp and short Overseas
Banque. (If another bidder steps in and places a higher offer for Downtown
Bank, then the whole arbitrage unravels — hence, the risk.)
Option arbitrage
Options, discussed in detail in Chapter 3, form the basis of many arbitrage
strategies, especially for those day traders who work the stock market. First,
many different types of options are available, even on the same security.
The two main categories are puts, which bet on the underlying security price
falling, and calls, which bet on the underlying security price rising. Puts and
calls on the same security come in many different strike prices, depending
on where you want to bet the price goes. Some options, known as American
options, can be cashed in at any time between the date of issue and the expi-
ration date, and you can exercise others, known as European options, only at
the expiration date. (To complicate matters, American and European options
can be issued anywhere.) With all those choices, the alert arbitrageur is
bound to notice a few price discrepancies.
Maybe a day trader notices that on a day when a company has a big
announcement, the options exchanges seem to be assuming a slightly higher
price for the stock than where the stock is actually trading. He decides to buy
the underlying stock as well as a put; he also sells a call with the same strike
price and expiration date as the put. This strategy creates a synthetic secu-
rity (refer to the earlier section “Creating synthetic securities”) that has the
same payoff as shorting the security, meaning that the trader has pulled off a
riskless arbitrage transaction. He effectively bought the security cheap in the
stock market and sold it at a higher price in the options market.
Garbitrage
Traders get sloppy when an exciting merger is Companies, a hardware chain with the ticker
announced. If one company in an industry gets symbol LOW, were to be taken over, chances are
taken over, the stock in all the companies in the good that the stock in Loews Corporation — an
industry will go up, often for no good reason. insurance company with the ticker symbol L —

Y
ou can’t day trade without a trading account at a brokerage firm. It’s
that simple. Although every trader needs one, and although the rates
charged are similar, brokerage accounts are not commodities. Not only do
different brokers offer different services, but most brokers also have tiers of
services available for different types of investors and traders. You aren’t just
buying a way to execute a trade but rather a set of services.
Some brokerage services will be worth the money and then some to you. Others
will be inappropriate for your style. To help you get started on your research,
this chapter covers the different types of accounts, with information on their
features and benefits. After all, you want to make a good trade from the start!
Choosing a Brokerage
If you are going to trade, you need a brokerage account. What kind of broker
you need depends on what you plan to trade (head to Chapter 3 for some of
the basics of different types of securities and where they trade):
✓ If you plan to trade stocks, you need a full-service broker that belongs to
NASDAQ, the New York Stock Exchange, and other major exchanges.
✓ If you’d rather trade the stock market through the CME Group’s E-Mini
index futures, or if you’re interested in other types of derivatives, then
you need a futures trading account with a broker holding a seat on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange or other derivatives exchange.
Many day traders pursue two or three strategies, which may require hold-
ing different brokerage accounts. Having multiple brokerage accounts isn’t
unusual. If you are going to trade both grain futures and tech stocks, for
example, you may want one account with a futures brokerage that belongs to

the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and another account with a stock brokerage
that offers fast execution.
The following sections tell you what to look for when choosing a brokerage firm.
Getting proper pricing
All brokerage firms offer price quotes: a summary of the current bid and offer
prices for selling or buying the security in question. But not all these price
quotes are the same. Some are offered in real time, meaning that you see the
prices as soon as your modem can transmit the change to you. Others are
delayed, sometimes by seconds, sometimes by minutes. If you’re buying a
bond with plans to hold it for ten years, the difference in price between now
and 15 minutes ago probably isn’t material. But if you’re looking to day trade in
the bond market, using short-term changes in treasury futures, a delay of even
30 seconds may be the difference between your strategy succeeding or failing.
Almost all day-trading strategies need direct access in order to maximize prof-
itability. Direct-access brokers allow you to see the price quotes in real time
so that you can act on them immediately, and they allow you to work through
different electronic communications networks rather than going through the
firm’s own traders.
To help you with the pricing, some brokers offer access to liquidity pools,
also known as dark pools, dark liquidity, or dark books. These pools are
private execution networks that can sometimes wreak havoc with the market,
but when used properly, they can improve the pricing on a stock trade.
Brokers that participate in these pools may place your order in the liquidity
pool, and then your order will be executed only if a matching trade exists. In
this situation, the trade happens faster and often with better pricing than it
would if it had been executed in the open market.
Unlike those brokerage services aimed at day traders, a traditional retail
brokerage offers customers more research and advice and may even offer to
improve order execution by waiting until market conditions are more favor-
able. That’s fine for investors but not so good for day traders.
In addition to different levels of market access, brokerage firms offer different
types of price quotes with different amounts of detail. Read on for descrip-
tions and pictures to see what you need for your strategy.
Faster, detailed price quotes are valuable to traders, so brokerage firms usu-
ally charge more for them. Don’t skimp on price services at the expense of
your trading profitability.
Level I quotes
Level I quotes give you the current bid and ask, or bid and offer, prices for a
given security. The bid, of course, is the price at which the broker buys the
security from you, and the ask (also called offer in some markets) is the price
at which the broker offers to sell the security to you. A Level I quote also
shows the size of the most recent buy and sell orders.

==================================================

Chapter 11: All About Accounts
Most brokerage firms offer real-time Level I quotes for free, but these numbers
do not have enough detail for day trading.
Level II quotes
Level II quotes not only tell you what the current bid and offer prices are
but also who the market makers are — the brokerage firm traders who are
buying and selling the security — and what size orders they have at different
prices (see Figure 11-1). This information can help you gauge the volatility
and direction of trading in the market, which can help you make more profit-
able trades. Most brokerage firms that specialize in day trading offer Level II
quotes in most markets.

Evaluating types of platform
When you have an account with a brokerage firm, you have a way to get infor-
mation about the markets and place your orders. The conduit is the Internet,
but you need a way to get your orders to it. Some brokerage firms have their
own software that you can use; others allow you to log in through a website.
The following sections detail your options.
Software-based platforms
With a software-based platform, you must download and install the brokerage
firm’s proprietary system onto your computer. When you’re ready to start
your trading day, you connect to the Internet first, launch the software to see
what’s happening, and place your trades. Software systems generally offer
more features and analytical tools than web-based platforms, but you can
only trade on a machine that has the software loaded on it.
Web-based platforms
With a web-based trading platform, you go to the broker’s website and log in
to trade. With these types of platforms, you can trade from any computer that
has Internet access, which is a boon if you travel or work from several different
locations. In exchange, you may give up some of the analytic and backtesting
tools offered through software-based platforms.
Note that web-based platforms may be designed to work on specific web
browsers. Given the importance of having a stable connection and full func-
tionality in a fast-moving market, if the firm recommends using Internet
Explorer, accept that. Don’t cling to a preferred alternative.
What about mobile platforms? Some brokerage firms allow you to get price
quotes and place trades through a mobile phone. This capability may be
useful to some people, especially as a backup system, but relying on it solely
is a bad idea for most day traders. Day trading is a business, and that means
you need some discipline about setting regular hours and working from a
regular workspace. You’ll probably need more information to work a trade
than will fit on your phone’s screen (most day traders work off more than one
full-sized screen, in fact). Finally, you need to take a break from the market to
maintain balance in your life. If you’re making trades at your cousin’s wedding,
you have a problem.
Opening an account
When you open a brokerage account, you must fill out a lot of paperwork to
comply with government and exchange regulations. Basically, these forms
help the firm ensure that you’re suitable for day trading; that you understand

the risks of options, futures, and margin strategies; and that your trading
money did not come from ill-gotten gains. (I explain all the laws behind these
in Chapter 5.)
After you complete and sign the paperwork, you need to transfer funds.
Most brokers require a minimum investment of $25,000 to open a day-trading
account (to meet the FINRA pattern day-trading rules, although some brokers
set lower or higher minimums). Write a check or set up a wire or Internet
transfer from an existing bank, brokerage, or mutual fund account.
Brokers for Day Traders
Following is a list of brokerage firms with services for day traders. It’s
arranged by specialty (stocks and general trading, options and futures,
foreign exchange) and then alphabetically within each category. This list
is not exhaustive. Also keep in mind that every year new firms are formed
and existing firms are acquired or merged away, so be sure to do your
own research. Also, this list does not imply an endorsement of anyone’s
services.
Barron’s (www.barrons.com), the weekly financial newspaper, has a regular
column discussing electronic trading firm issues and concerns, many of
which are of interest to day traders. Each winter Barron’s conducts a
survey of online brokerage firms with updates on the latest features and
rankings based on such criteria as technology, usability, additional features,
customer service, and trading costs. Check it out when you’re ready to
research.
Brokers for stocks and a bit of the rest
Day traders almost always work through online brokerage accounts. Many
firms offering these accounts handle trading in almost all securities. The
firms usually belong to all the exchanges, so you can trade almost anything
anywhere in the world through them. These brokerage accounts often offer a
range of news and charting services to help you plan your trading. In
some cases, their offerings may be overkill; you may find them distracting
and their services unnecessary. Some may not handle your security of
choice well.

Chapter 11: All About Accounts
Brokerage firms don’t make money just on the commission charged per trade.
Other sources of revenue include monthly service charges, fees for real-time
quotes, interest on margin loans to customers, and the spread, which is the dif-
ference between what you pay for a security and what the firm paid to get it.
So don’t let the commission be the critical factor in deciding among brokerage
firms. Think about the services you need and the relative cost to you of different
account offerings.
By the way, the brokerage industry has been consolidating — and not because
of the financial crisis. (Most of these brokers had no involvement with the
mortgage market.) There are huge advantages to being big, including both
the payoff from technology investments and the ability to get good execution
on trades.
Charles Schwab Active Trading
Charles Schwab was one of the first discount retail brokerage firms, and
it now offers just about every financial service one could want: financial
planning, banking, and mutual funds. The Schwab Active Trading account
includes trading demonstrations and education services that are particularly
useful for active stock traders, although the firm has trading and support
capabilities for options and ETFs, too. The platform works directly through
an Internet browser. Schwab participates in different electronic communica-
tions networks and liquidity pools, which may improve execution.

ChoiceTrade
ChoiceTrade offers software-based equity stock and option trading services
to individuals and small trading firms. Customers can opt for a basic platform
or pay a monthly fee for additional charting, analytic, and money-management
services. Traders can opt for direct access trading, which may offer faster exe-
cution for some strategies. Some of ChoiceTrade’s platforms include mobile
trading capabilities, which may be useful as a backup system.

Cobra Trading
Started as a stock brokerage firm, Cobra now offers trading in futures,
options, and foreign exchange. It has a lot of features for short sellers, such
as an “easy to borrow” list that helps identify stocks that can be shorted with
little market disruption. The firm offers different software platforms to suit
different trading styles, as well as a web-based platform.
For more information, go to www.cobratrading.com.
E*TRADE
E*TRADE offers trading in stocks, options, and futures as well as services
for active traders through its web-based trading platform. It also offers a
software-based platform, Power E*TRADE Pro, with direct-access trading and
customization abilities. The company also has market scanners, to help you
spot when a target pattern shows up, and efficient backtesting systems. If you
really want to trade from your phone, E*TRADE has platforms for that. (I still
think it’s a bad idea.)
For more information, go to www.etrade.com.
Fidelity Active Trader Pro
Fidelity started life as a mutual fund company and continues to dominate
that business. It now also offers a wide range of financial services, including
online trading. Fidelity Active Trader Pro is a software-based system with
lots of bells and whistles, including systems for analyzing and testing options
strategies. (A web-based version is available but has less functionality.) To
use Active Trader Pro, you need to place 36 trades over a rolling 12-month
period; placing 120 trades over a year gets you free Level II quote access.
Both levels should be a slice of cake for most day traders.
For more information, go to http://personal.fidelity.com/

Firstrade
Designed for stock traders, Firstrade offers screeners, alerts, and commen-
tary through its web-based trading platform. The education features include
some good advice about taxes, and community features help traders with
ideas. In addition, Firstrade offers its platforms in both traditional and simpli-
fied Chinese, if you’d rather not work in English. (No surprise, Firstrade has a
lot of Chinese-speaking customers.)

trading services, as well as trading in stocks. Traders can use a range of
order types and order-management features to work complicated strategies.

trades, $5 for options. The website has basic educational services, screeners,
and other tools to help people get started.

brokerage firm, and is now TD Ameritrade’s service for active traders. thin-
korswim offers a full range of products, including mutual funds, on web,
software, and mobile platforms. In addition to an auto-execute feature for
subscribers of different trading newsletters, it has a paper-trading feature
that lets you practice your trades before you commit real dollars. It also

tax time.

nities occur. TradeStation’s services are especially popular with traders who
like to develop their own systems and work on their own programs.

Chapter 11: All About Accounts
Brokers for options and futures
To effectively day trade options and futures, you need an account with a
broker that has direct access to the exchanges’ electronic communications
networks. Several of the full-service firms listed in the preceding section
offer that service, as do the brokers listed here, which specialize in these
particular markets.
Infinity Futures
Infinity Futures offers software-based trading in the options, futures, and
foreign exchange markets; it also has trading education services and
access to live brokers who can answer questions. Customers can choose
from several platforms, depending on trading needs. The firm particularly
supports traders working in the stock index futures offered by the CME
Group.
For more information, go to www.infinityfutures.com.
MB Trading
MB Trading handles stocks and foreign exchange as well as derivatives,
but the company is best known for its services for forex traders. The
company seems to add features constantly. The firm has both software and
web platforms, training programs, community features, and customer alert
settings to help you find trades that suit your system. In addition, MB Trading
offers a lot of support for developers who want to build software around its
platform.
For more information, go to www.mbtrading.com.
OptionsHouse
OptionsHouse was founded by a major options-trading firm and has its
offices on the original Chicago Board of Trade trading floor. Between that
pedigree and the company’s name, it’s no surprise that it offers direct access
web-based trading in options and their underlying stocks. Its software tools
are designed to help you identify and analyze profitable opportunities in the
options market. The firm also has online training programs, blogs, and other
information to help you learn more about options and different strategies for
trading them.

optionsXpress
The company optionsXpress is designed for people trading options and
the stocks underlying them. It offers a lot of educational services and live
customer support as well as phone apps, if you’re so inclined. The option-
sXpress platform has changed over the years as the company adds more
services to meet customer demand. One of its nifty features is an automatic
execution service for subscribers of participating research services (you can
find out more about research services in Chapter 13). The company is owned
by Charles Schwab, but its platform is independent — at least as I write this.
For more information, go to www.optionsxpress.com.
TradeMONSTER
TradeMONSTER is designed for options and futures traders, although this
broker handles stock and mutual fund trades as well. The company offers a
suite of tools to help traders do research, develop and test strategies, and
refine them over time. Some of its features are wonderfully practical, like the
ability to rearrange the data windows across multiple screens to suit your
preferences.
For more information, go to www.trademonster.com.
Brokers for foreign exchange
The foreign exchange, or forex, market is the largest trading market in the
world and offers lots of opportunities for day traders to make (or lose)
money. Most forex trades take place between banks, corporations, and
hedge funds directly, without the use of a broker. If you want to trade foreign
currency directly, you need to use a trading firm that is tied in to these
networks. Many of the brokers listed in the preceding sections offer forex.
The following sections list those that do little else.
Gain Capital Group’s FOREX.com
Gain Capital Group deals mostly with institutional investors and money man-
agers, but it makes its platform available to individual day traders through
its FOREX.com site. There, you can download software that lets you analyze
markets and place trades. The company offers a lot of educational programs
and practice accounts for traders interested in foreign exchange; it also has a
mobile application for those who want to trade by phone.

Chapter 12
Equipping to Day Trade
In This Chapter
▶ Choosing your equipment
▶ Finding good mobile trading apps
T
o perform the job of day trader well, you need to commit to the neces-
sary space and the equipment at home. If you skimp on your Internet
connection, for example, it may be unable to handle the data on a big market
day. If you skimp on your PC, it may go down, leaving you scrambling to get it
back up — a rotten position to be in if you have open positions.
In this chapter, I go over the basics of your office setup, discuss the pros and
cons of mobile trading, and give you some advice on finding trading apps —
even if you trade on a big old computer.
Setting Up Your Trading Laboratory
Twenty years ago, you would have had to pay millions of dollars for the
equipment and telecommunications networks that you can now have in your
own home for just a few thousand bucks or so.
You may be thinking, I can do it for free! I have an iPhone, so what else do I
need? Ah, but you need plenty. Remember, successful day traders approach
trading as a professional activity. That means starting with an adequate work
space and dedicated equipment, as the following sections explain.
Where to sit, where to work
First, you need to find an area to work. If you can’t give up an entire room
in your house, find a corner or hallway where you can put a desk and a computer
just for day trading. Going to an area dedicated to day trading will clear your
mind so that you can focus on the work at hand.



==================================================

==================================================

Part III: Necessities and Niceties for Successful Day Trading
You also need a table and a chair. Instead of borrowing a chair from the
dining room, get a good desk chair that swivels and that you can adjust as
necessary while you work. You also need a shelf and a cabinet of some sort
to hold your files and documents.
Want to get more comfort for the dollar in a desk chair? Consider shopping for
used chairs at office-equipment dealers. They may come with a few scuffs but
will probably have more ergonomic settings than chairs at office-supply
superstores.
Although no rule stipulates the proper layout of your equipment, the more
you can see and do without getting up from your chair, the better off you’ll
be. If you find yourself getting sore at the end of the day, investigate ergo-
nomic products such as special keyboards, contoured mice, wrist pads,
and foot rests, all of which are readily available at office-supply stores.
Counting on your computer
You can’t day trade without at least one computer, and you may want two or
three: one to trade from and one for everything else (such as spreadsheets,
e-mail, and instant messaging). Some traders keep a spare computer on hand
in case the trading computer goes down, but many smartphones can be set
up to work as a backup instead. (See the section “The department of
redundancy department: Backing up your systems” later in this chapter.)
Almost every personal computer on the market today has the power to
handle day-trading activities, so you don’t need to sweat over the details.
In general, faster processing speeds are better than slower ones, and more
memory and storage are preferable to less.
What about the manufacturer? Well, you may not want an Apple computer
for day trading, because you may discover that not all the software packages
you need will be Mac-compatible. If you are one of those die-hard Mac heads,
though, be sure to ask brokers and software vendors about compatibility.
Other than that, the manufacturer doesn’t matter much.
Seeing it on the big screen
Do yourself a favor and spend money on a big flat-screen monitor. Prices
have been falling and sizes have been increasing, so you should have no
trouble finding one. Or two! Or three! If you need to look at more than one
window at a time — to see charts and Level II quotes at the same time,



==================================================

Chapter 12: Equipping to Day Trade
for example — consider using two or more monitors hooked to the same
PC. This arrangement gives you a clear view of necessary data. Most traders
work with at least two monitors, often extra-large ones, because the informa-
tion they need is too valuable to be hidden by overlapping windows during a
work session.
Connecting to the Internet
If you’re day trading, hook up to the Internet with as much bandwidth as
possible. Ask around to find out the fastest time in your area. Your Internet
service provider may charge more for faster performance, but most day trad-
ers find the extra cost worth it. If prices are changing quickly, a delay of half a
second can be costly.
You need fast service, but don’t base your strategy on speed. Even if you pay
up for the fastest service in your area, the brokers and hedge funds of the
world will probably have faster service. NYSE Technologies, the data-services
business of exchange-operator NYSE Euronext, allows brokerage and trading
firms to put their servers on the floor of the exchange. This colocation can
reduce trade execution times to fractions of a second, allowing more trades to
be executed in less time than if the server were in, say, midtown Manhattan.
NYSE Euronext colocation isn’t cheap, but if you make thousands of trades a
day, it may be worth it.
As a day trader, you’re playing in a market with traders who pay good money
for the edge they can get from moving their servers closer to the exchange’s
servers. Hence, when choosing your Internet provider, you don’t want to go
with the low bidder.
Also make sure your trading computer is hooked up to the Internet provid-
er’s wire. Wireless routers are less reliable and can slow you down. If other
people in your household want Internet access, consider getting two Internet
lines so that your son downloading videos in the family room doesn’t slow
you down.
A great source of information about the performance of different broadband
Internet providers is Broadband Reports, www.broadbandreports.com.
Staying virus- and hacker-free
Most operating systems have built-in firewall and virus protection that can
handle most likely threats with aplomb. You can also subscribe to different

virus protection services. No matter which way you go, be careful how you
set these up. Some pointers:
✓ Check compatibility. Check with your brokerage firm to make sure that
its system is compatible with the virus protection package you choose;
some are not. (That potential problem increasingly makes the built-in
options more practical.)
✓ Determine whether there’s a trade-off in access speed. Some types of
antivirus software protect your system at the expense of data speed,
which will hurt your trading execution.
If you decide to go naked — operate without a firewall or virus scanner in
order to maintain optimal speed — be sure to have a backup computer at the
ready.
Whether you go with the built-in software or buy an outside package or are
a Mac or a PC, be sure to set automatic downloads, software upgrades, and
background scans to take place after market hours. You don’t want to be
slowed down because of an operating system update.
The department of redundancy department:
Backing up your systems
When you day trade, you are intentionally looking at volatile markets and
fast-moving securities because that’s where you have the most opportunity to
make money in a short time. You may very well be leveraged, either through
the use of borrowed money or by trading securities with built-in leverage,
such as futures. (I have a lot more to say about leverage in Chapter 9.) If
you’re in a position that moves against you and you can’t get out, you’re sunk.
Not being able to get out because the markets are melting down due to some
kind of global catastrophe is bad enough. But suppose you can’t get out
because the batteries in your wireless mouse have died and you can’t find new
ones? What if you spill your drink and short out your keyboard — or your PC?
What if the developer building a McMansion next door accidentally knocks out
your phone line and your DSL service? All these little workaday calamities have
happened to me — and trust me, they’re downright annoying even if you aren’t
trading. If you are trading, they can be ruinous. If you’re serious about making
money as a day trader, build in redundant systems as much as possible:
✓ Have high-speed data service on your smartphone or tablet computer in
case your primary Internet access goes out.
✓ Load your broker’s mobile app on your phone so that you can switch to
it should something odd happen to crash your computer.

Chapter 12: Equipping to Day Trade
✓ Keep extra supplies on hand: extra batteries, extra keyboard, and extra
mouse. You want to be able to react quickly when things go wrong.
(These items are all cheap to keep in inventory, too, because the
computer makers give keyboards and mice away with every new PC.)
✓ Invest in an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) backup for your PC
so that if the power goes down, your computer stays up. The backup
doesn’t have to last for hours, just long enough that you can close out
your positions. You don’t need a backup generator, though — unless you
think that you’d still want to trade after your town was devastated by an
earthquake or a hurricane. (Hey, crisis creates opportunities!)
✓ Finally, back up your computer regularly. You don’t want to lose your
tax records! You can back up online through Mozy (www.mozy.com) or
Carbonite (www.carbonite.com), or you can use an external hard drive
connected to your PC. Most backup systems can be set up to work auto-
matically — but don’t back up during trading hours! It’ll slow you down.
Getting Mobile with the Markets
A growing number of brokerage firms and software developers are coming up
with applications that let you trade from a smartphone or a tablet computer.
At the time I’m writing this, I think these options are a bad idea for most day
traders. Even with 4G service, mobile networks can be slow and drop out,
and you can’t get enough information on a little screen to trade well.
However, technology changes fast, so maybe by the time you’re reading this,
mobile speeds have become as fast as wired ones. This may be especially
true if you live in a rural area without reliable high-speed Internet service.
The different brokerage firms (including those listed in Chapter 11 and
others) are adding new and better mobile capabilities. Some of the things to
look for are signaling and charting capabilities, ease of order entry, and syn-
ching to your desktop information. Also, make sure that the mobile service
handles whatever asset you usually trade. Mobile apps are still relatively new
as far as the trading world goes, and some can handle your strategy better
than others. Still, I remain skeptical that mobile trading is a good idea for
an active day trader. I live in Chicago near Wrigley Field, and cellphone ser-
vice slows to a crawl on game days. Some 40,000 fans all e-mailing pictures
of themselves at the Friendly Confines to their friends takes a toll on cell
towers. Sometimes, my provider slows so much that only emergency service
is available on game days. It’s not a typical problem, to be sure, but it’s also
not something you want to deal with as a trader. Keep that in mind when
you see brokerage-firm commercials that talk about trading at the game.
If you’re a business traveler who gets a great idea on the road and who wants
to place one order to buy and hold, then great! Use your phone. If you are

a swing trader or an investor who trades more than average, using a mobile
device when exit or entry points happen to be great but you are out of the
office may be fine.
If you’re a day trader placing tens or hundreds of orders a day, your muscles
will cramp up from entering orders with a teensy keyboard, and your speed
could slow down when you least want it to. However, a mobile platform
makes a great backup system. If your broker offers phone trading, you can
use it to keep in the market — or close out efficiently — if your trading
system goes down or you can’t get access to it.
Although mobile trading isn’t the best idea for your primary trading, mobile
technology and the different apps that people develop for it can be really
useful. Here are a few great ones to try:
✓ Apps from the exchanges: Traders need good prices. These apps are
published by the different exchanges and give you price quotes and
news direct from the source. I list the biggies here, but apps are also
available for smaller markets like Warsaw and Dhaka.
• CME Group Mobile: This app takes you to the floor of the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. It’s sophisticated, includes market education
modules, and is available for both Android and iPhone. However,
keep in mind that hardly any floor trading takes place at the Merc
anymore.
• NASDAQ Q Folio: The NASDAQ Stock Exchange has always been
popular with stock traders looking for small companies, and this
app gives you access to portfolio prices, watch lists, and real-time
quotes. It’s free for both main smartphone operating systems.
✓ News apps: Apps are a great way to get news and information about
the markets. You can use these to supplement your trading outside
of trading hours — or for additional insight.
• Bloomberg: Bloomberg is the leading news service for traders, and
its news feed is available in app form for both Android and Apple
devices.
• CNBC Real Time for Phones: In the olden days, traders often had a
TV turned to CNBC going in the background. Now, they can turn to
their Apple or Android phones to get real-time NYSE and NASDAQ
quotes along with CNBC news headlines. It’s free.
• Financial Times: The Financial Times is the United Kingdom’s
financial newspaper, and it has great information about business
from a European perspective. That’s especially useful if you trade
currencies. The app is free and gives you access to eight stories
a month. If you want more news, you have to pay to subscribe.

• StockTwits: This service draws a news feed from Twitter and other
social-media sources so that you can get an idea of what people
are talking about, where the trends are forming, and what new
ideas are heating up. The app is free for iPhone and Android users.
✓ Apps for fun: The following apps are all about trading, but they are more
fun than practical. That’s not a bad thing, though, is it?
• The Game of Stocks: This is a free stock-market simulator game
that lets you start with $22,000 in play money, trade based on real
prices in real time, and then see how you do. It’s only available
for Android.
• NYSE Euronext Options Quiz: This app is a good way to learn
about options. The quiz app lets you test what you know and earn
prizes — virtual prizes, but prizes nonetheless — as you progress.
• Pirates and Traders: Okay, this isn’t a day trading app, but it’s
a fun game for the Android system that lets you choose to be a
pirate of the high seas or the captain of a trading ship, and you can
then try to make money in your chosen role. If you’re thinking of
day trading because you’re bored, you may want to try
this instead.
• Trading Wisdom: This fun, free app gives you great quotes and
advice about trading. It was developed by Sriram Swaminathan
and is available for Android.

Chapter 13
Researching Research Services
In This Chapter
▶ Figuring out where to get a trading education
▶ Supplementing your trading with research
▶ Checking out vendors before you spend your money
A
lot of people make big money in day trading, but they aren’t day traders.
They’re the people who have profitable businesses selling training
services, software, newsletters, and coaching. The problem is, their lessons
don’t often help their customers make a profit after these education costs are
figured in.
Why the discrepancy between the cost of the training and the value it gener-
ates for day traders? It could very well be because some traders who buy
these services aren’t cut out for day trading in the first place; after all, day
trading isn’t for everyone. In other cases, though, the traders fail to do good
research before plunking down the cold cash for training in a system that just
wasn’t very good.
You’ve already plunked down the price of this book. Consider that an invest-
ment! In this chapter, I cover some of the different services that day traders
may want to buy and give you advice on how to determine which ones are
worthwhile and which are not.
The Trade of Trading
Day trading is a career. Every career takes time to master, and practitioners
have to work to keep their skills up as the field changes. You’ll probably find
that you need some training to get started and more training to be success-
ful, whether you’re trading futures, building bridges, or doing heart surgery.
The following sections outline some of the training options available to you.

Part III: Necessities and Niceties for Successful Day Trading
Let me be frank: Although I put a lot of information in this book about day
trading, I don’t include everything. This book is a starting point. The fact is,
because you can trade so many different assets in so many ways, no one
resource can give you all the information you need. A stock trader following a
news-based momentum strategy needs different services than a forex trader
looking at interest-rate discrepancies. That’s why my goal is not to teach you
about specifics but to point you to resources that can help you get started
and show you how to get the most value from the money you spend.
Enjoying freebies from the exchanges
and the regulators
Before you spend more money, check out what several different exchanges and
self-regulatory organizations offer for free to help you get started in trading.
Through these sources, you can find webinars, online courses, and plenty of
reading material that may give you all the information you need to get started.
After all, the financial industry wants people to trade — that’s how it makes
money — and it wants them to be successful, because that keeps the market
functioning. (Exchanges are businesses, like any other.) Going through such
free material first can give you a great sense of how suitable you are for a given
strategy and help you make better decisions about other types of training.
In this section I list a few resources that are particularly good for new
day traders.
Chicago Board Options Exchange Learning Center
The Options Institute of the Chicago Board Options Exchange offers a series
of great online tutorials, classes, practice accounts, and seminars that cover
exchange-traded options in great depth. Many are free, although some of the
more intensive programs that include live coaching carry tuition charges. The
CBOE also has a two-day seminar for experienced traders who want to come to
Chicago (a great city, although the weather is something else). The site includes
online toolboxes and calculators, not to mention a simulated trading game.
For more information, go to www.cboe.com/LearnCenter/default.aspx.
CME Group Education
The CME Group, a holding company for several different exchanges, offers
extensive and detailed free education programs on just about every aspect
of derivatives trading. Whether your interest is currency, grain, or options on
futures, the CME Group has videos, online courses, and white papers covering
basic vocabulary, advanced trading strategies, and current market commentary.

Chapter 13: Researching Research Services
It has a lot of information that you can use, whatever your strategy. And you
really can’t beat the price!
For more information, go to www.cmegroup.com/education/index.html.
Institute for Financial Markets
The Institute for Financial Markets is a nonprofit organization that provides
basic training programs for people working on the options and futures
exchanges. Many of its courses are inappropriate for day traders, who aren’t
going to be licensed and who do not have mandatory continuing education
requirements to maintain those licenses. But some of the options may be
helpful to you, so check them out after you see what the exchanges have to
offer. Recent offerings include the basics of derivatives and trading strategies.
For more information, go to www.theifm.org.
IntercontinentalExchange
Most of the training programs offered by the IntercontinentalExchange are
designed for employees of trading firms and take place at the exchange’s
offices, but they have offices all over the world. The ICE also has several
online seminars that can help you learn more about different products and
strategies. These seminars are aimed at traders with a little experience.
For more information, go to www.theice.com/KnowledgeCenter.shtml.
NASDAQ/OMX
Okay, if I’m being honest here, I have to admit that the stock exchanges want
to promote investing more than trading, because they want companies to
issue stock on their exchanges. The kind of high volatility that day traders
love puts off some starchy corporate officers. Hence, much of the information
on NASDAQ’s site is about how to select stocks for the long term. Still, some
information here may be useful to a prospective day trader, including data
descriptions that can help you with your strategies.
For more information, go to www.nasdaq.com/investing.
National Futures Association Investor Learning Center
The National Futures Association is the self-regulatory organization for the
agricultural and financial futures exchanges. This site includes tutorials on
trading futures and foreign exchange. This organization doesn’t have a lot of
tutorials, but those it does have are free and comprehensive.
For more information, go to www.nfa.futures.org/investor/
investorLearningCenter.asp.

New York Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange, like NASDAQ, wants to court investors rather
than traders. Still, the exchange’s site has information on trading stocks,
bonds, and exchange-traded funds that can make you smarter on those
topics without spending a dime.
For more information, go to https://nyse.nyx.com/financial-literacy.
Hitting the road for conferences
Although day trading is a deskbound pursuit, you may want to get out into
the world to learn more about trading and research different companies with
products for day traders. Many of the exchanges and larger day-trading bro-
kerage firms have their own seminars and conferences, but a few are open to
the public. There is great information to be had, but watch out: The game is
sometimes to sell you more than inform you.
Brokerage firms offering many seminars and training programs may have
higher commissions than firms offering less service, but the additional
expense may be worth it, especially as you’re getting started. You can find out
more about brokerage firms that work with day traders in Chapter 11.
The Money Show
The Money Show is a series of investment conferences held in different major
cities around the country. Some focus on specific topics, such as trading and
foreign exchange, while others run the gamut. Registration is free, which means
that when you show up people will try to sell you stuff. Although these vendors
can be distracting to an established trader, they can be helpful to new traders
looking to find out more about all the different software and services available.
Just make sure you’re getting information, not an opportunity to spend even
more money. These conferences also have high-profile speakers, so you can
learn from Wall Street celebrities. The Money Show website includes articles,
podcasts, and free online courses to help you learn more about trading.
For more information, go to www.moneyshow.com.
Trading Forum
The Trading Forum is sponsored by Traders’ Library, which sells research
materials and investing books. The conference isn’t cheap, but it covers spe-
cific trading strategies and information. It also offers a good introduction to
trading. Although a bit pricey, the information is worth the money, especially
if the conference happens to be close to where you live.
For more information, go to www.traderslibrary.com/conferences.

Chapter 13: Researching Research Services
Taking training classes
Although not necessary, many day traders learn the game by enrolling in a
training program, ranging from a graduate-level certificate program offered
by Northwestern University to DVDs hawked on late-night infomercials.
No program can guarantee success, nor is any one program right for every
trader. I list a few bigger and better-known programs here, but check them
out to make sure they’re right for you — just as you would check out
programs that aren’t listed here.
The larger brokerage and research firms offer their own training courses, often
at little or no cost. Consider those as a first option, but keep in mind that their
introductory sessions may be sales pitches for more products and services.
Of course, other training programs may be disguised sales pitches, too. At
some point, you’re better off trading than training. The markets will school
you better than any webinar.
Plenty of great and legitimate training firms are out there — as well as a lot of
scammers. Run from anyone who guarantees your success, and don’t sign up
for a training program until you know what you need to learn. I include some
information about due diligence at the end of this chapter.
FX:1 Academy
FX:1 Academy offers in-person training courses in foreign exchange. The bad
news is that the courses take place in Asia, mostly in Singapore, which can
be an issue if you live in the United States. But if you’re interested in trading
currencies and find yourself in Asia, you may want to investigate its courses.
For more information, go to www.fx1academy.com.
Kapitall
Kapitall is a brokerage firm, but I list it here instead of with the brokers
in Chapter 11 because its services aren’t designed for active day traders.
However, it has services to help people learn about investing that may also
help you learn about trading, including games and competitions. Many of
these are free. If you’re interested in learning more about the stock market,
check it out.
For more information, go to www.kapitall.com.
Pristine
Pristine has a range of books and DVDs, online and in person classes, and
coaching services in English and Spanish, covering trading skills that work
in most markets. Its courses operate at different levels, with some requiring
extensive trading experience using specific software packages.
For more information, go to www.pristine.com.

TopstepTrader
TopstepTrader was founded by a veteran of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
to address the way people learn to trade in electronic markets. (The old
method, of working as a runner on the floor of the exchange, no longer works
now that the floors are disappearing.) It starts with two weeks of free prac-
tice trading. (It also offers paid trading courses.) If you do well enough in
the practice account, you can enter its trading combine, which is designed
to mimic the National Football League combine: You pay a deposit, which is
refunded if your trading adheres to certain risk and other parameters; you
receive research and coaching from experienced traders; and your perfor-
mance is evaluated. If the coaches like what they see, you may be funded
to trade for TopstepTrader’s parent firm, Patak Trading, or you may be
recruited by another firm.
For more information, go to www.topsteptrader.com.
Trading Advantage
Trading Advantage, run by an experienced commodities floor trader, has a
ton of training options, ranging from telephone coaching and a virtual trading
room to books and DVDs. Some of the company’s programs are designed for
floor traders at the exchanges who need to learn to trade futures electroni-
cally in order to stay competitive, while others work for an average person
who wants to get started or who wants to improve his or her trading
prowess.
For more information, go to www.tradingadvantage.com.
Trader Kingdom
Run by a group of experienced traders, Trader Kingdom offers webinars, live
speakers, and coaching services, as well as a lot of free online educational
material on futures trading. If you’re considering futures markets, check out
the website to see the firm’s current offerings.
For more information, go to www.traderkingdom.com.
TradingSchool.com
TradingSchool.com, based in Los Angeles, has a series of online and in-person
classes covering trading psychology as well as trading in stocks, options,
financial futures, and currencies. The firm works with day traders as well as
money managers and other long-term investors.
For more information, go to www.tradingschool.com.

The University of Trading
The University of Trading offers courses in options, equities, foreign
exchange, and financial and agricultural commodities online and at its offices
in Chicago. Students can hear lectures on different aspects of the markets
and have the opportunity to trade alongside experienced instructors. The
company trains professional traders, some of whom trade for themselves and
some of whom take jobs with others.
For more information, go to www.universityoftrading.com.
Getting the Research You Need
Day traders need a trading system, and they often rely on subscription
research services. That’s fine, as long as those systems are adding value over
and above their cost. Unfortunately, advising day traders is big business, and
there may be more money in that than in day trading. Before you call the 800
number given in the infomercial, read the advice I give here, which can help
you evaluate the service.
There are three main types of outside services:
✓ Price data are detailed, real-time price quotes from different markets.
✓ Chart services help traders identify profitable trends.
✓ Strategic research helps people develop a system for trading or follow a
system designed by someone else.
You may need all three, or none, depending on your knowledge of the finan-
cial markets and your trading style.
Many day traders find themselves subscribing to price quote and analytical
services. The following section is a listing of a handful of popular ones. It’s
not a definitive list, and my including them on this list is not an endorsement.
Rather, it’s a guide to get you thinking about what you may need and where
you can go to get it.
If you know you need outside pricing and data services, consider that when
you select a brokerage firm. Different firms have different software platforms,
and some can handle outside data feeds better than others. For more informa-
tion on choosing a broker, refer to Chapter 11.

Part III: Necessities and Niceties for Successful Day Trading
(Price) Quote me on that
Many brokerage firms offer day trading services. They all have services that
tell you what the prices are for any security at any time, but this doesn’t
mean that they have all the prices that you need for your strategy. If, for
example, you’re day trading common stocks, you may need a system that can
signal certain price patterns in any of the thousands of stocks trading at any
given day. If you’re trading options based on the value of underlying stock,
you may need that data as well. If you’re day trading international securities,
you may need real-time data, and your broker may only offer data with a
ten-minute delay in some markets.
Besides needing all the prices and related volume and market-maker data,
some strategies involve fast trading. Every second counts, and not all brokers
can deliver prices fast enough to make scalping profitable. One solution is
to get prices from a separate source that offers faster delivery. Other trading
strategies don’t require real-time prices on huge numbers of securities, but
they may involve a detailed analysis of end-of-day prices. To do that, you may
need more information than your broker can give you.
The following sections offer information on some of the different price quote
and data services out there.
The quote service can provide the data in real time only if you have enough
bandwidth to receive it. Make sure you have the fastest Internet service and
modem available in your area and consider having a second way to connect
to the Internet if your primary service goes down.
CQG
CQG pulls data from pretty much all of the world’s exchanges, making it
popular with people who are trading international securities. It also has data
on over-the-counter foreign exchange. Traders can buy historical data for
backtesting (see Chapter 16 for more), and they can add charting and order
routing capabilities to their CQG package. People who want to do even more
number crunching on their own can link the data to their Microsoft Excel
spreadsheets.
For more information, go to www.cqg.com.
DTN
Trading fuel or agricultural products? Then you may need more research
than most brokers can give you. DTN produces a huge range of data for farm-
ers and drillers, and it has plenty of services for traders, too. The company,

owned by Schneider Electric, provides pricing and research for commodi-
ties traders, including meteorological research and hurricane-related energy
supply forecasts. Day traders active in stocks or financial futures are more
likely to use the company’s IQ data feeds, which allow users to track 1,300
prices simultaneously, and ProphetX, software that combines price data with
analytics that can track small market movements and can handle displays
on several different monitors at once.

eSignal
eSignal offers detailed prices, news, and trading alerts in most financial
markets, delivered to your computer or your phone. Its charting features are
more advanced than those offered by most brokerage firms. Especially useful
for traders who are looking at several different stocks, eSignal can help iden-
tify trading opportunities using a preferred strategy and scan the market for
other stocks that meet specified investment criteria. The company also offers
backtesting and real-time strategy testing, end-of-day analysis for traders
who don’t need real-time data, and add-on signals that support different
proprietary trading strategies.
For more information, go to www.esignal.com.
InstaQuote
InstaQuote, owned by Bank of America, has data designed for equity options
traders. It gives traders price quotes on both options and equities so that
they can identify price discrepancies and monitor valuation. It then connects
to the exchange’s electronic communications networks, allowing for direct
access trading. InstaQuote’s platform can work with several different broker-
age firms’ accounts.

Oanda
Oanda provides both foreign exchange trading services and data. It has
exchange rates for major currencies and small frontier markets. The data is
available — for a price — to those who want to use it with another brokerage
firm’s platform.

Part III: Necessities and Niceties for Successful Day Trading
Charting your strategy
Almost all day trading strategies rely on technical analysis, which is the
process of identifying buy and sell opportunities based on the supply and
demand for a security. Technical analysts look at charts of price and volume
changes to identify changes in the trend. (I discuss technical analysis in more
detail in Chapter 7.) Some technical-analysis strategies are complicated and
require sophisticated charting. That’s why many day traders use software
that can turn price data into the information they need to make decisions.
Many users of these services get tripped up by the symbols and data displays.
Take the time to learn as much as you can about how the services work before
you trade in real time with real money; most of these providers offer seminars
or online tutorials that can help. Yeah, many of the features are obvious, but
you want to avoid costly mistakes.
MarketDelta
MarketDelta’s software provides detailed charting services that match differ-
ent strategies over several time periods, in colors that make the data stand
out. The goal is to make price information more transparent and thus chart
information more accurate. The company mostly deals with professionals,
but some of its products are suitable for some day traders.
For more information, go to www.marketdelta.com.
Metastock
Metastock has several different charting and analytical packages, including
one for foreign exchange trading, another for people who day trade in stocks,
and a third for stock investors who are holding for longer than a single day. It
even has some fundamental research tools. Traders following specific strate-
gies recommended by different market analysts can purchase add-ons that
give them the tools needed to trade effectively and participate in in-person
and online user groups. Some brokerage firms offer Metastock tools as an
alternative to the broker’s proprietary platform.
For more information, go to www.metastock.com.
NinjaTrader
A trading platform for active traders, NinjaTrader can be used instead of the
trading software offered by many brokerage firms, including several of firms
that deal with day traders. The service is best known for its charting capabili-
ties in the foreign exchange and futures markets, but it can also handle market
scanning, automated trade execution, backtesting, and simulation trading.

OmniTrader
OmniTrader is designed to automate technical analysis (read all about
that in Chapter 7), especially for stock traders. Traders can use it to set up
automatic trading systems or to help them make their own decisions during
the trading day. The system also includes money-management tools (money
management is discussed in Chapter 6), as well as simulated trading and
backtesting to help you find new strategies.

RealTick
RealTick combines price data with charting services and market signals for
stocks, options, futures, and foreign exchange, making it useful for traders who
are working in several markets. Its add-on services let you customize the data
if you have an unusual strategy. The service includes direct-access trading

StockTwits
Social media is a great way to keep up with pop stars and find out local bar-
gains, and it has applications for trading, too. StockTwits is a service that is
similar to Twitter. It lets members post trade ideas and market data, and it
pulls in streams from Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. It’s a way of following
market sentiment more than anything, but sentiment drives markets. And
StockTwits is free.

Trade-Ideas
Trade-Ideas is designed for stock traders. The software scans the incoming
price data feed to find trading opportunities based on prespecified indica-
tors, and it can also show how much the market is deviating from a trader’s
style. For traders watching hundreds or thousands of stocks, Trade-Ideas can
be a useful addendum to a brokerage firm’s offerings.

News, newsletters, gurus, and
strategic advice
Trading relies on information so that everyone in the market can evaluate
what the right price for a security should be. Most of this information can
be found from an analysis of the news and the price data, both of which are
readily available from brokerage firms and quote services. But many traders
follow explicit philosophies or rely on the insight of certain analysts. Here’s a
list of some of the bigger ones you’ll come across.
Many of these market gurus have good ideas, but don’t follow any of them
blindly. Their techniques don’t work in all markets at all times. Besides,
anyone with a truly foolproof plan isn’t going to give it away. These newslet-
ters are just part of the ongoing conversation in the markets that help traders
make decisions.
Briefing.com
If you follow a news-driven trading strategy, you need to know what the news
is. Briefing.com offers daily news summaries and live updates on news events
and ideas for trades that may suit your style. And unlike the standard news
feeds available to anyone with Internet access, it doesn’t have any celebrity
or human-interest stories to distract you.
For more information, go to www.briefing.com.
Elliott Wave
The Elliott Wave is a theory that says markets move in grand cycles over
a century or more. Within that grand cycle are subcycles lasting years,
months, weeks, days, minutes, and seconds. Given all the layers and analysis
required, those who follow the theory usually subscribe to research services
to help them. This site is maintained by Robert Prechter, who is one of the
leading scholars of the theory.
For more information, go to www.elliottwave.com.
School of Gann
The Gann method of technical analysis looks at the slopes of the charts to
predict changes. It’s a complicated system, so traders who follow it usually
rely on newsletters and research services to help them. School of Gann is
one that specializes in this system.

Doing Your Due Diligence
Trading software, training, and research can get expensive, and some
services and seminars are outright scams. Even those that are legitimate
(and most are) may not be right for you. Before you spend your money, do
your research. Start with the free programs offered by the exchanges (listed
in the first section of this chapter) so that you have enough knowledge
to understand what a trading-services purveyor is trying to do. Then do
research and ask questions. To find out where to go and what to ask,
read on.
Where to start your research
You have a ton of tools available to you to do your due diligence. A good place
to start is the Internet. Go to your favorite search engine and enter the name
of the program you’re looking at plus the word scam or rip-off and see what
turns up on the third or fourth page of the search. If nothing of much interest
turns up, proceed to the regulatory agencies listed in the following sections.
Anyone with even a little knowledge of search-engine optimization knows this
tip. If your search turns up 50 blog posts with lines like “Why Company X is
NOT a scam!!!” well, guess what? Company X probably has something to hide,
and if you go to the third or fourth page of the search results, you may find out
what it is. Or just move on, because plenty of legitimate vendors that you can
work with instead are out there.
You may learn very little about any given research firm from an Internet search
or checks with the different regulatory organizations. That doesn’t mean the
firm in question isn’t for real, just that it hasn’t caused any concerns so far.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (www.cftc.gov/
ConsumerProtection/index.htm) regulates options and futures mar-
kets, which are popular with day traders. Although not as well known as the
Securities and Exchange Commission, its functions are similar. At its website,
you can check out investor advisories, known scams, and recent enforcement
efforts to see whether the vendor you’re thinking of working with is legiti-
mate or too good to be true.
FINRA BrokerCheck
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) provides a handy service
that lets you check on the current enforcement status of different brokerage
firms and their employees, especially in the stock, bond, and options markets.

Chapter 13: Researching Research Services
Some of these firms and people may be offering research services or newslet-

putes over customer funds, should send you running. Go to www.finra.org/

National Futures Association BASIC
Futures are popular with day traders, and they’re regulated by the National
Futures Association. Its Background Affiliation Status Information Center
(BASIC), at www.nfa.futures.org/BasicNet, gives you information on
people and firms registered with the National Futures Association.

Commission offers lots of great information about every aspect of stock and
bond investing, with a special emphasis on problems and scams to avoid.

Don’t let the information scare you away from the market; use it to evaluate
any services that you’re thinking of paying for.
Questions to ask
After you do your basic background checks, you’re ready to ask some ques-
tions about the service providers you’re considering. Talk to the customer
service reps, and try talking to other traders as well. This section contains a
list of questions to get you started.
✓ Can I get a free trial to check the service out?
✓ What training and support do you offer? Do you have a user community?
✓ How long will it take me to learn the system? Will I need to pay for addi-
tional training and coaching, or is your built-in support adequate?
✓ Who will be teaching me or advising me, and what is this person’s
background?
✓ How long have you been in business? Why was the company formed?
✓ What additional features are available at additional costs? How many
customers subscribe to only the basic system?
✓ Does this system support my trading style and work with the assets I
prefer to trade?
✓ Do you screen traders for your program? Do you ask traders to leave? What
are the characteristics of those who do well? Of those who don’t do well?

✓ Can I talk to other customers?
✓ Is your software compatible with my broker? With other services I’m
using? With my computer’s operating system? With my Internet
bandwidth?
✓ Are your performance numbers actual, or are they hypothetical and
based on backtesting? How were the numbers calculated? (Chapter 16
has more information on performance calculation.)
Hypothetical performance is based on an analysis of what would have hap-
pened had the system been in place in the past or of what may happen if
market conditions cooperate. It can be subject to data mining, which means
that the system was developed to generate good performance in backtesting,
not because it has any logical or theoretical basis.
Don’t trust any promises of performance. Day trading is a difficult business.
Many people wash out because it doesn’t suit their personality. Others fail
because they don’t have enough startup capital, they don’t take the time to
figure out how to do it, or they simply have a run of bad luck. No one can
promise that you’ll succeed.

Stress Management in the
Trading Day
In This Chapter
▶ Reading cautionary tales of traders gone wrong
▶ Finding out how to control your emotions
▶ Checking out the paramount trading plan
D
ay trading can be a ruthless business. Some days, you don’t find any
trades worth making. Other days, you find trades, but they don’t work
out the way you want them to. And some days, there are too many good
trades, more than you can possibly make, and so you watch profitable oppor-
tunities slip away. When you’re working with real money, all this stress can be
too much to take.
In a money-management or brokerage firm, traders have tremendous camarade-
rie. They work for the same employer and stick together to blow off the stress.
What do you do at home, though? How do you keep from panicking, getting
depressed, or otherwise letting this business hurt your profits and hurt you?
If you’re going to day trade, you need to understand the very real physical
and psychological stresses that the market pushes on its participants. In this
chapter, I offer some information and advice that can help you avoid a crisis.
Heeding Tales of Those Who Failed
Trader lore is loaded with stories of people who flamed out in spectacular and
destructive ways. People who work on trading desks or on trading floors tell
tales of colleagues who freaked out, walked off the desk, broke down in the pit,
or died at the trading post. They can name colleagues who are alcoholics, who
suffered bitter divorces, who committed suicide. Even though day traders usu-
ally work by themselves, stories of their self-destructive behavior abound.

Part III: Necessities and Niceties for Successful Day Trading
Because not that many people day trade consistently, not a lot of good
demographic studies have been conducted on just how many day traders
end up abusing drugs and alcohol, getting divorced or becoming estranged
from friends, and turning to suicide. The anecdotal evidence is pretty strong,
though. People in the securities business face high pressure and real dollar
losses every day they go to work. Their performance is constantly judged by
the market, and it doesn’t grade on a curve. If you spend even a few minutes
talking to people in the business, you hear horror stories.
Don’t be the person who finally gives researchers enough critical mass to
report on day trader self-destruction. Stress is a real part of day trading, and
not all day traders handle it well. If you know what you’re up against and
prepare for it, you’ll be better off than many.
Many, probably most, day traders lead pleasant lives and suffer no more prob-
lems than any other person. That’s because they have perspective, balance,
and a personality that matches the demands of the business. The following
sections offer a few cautionary tales of traders who succumbed to the pres-
sures inherent in the job. I relate them here for this simple reason: Knowing
what can go wrong can help you keep in the right.
Jesse Livermore
Jesse Livermore is sometimes considered to be the father of day trading.
He’s the subject of the book Reminiscences of a Stock Operator by Edwin
LeFevre, a classic book about trading (see the appendix for more information).
Livermore was born in 1877 and started trading stocks when he was in his
teens. He claimed to have made $1,000 when he was 15, which may not seem
like much, except that he was very young and that $1,000 would be worth
more than $20,000 in today’s dollars. He made huge fortunes betting against
the market in 1907 and again in 1929, and he managed to lose it all both times.
By 1934 he was broke and depressed. He attempted suicide in 1935 and
succeeded in 1940.
Steve Perkins
Is he a cautionary tale, or the man who learned from his mistakes? Steve
Perkins is an energy trader who worked for PVM Oil Futures, a London-based
firm. One night in 2009, he got very drunk, got out his laptop computer, and
started buying futures; he ended up controlling almost 70 percent of the world’s
oil market and left his firm with $10 million in losses. He was fired and banned
from trading in the U.K. However, in 2010, he was hired by an energy trading
firm in Switzerland, and, it is hoped, he will not make that mistake again.

Chapter 14: Stress Management in the Trading Day
Knight Capital
Knight Capital is a company, not a person, but its story is a good one to keep
in mind given how much electronic trading takes place anymore. The com-
pany is a major dealer in the stock and equity options markets. It trades for
its own account, buying and selling securities from discount brokerage firms
to help them execute trades more efficiently. In the wee hours of the morning
on August 1, 2012, the company did a software upgrade. When the market
opened at 9:30 am New York time, Knight Capital sent a flood of erroneous
orders into the market. It turned out that there was a flaw in the software
that was installed. Ooops! Before the trading system was shut down, Knight
Capital lost $440 million dollars. The firm would have folded if it had not been
taken over by a competitor, GETCO.
Unlike Knight Capital, day traders don’t get bailed out by competitors. Risk-
management techniques can help minimize your risk, and so can having a
backup trading method (say, on a laptop or phone) to help you close out
quick if your computer does something goofy.
Controlling Your Emotions
The key to successful day trading is controlling your emotions. After all, the
stock doesn’t know that you own it, as equity traders like to say, so it isn’t
going to perform well just because you want it to. This can be infuriating,
especially when you are going through a draw-down of your capital. Those
losses look mighty personal.
Traditional financial theory is based on the idea that traders are rational. In
practice, however, most of them are not. In fact, traders and investors are
often irrational in completely predictable ways, which has given birth to a
growing area of study called behavioral finance. It’s a hot area generating
Nobel Prize winners, and it may eventually help people incorporate measures
of investor behavior into buy and sell decisions.
If you can’t figure out a way to manage your reactions to the market, you
shouldn’t be a day trader. Almost all day traders talk about their enemies being
fear and greed. If you panic, you’ll no longer be trading to win, but trading not
to lose. That’s an important distinction: If your goal is not to lose, you won’t
take appropriate risk, and you won’t be able to respond quickly to what the
market is telling you.
Controlling your emotions is all much easier said than done. Human beings
are emotional creatures, constantly reacting (and sometimes overreacting) to

everything that happens in their lives. Knowing the emotions that affect trad-
ing and having some ways to manage them can greatly improve your overall
performance.
Dealing with destructive emotions
In trading, the big emotions can take over and mess up your strategy and
your returns. The enemies are doubt, fear, and greed; like any bullies, they
have their toadies, including anger, anxiety, boredom, and depression. At
this point in your life, you may already know whether you have tendencies
toward any of these moods. If so, trading can exacerbate them. If you’ve
never experienced them, you may for the first time. The following sections
explain these emotions as they relate to day trading so that you know what
you’re up against and can plan accordingly.
I include some tips that can help you deal with destructive reactions, but if
you are really in the throes of an emotional crisis that affects your trading,
seek professional help. And by all means, walk away from the trading desk.
Doubt
Day traders have to act fast. They have to place their buy and sell orders
as the opportunities present themselves. The market doesn’t give anyone
time to second-guess the decisions, but many traders start to do just that.
Did the signal really flash? Is this pattern going to continue or reverse? Will
waiting a few seconds lead to a better price? Would closing out for the day
just be better?
I don’t know. And neither do you. That’s why traders need to stick to their
plans, which isn’t always easy. Backtesting (explained in Chapter 16) can help
build confidence in a plan, and the use of automated trading tools (refer to
Chapter 13) can help overcome the tendency to hesitate before clicking on
the mouse button.
Most brokerage firms that offer services to day traders have automated trading
capabilities to help you follow your plan. And all brokers can execute stop and
limit orders, which can help you get out of positions based on your plans
rather than your emotions.
Fear
Fear is one of the worst emotional enemies of the day trader. Instead of trying
to make money, the fearful trader tries hard not to lose it. She is so afraid of
failing that she limits herself, doesn’t take appropriate risk, and questions her
trading system so much that she no longer follows it, no matter how well it
worked for her in the past.



==================================================
                     PAGE 251                     
==================================================

235
Chapter 14: Stress Management in the Trading Day
By the way, failure isn’t the only thing that traders fear. Many fear success,
sometimes for deep-seated psychological reasons that I am in no position
to address. A trader who fears success may think that if she succeeds, her
friends will treat her differently, her relatives will try to take her money, and
that she will become someone she doesn’t want to be.
One way to limit fear is to have a plan for the trading business. Before you
start trading, take some time — maybe half a day — to sit down and think
about what you want, what will happen to you if you get it, and what will
happen to you if you don’t. For example, if you lose your trading capital, then
you’ll have to live on your walk-away fund (see the section “Watching your
walk-away money” later in this chapter) until you find another job. If you
make a lot of money, then you can pay off your mortgage, and your friends
will be none the wiser.
Greed
Greed seems like a silly thing to have on this list. After all, isn’t the whole pur-
pose of day trading to make money? This isn’t charity; this is capitalism at its
purest. Ah, but there’s a popular saying down at the Chicago Board of Trade:
“Pigs get fat, but hogs get slaughtered.”
Traders who get greedy start to do stupid things. They don’t think through
what they’re doing, and they stop following their trading plans. They hold
positions too long in the hope of eking out a return, and sometimes they
make rash trades that look an awful lot like gambling. The greedy trader loses
all discipline and eventually loses quite a bit of money.
If your goal is simply to make more and more money, you may have a
problem with greed. Sure, everyone wants to make more, but there are
also a basic need-to-make number (enough to cover your costs and your
basic living expenses) and a want-to-make number (enough to cover costs,
basic expenses, and extras that are important to you). Your want-to-make
can be open ended (as in “as much as possible”), but your need-to-make
should be a key component of your risk management. If you know
what those numbers are, you’re well on your way to preventing the
problem.
Limit orders, which automatically close out positions when they hit set prices,
are one way to force discipline in the face of greed. You can learn more about
limit orders in Chapter 2.
Anger
The markets can be maddening. They don’t do what you want them to, and
that often costs you real money. And no one wants to lose money. Your rage
at the markets can cause you to stop seeing straight.

==================================================

236
Part III: Necessities and Niceties for Successful Day Trading
When anger makes it impossible to think clearly, your best bet is to call it a
day, close out your positions, and go somewhere far from your trading
screen. Leave your phone at home if you’re using your broker’s mobile apps,
too! Take a long walk and wait for your anger to subside. Otherwise, your
rage will interfere with your plans and your profitability. The only way to
psych out the market is to be just as mechanical and unemotional as the
blips that cross your screen.
Anxiety
Anxiety is the anticipation of things going wrong, and it often includes
a physical response: perspiration, clenched jaws, tense muscles, heart
palpitations, and so on. Anxious people worry, agonize, overanalyze, and
generally stress out. And then they avoid whatever it is that makes them
upset. That means that a trader may not make an obvious trade but instead
hesitate and miss a market move. He may hold on to a losing position too
long because he’s worried about the effect that selling it will have on his
portfolio. He becomes too nervous to trade according to his plan, and his
performance suffers.
One way to combat anxiety is through automated trading and limit orders. If
your limits are set when you place the trade, then your anxiety can’t override
your plan.
Boredom
An ugly truth about day trading is that it can be really dull. In an eight-hour
trading session, you may spend seven and a half hours waiting for the right
opening. A flurry of trades, and it’s all over. To keep yourself entertained, you
may start making bad trades, spending too much time in chat rooms, or let-
ting your mind wander away from the task at hand. None of those things is
conducive to profitable trading.
One way to reduce the temptations brought on by boredom is to block access to
social media on your trading computer. Several companies make software that
will keep you from using Facebook, Pinterest, or Addicting Games when you
should be trading! A few to consider are Anti-Social (www.anti-social.cc)
and Cold Turkey (www.getcoldturkey.com). Keep in mind that they may slow
down your system — and that your phone may need a social-media blocker, too.
Depression
Depression is a severe downturn in your mood, especially one that causes
you to feel inadequate and lose interest in things you used to like. Although
everyone is susceptible to depression, the ups and downs of the market can
make traders particularly vulnerable. At best, depression can make it hard
for a trader to face a day with the market. At worst, it can lead to alcoholism,
alienation, and even suicide.

Chapter 14: Stress Management in the Trading Day
If you think you may be depressed, check out the self-assessment at www.
mayoclinic.com/health/depression/MH00103_D. Or better yet, go to
your doctor. He or she will give you a better diagnosis than Dr. Internet.
Having an outlet
Successful day traders have a life outside the markets. They close out
their positions, shut off their monitors, and go do something else with the
rest of the day. The problem is that a market is always open somewhere.
Undisciplined traders work overnight and after hours through electronic
communications networks and sometimes move the action to exchanges in
other parts of the world. Think about Steve Perkins, losing millions of dollars
in the middle of the night! Without something to mark a beginning and an
end to your trading day, and without other things happening in your life, the
market can consume you in an unhealthy way.
So as you plan your life as a day trader, think about what else you’re going to
do with your days. Exercise, meditation, socializing, and having outside inter-
ests are keys to maintaining balance and staying focused on the market when
you have to be. The following sections go into more detail.
Exercise
Exercise keeps your body in fighting shape so that you can stand up to
market stress and react to trends when you need to. Many times when you’re
trading, you have huge rushes of adrenaline that you can’t do much about.
You have to stay in front of your screen until the trade is over, no matter how
much you want to run away screaming. But after the trading day, you can hit
the track or pool or treadmill and burn off some of that adrenaline. Figuring
out a regular exercise routine can pay off for your trading.
If you aren’t an exerciser now, call your local YMCA. It has introductory pro-
grams that can teach you how to use the equipment and help you design a
workout that suits your current fitness levels and goals.
Meditation
When you’re trading, you may get upset and start thinking about everything
else that has ever gone wrong in your life, instead of staying focused on the
task at hand. Even after you close out your positions and shut down your
monitors, your day’s trading may keep playing itself out over and over in
your head, making it impossible for you to relax. Neither of these scenarios is
good for you — or your trading.
Trading requires mental discipline. Good traders can keep their minds clear
of everything but their trading system, at least when the markets are at their

hairiest. One way to develop that discipline is to take up meditation. Yeah,
it may seem goofy, being a big tough trader type doing something woo-woo
like meditation, but if you have trouble keeping your focus, you really may
want to give it a try. There are an almost infinite number of meditation styles,
many of which are associated with different religious traditions, so you
can surely find something that works. Research compiled by the Center for
Complementary and Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of Health
(http://nccam.nih.gov/health/meditation/overview.htm) shows
that many people report mental-health benefits from meditation.
Check out the instructions for the Buddhist mindfulness meditation practice
at www.shambhala.org/meditationinstruction.html as a way to get
started.
Friends and family
Day trading is a lonely activity. You work by yourself all day. It’s just you,
your room, and your screen. This job is really isolating. If you don’t get other
human contact, you run the risk of personalizing the market in order not to
feel so lonely. That’s bad, because the market isn’t a person; it’s an agglom-
eration of all the financial activity taking place, and it has no interest in you
whatsoever.
No matter what you do in life, you want to have the support of the people you
know and love. And you need to make time for them, too. Start and end your
trading day at regular times and be sure to make plans to see people who
are important to you. Going to your kid’s ball game, having dinner with your
spouse, and seeing your friends for a few beers on a regular basis can go a long
way to keeping your life in balance — and that will keep your trading in balance.
If you like pets, consider getting one to keep you company during the day.
There’s nothing like a dog that needs a walk to force you to close shop for the
night.
Hobbies and other interests
A lot of people get into day trading because they have long had a fascination
with the market. Trading goes from being a hobby to being a living. In many
ways, that’s perfect. Going to work is so much easier when you have a job
that you love.
But if the market is your only interest, then you’re going to be too susceptible
to its gyrations, and you’re going to have trouble sticking to your trading
discipline. Plus, whatever upsets you during the trading day is more likely to
carry over. So find a new hobby if you don’t have one. Maybe it’s a TV show,
a sport, or knitting, but whatever it is, you need to have something going on
outside of your trading.
Trading is just one part of your life.

Chapter 14: Stress Management in the Trading Day
Setting up support systems
Exercise and friends and family and hobbies and the like are all well and
good, but they don’t directly address the mindset of trading. Fortunately, a
veritable industry supports traders, and you can tap in to it easily. Many day
traders find that reading books, hiring a coach, or finding other day traders
helps them get through the day.
Books
A library full of books has been written on the psychology of trading itself. In
addition, many traders rely on other self-help and history books for inspiration
and ideas. (I think every trader I’ve ever known owns a copy of Sun Tzu’s
The Art of War, which is about military strategies and tactics. They find that this
book helps them prepare their minds to face the market — or at least gives them
something interesting to talk about.) I list several books in the appendix that
may help you organize your mind and keep your enthusiasm for the market.
Counseling and coaching
Because handling big losses — and big gains —takes a lot of mental tough-
ness, many traders find professional support. They use counselors, psycholo-
gists, or life coaches to help them deal with the challenges of the market and
understand their reactions to it. You can ask other traders or your doctor
for a referral, or check the online directory at Psychology Today’s website,
www.psychologytoday.com, or the International Coach Federation, www.
coachfederation.org. When interviewing coaches or counselors, ask
whether they have experience with traders or others who work in finance.
Many day-trading training and brokerage firms also offer coaching services
that specialize in helping people learn and follow day-trading strategies.
Some day traders find these people to be invaluable, whereas others find
they are just glorified salespeople.
Finding other traders
To offset the loneliness of trading alone, many day traders choose to join
organizations where they will meet other traders. These may be formal or
informal groups (I list a few in the appendix) where traders can socialize,
learn new things, or just commiserate.
Many day traders also get together through Internet message boards and
chat rooms. I discuss this option in more detail later in this chapter and list
a few in the appendix. These groups are less formal, more anonymous, and
sometimes as destructive as supportive.
Most day traders lose money and give up their first year. You may find
that spending too much time with other traders is more depressing than
supportive.

Part III: Necessities and Niceties for Successful Day Trading
Watching your walk-away money
A lot of traders have a secret that lets them get through the worst of the markets.
It’s something called walk-away money, although traders sometimes use more
colorful language to describe it. Walk-away money is just what its name implies:
enough money to let the trader walk away from trading and do something else.
And just exactly how much walk-away money does a trader need? Well, the
exact amount varies from person to person, but having enough money to pay
three months’ worth of expenses on hand and in cash is a good place to start.
If you know that you can pay the mortgage and buy the groceries even if you
don’t make money trading today, you’re better able to avoid desperate trad-
ing. You won’t have to be greedy, and you won’t have to live in fear.
The more money in your walk-away fund, the better. Then you have more
time to investigate alternative careers should day trading prove not to be
your thing, and you can relax more when you face the market every day.
Most day traders quit after a year or so. There’s nothing wrong with deciding
to move on and try something else. If you have some money saved, then you’re
in a better position to control when you stop trading and what you do next.
If all your trading capital is gone, you may be tempted to tap your walk-away
fund to stay in the game. Don’t. That’s the exactly the time that you should use
your walk-away money to walk away, if only for a short time to clear your
head, rethink your strategies, and build up some new trading capital.
Otherwise, your trading losses may become financial ruin.
Managing Stress with Your Trading Plan
You may have noticed that trading plans pop up several times in this book.
That’s because they are so important to maintaining the discipline that leads
to trading success. You have to know what you’re doing and how to recognize
entry and exit points and then go and do it.
In this section, I cover how you can use a trading plan to manage stress and
give you a few tips for sticking to your trading plan even as the markets
sometimes move against you.
Avoiding problems following your plan
A good, tested trading plan sets out market patterns that work often enough that
you can make good trading profits. But some people have trouble following their
plan, and that leads to stressful mistakes. Following are some common problems
and advice on how you can avoid — or overcome — them.

Chapter 14: Stress Management in the Trading Day
Prevent choking!
In sports lingo, an athlete who chokes starts playing so carefully that he or
she looks like a beginner. Choking is often caused by overthinking — by being
so afraid of failure that the mind slows down and breaks the play down step
by step. Watching a contender break down in a championship game isn’t
pretty. The fans want to see a good match.
Anyone in a high-performance situation can choke. When a trader chokes, he
seems to be following the plan, but it’s no longer automatic. Trading becomes
so slow and deliberative that obvious trades get missed.
The more you trust your plan, the less likely you are to choke. Has it been
tested? Are there parts that you can automate? Chapter 16 has some ideas on
how to measure a trading plan’s performance before you start to trade with
the plan.
Reduce panic
Panic occurs when you just stop thinking. Your most basic survival
instincts take over, even when they are totally uncalled for. You’re losing
money? You start to trade more and more, off-plan, in a desperate gamble
to win it back. You’re making money? You close out all your trades right
now so that you can’t possibly lose, even if your plan tells you to hold your
positions. When you panic, you can’t think straight, and you can’t follow
your plan.
When your positions are down and you seem to be losing money, you really
should be buying and sticking it out so that you can make money later. The
problem is that your panicked instincts are telling you to do the opposite.
Following through on your plan rather than knuckling under to your instincts
is tough to do and requires a lot of discipline. With experience, traders learn
to avoid panic.
You’re probably going to have more than a few losing trades when you get
started. In your trading diary (see Chapter 16), keep notes about how losing
money makes you feel. Can you handle it emotionally? If losing upsets you too
much, you may not be cut out for day trading. You can’t trade with a clear
head if you’re bogged down with negative thoughts.
Nurture your confidence, not your ego
Day trading requires a lot of confidence because you are going to lose money
and you are going to get beaten up some days. Not only do you have to
remain confident in the face of adversity, but you also have to be careful that
you do not cross from confidence into an inflated ego. The more your trading
success and failure become part of your personal identity, the more trouble
you’re going to have.

Part III: Necessities and Niceties for Successful Day Trading
What’s the difference between confidence and ego? A confident person would
say, “I’m smart enough to figure out what the market is telling me”; an egotistical
person, “I’m smarter than the market.” The difference is crucial to your success.
Revising and troubleshooting
your trading plan
Strong discipline is key to success in trading, but only if you’re disciplined
in following the right system. If your trading method is flawed, sticking to it
is going to hurt you. If something isn’t working, don’t get mad at the system;
take some responsibility and make some changes.
How do you figure out whether your trading system is right and what
changes to make? Go through your trading diary (see Chapter 16 for how to
set one up) and ask yourself some questions:
✓ Why did you choose this system? What is the market telling you about
it? Is it telling you that the system works if you follow it, or is it telling
you that something is wrong with the underlying assumptions?
What works for someone else may not work for you. There’s no flaw in
admitting that you made a mistake and that you need to make a change.
✓ Were your mistakes because you followed the plan or because you
didn’t?
✓ What part of the system is causing the trouble? Are you having trouble
identifying entry points or exit points? Or are you stuck when the time
comes to enter the trade, causing you to miss a point? Or do the trades
your system identifies never seem to work out? When you know where
the problem is, you can change it.
✓ Can you improve your trade efficiency? Is there a way to reduce the
number of mistakes? Would automating some or all of your trading help?
One way to get your confidence back while still staying in the market is to
trade in very small amounts so that your profits and losses don’t really matter.
Trade 100 shares, not 1,000 shares. You give up the upside for a time, but you
can also get out of the cycle of greed and fear that has destroyed many a
trader.

T
hink day trade returns come without a catch? Think again, because the
IRS has plenty of ways to catch you come April 15. Day trading involves
strategies that generate both high returns and high tax liabilities, which can
eat away at your total return if you’re not careful. Not all your expenses are
deductible, and although you may think that you’re day trading, the IRS may
have a different definition of your activities.
Taxes themselves aren’t necessarily bad, because citizens have to pay for
things like roads and schools and national defense somehow. But taxes can
be devastating to your personal finances if you haven’t planned for them.
You need to consider the tax implications of your trading strategy right
from the start and keep careful records so that you’re ready.
Tax issues for day traders are complex and change frequently. And because
the federal government is broke, as are most of the states, don’t expect the tax
rules to get easier. Check the most recent federal regulations at www.irs.gov
and work with an accountant or tax expert who has experience in these
matters. This chapter is just a guide. I’m a reasonably social gal and all, but
I’m not going on an audit with you.

Part III: Necessities and Niceties for Successful Day Trading
Getting the Lay of the Land: What You
Need to Know Based on What You Trade
The Internal Revenue code is complex, with specific rules for specific types
of transactions. You can easily get tripped up, and a tax trip-up can be costly.
Here I give an overview of different types of day-trading assets and some of
the tax implications associated with them.
Commodities and futures
Of the many reasons that day traders work with commodity and futures con-
tacts, one is that the taxes are easy to handle. Under Section 1256 of the IRS
code, certain types of contracts — for example, regulated futures contracts,
foreign currency contracts, and non-equity options (on debt, commodities,
currencies, and stock market indexes) that are marked-to-market in trading —
are handled under the 60/40 rule. This rule stipulates that 60 percent of your
total capital gain or loss will be treated as a long-term capital gain or loss, and
the other 40 percent of your gain or loss will be treated as a short-term gain
or loss. How long you held the position doesn’t matter. Why is this rule so
nice? Because the long-term capital gains rate is less than the short-term rate,
and you as a day trader can take advantage of it, even though, by definition,
day traders don’t hold positions over the long haul.
Currency trading
If you trade currencies, the tax laws that apply to you can be confusing, and
they have gray areas. How taxes apply to you can be impacted by the following:
✓ Whether you’re an individual or a business: Small individual currency
transactions are usually considered to be like-kind exchanges; for
example, if you go on vacation to Mexico, exchange your dollars to pesos
when the dollar is strong, and then change whatever remains back at
the border a week later when the dollar is a bit weaker, you’ll have made
a profit. However, this transaction is not a reportable one, because, in
essence, you exchanged two identical items: money for money.
A business, however, can accrue taxable gains and losses due to changes
in exchange rates. If a company makes goods in the United States and
sells them through its Mexican subsidiary, for example, the amount
of profit or loss that the subsidiary has depends on the exchange rate



==================================================

==================================================

245
Chapter 15: Taxes for Traders
between the dollar and the peso, and that determines the amount of
tax that the company pays. In this case, identical objects aren’t being
exchanged. (The IRS has plenty of rules on how businesses should
handle foreign exchange under Section 988 of the tax code.)
✓ Whether you’re trading actual currency or futures and options on
currencies: Futures and options on currencies are taxed under Section
1256 using the handy 60/40 rule described in the preceding section. But
you’re trading in the spot market. You aren’t trading currency contracts;
you’re trading actual currency. What do you do about profits and losses
you may accrue?
The IRS isn’t keen on your claiming a tax-free like-kind exchange if your
goal is to make a living trading currencies. But you aren’t running a busi-
ness with overseas operations, are you? Unfortunately, there are no clear
guidelines here, so you probably want to work with an accountant. The
general thought is that you can report your currency trading through
Section 988 or Section 1256. Under Section 988, your trading gains and
losses are considered short-term capital gains in your trading business.
This arrangement saves you money if you lost money trading but costs
you if you made money. Under Section 1256, your spot trading is handled
as futures contracts, and you pay short-term capital gains taxes on 40
percent of your profits and long-term capital gains taxes on the remain-
ing 60 percent of your profit. This saves you money in the years you
made money.
The key? Be consistent. You can’t file under Section 988 when you lose
money and under Section 1256 in years you make money. That game
makes the IRS very unhappy, and you don’t want to have the tax guys
unhappy with you.
Although you should consider this entire chapter as a guideline and not pro-
fessional tax advice, this warning holds particularly true for the information
on currencies. At the time I am writing this, both the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission and the Internal Revenue Service are taking a close look
at the forex market to clarify the regulations, so the information may be very
different when you do your taxes.
Options
The taxation of options is more complicated than the taxation of other deriv-
atives. The basic information is the same: A gain on an option held for less
than a year is a short-term capital gain, and a gain on one held for more than
a year is a long-term capital gain. There are two problems, though. The first is
that some options strategies offer a combination of short-term and long-term

gains and losses. The second is that options trades fall under the wash-sale
rule (explained later in this chapter), which limits your ability to make trades
of fewer than 30 days in the same securities.
Options have one other wrinkle: You can’t use options to manage taxable sales
and gains in stocks. An option on a stock is considered to be substantially
identical to the stock. That’s why the tax treatment is pretty much the same —
and why professional tax advice is really important if you’re trading options.
The Chicago Board Options Exchange publishes a detailed guide to stock
and stock-options taxation. You can download it at www.cboe.com/
LearnCenter/pdf/TaxesandInvesting.pdf.
Stock trading
In Chapter 4, I cover the differences between investing, trading, and gambling.
Day traders aren’t investing; they’re looking to take advantage of short-term
price movements, not to take a stake in a business for the long term. Unless, of
course, you’re asking the IRS about it. The IRS defines trading much differently
than people in financial circles do. To the taxmen, you are a trader only if all of
the following apply to you:
✓ You seek to profit from daily market movements in the prices of
securities, not from dividends, interest, or capital appreciation.
✓ Your activity is substantial; the IRS code does not spell out what substantial
means, but it probably means you’re making at least 3,000 trades per year.
✓ You carry on the activity with continuity and regularity. In other words,
day trading is more or less your full-time job, you’ve stuck with it for at
least six months already, and you plan to keep trading into the next year.
The 2013 Tax Court case Endicott v. Commissioner addressed the issue of
substantial when deciding whether a person is a trader. The plaintiff made
1,543 trades in 2008, which the IRS said was substantial. The 303 trades
made in 2007 did not meet the definition. The taxpayer traded on 75 days in
2006, 99 days in 2007, and 112 days in 2008, and the court ruled that none of
those met the requirement for frequent, continuous, or regular trading. This
ruling is the clearest guidance issued in a long time.
IRS Tax Topic 429 covers the matter in more detail. If you trade part-time, have
other employment, or are new to the day-trading game, the IRS probably won’t
let you define yourself as a trader. Don’t care what an IRS agent calls you,
as long she doesn’t call you for an audit? Well, understanding the difference
between trader and investor in IRS lingo is important to avoid that audit.



==================================================

==================================================

247
Chapter 15: Taxes for Traders
Those who qualify as traders enjoy deductions that regular investors don’t.
You may quality as a trader for some of your activities and as an investor for
others. If you think this scenario applies to you, you need to keep detailed
records to separate your trades, and you should use different brokerage
accounts to make the difference clear from the day you open the position.
In political economics, taxation serves two purposes. The first is to raise
money for the government. The second is to encourage people to do things
that the elected officials who amend the tax code want them to do. Much of
the investing tax code is intended to promote the formation and growth of
businesses. Short-term day trading doesn’t do that, so the tax law doesn’t
offer short-term investors the same benefits that it gives to long-term
investors and business owners.
Hiring a Tax Adviser
You don’t have to hire someone to do your taxes, but you probably should.
Day trading generates a lot of separate transactions to track, and the tax laws
are tricky. Mistakes can end up costing you your entire trading profit.
Do yourself a favor and find yourself a tax expert. You can talk to other
traders, get references from the attorneys and accountants you work with
now, or even do Internet searches to find people who understand both IRS
regulations and the unique needs of people who frequently buy and sell
securities, whether or not the IRS calls them traders.
The many flavors of tax experts
Okay, you’re waiting for me to say there’s only one flavor of accountant, and
it’s plain vanilla, right? Wrong. Tax experts fall into several different categories,
and knowing which is which can help you determine who is best for you:
✓ Certified public accountants: Certified public accountants studied
accounting in college and passed exams testing their knowledge of a
wide range of accounting subjects. Because much of accounting involves
income-tax preparation, many CPAs specialize in this. CPAs generally have
the best combined knowledge of tax laws and tax preparation techniques,
but not all of them specialize in or even understand day trading.
✓ Enrolled agents: Enrolled agents specialize in tax preparation. They
receive registration from the IRS after passing a two-day, eight-hour
exam covering only tax topics, which is what they know best. They may
not be so good at helping you with other accounting needs, such as
preparing payroll for your office assistants.

==================================================

248
Part III: Necessities and Niceties for Successful Day Trading
✓ Tax attorneys: Tax attorneys usually work with CPAs; they are called in
to study the legality of proposed strategies or represent a client in tax
litigation. They aren’t appropriate for most traders, but you may have
situations that call for one.
✓ Storefronts and volunteers (probably not a good idea): Every winter,
vacant buildings are turned into tax-preparation centers, and the IRS
promotes its cadre of volunteers who help people with their taxes. These
services can be a boon to the average person who lacks the time or
patience to deal with the tax forms. But if you are trader, you’re going to
run into complex problems that most of these services are not prepared
to handle, such as the many considerations that go with taxes on cur-
rency trading discussed previously.
Only CPAs, enrolled agents, and tax attorneys are allowed to represent clients
before the IRS in audits, collections, or appeals. Other paid preparers can
represent clients in an audit, but they can’t handle more complex matters.
Questions to ask a prospective adviser
After you identify a few prospective candidates to prepare your taxes, talk
to them and ask them questions about their experience. You want some-
one who understands things such as the wash-sale rule (which can limit the
deductibility of your losses and is covered in more detail in the later section
“Understanding the wash-sale rule”) and the mark-to-market election (which
can allow you to deduct more losses; see the section “Mark-to-market
accounting”) and who can help you determine what you owe in taxes and
not one penny more.
Here some things you should ask a potential tax preparer:
✓ What investors and traders have you worked with? For how long?
✓ Have you worked with traders or investors in my state? Can you prepare
my state return?
✓ Have you helped traders make the mark-to-market election?
✓ What is your experience with the wash-sale rule? How will my trading
style be affected by it?
✓ Who will be preparing my return? How involved will you be?
✓ Do you offer tax analysis of trading strategies?

==================================================

249
Chapter 15: Taxes for Traders
✓ What’s your audit record? Why have your clients been audited? What
happened on the audit?
✓ What are your fees?
By law, tax preparers cannot base their fees on the size of your tax refund, and
they cannot guarantee you a refund. Any preparer who does these things
either does not know the law or is willfully breaking it.
You’ll feel more comfortable with your tax preparer if you have an understanding
of the issues at stake. Even if you are hiring someone — and you should —
keep reading this chapter and check the appendix for references on taxes and
trading.
Doing Your Taxes Yourself
Traders can do their own taxes. If you are comfortable with tax forms, if you
are only day trading a little bit, and if I haven’t deterred you yet, you may be
able to handle your own taxes. Here’s what you need: the proper IRS forms
and tax preparation software that can handle investment income.
Finding out everything you want to know
The IRS website, www.irs.gov, is a treasure trove of tax information. All the
regulations, publications, forms, and explanations are there, and some of it
is even in plain English. The site is so vast and detailed that you’ll probably
be overwhelmed (I’m not sure there is any page in any IRS publication that
doesn’t mention dividends received under the State of Alaska Permanent
Fund).
Curious to know about this State of Alaska Permanent Fund? It’s an annual
payment made to all residents of Alaska every year, based on the profits of oil
pumped in that state. To put this amount into context, Alaska had 731,449
residents in 2012, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. I think there are two
pages of IRS publications mentioning the fund for every person who gets a
check from it.
The primary publication that covers the tax implications of trading and other
investing activities is Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses. It’s
available at www.irs.gov/publications/p550/.

Making it easier with tax-preparation
software
The brave people who do their own taxes know that tax-prep software is a
godsend, and it’s even more valuable for those do-it-yourselfers who trade
a lot. The software fills out the forms, automatically adds and subtracts,
and even catches typographical errors. In many cases, it can download data
straight from your brokerage account, making data entry really simple.
Most of the big brands, such as TaxCut and TurboTax, publish several
editions each year — not all of which are set up to import and manage lots
of trading data. Among those that have services for investors are TurboTax
Premier Investments (www.turbotax.com), H&R Block at Home Premium
(www.hrblock.com), and CompleteTax (www.completetax.com).
Income Categories You Need to Know
Income seems like a straightforward concept, but not much about taxation is
straightforward. To the IRS, income falls into different categories, with different
tax rates, different allowed deductions, and different forms to fill out. In this
section, I cover income definitions you’ll run into as a day trader.
Earned income
Earned income includes wages, salaries, bonuses, and tips. It’s money that
you make on the job. But even if day trading is your only occupation, your
earnings are not considered to be earned income. Therefore day traders,
whether classified for tax purposes as investors or traders, don’t have to pay
the self-employment tax on their trading income. Isn’t that great?
Well, maybe, maybe not. The self-employment tax, the bane of many an
independent business person, is a contribution to the Social Security fund.
(Employees pay half of the contribution, and the employer pays the other
half. The self-employed have to pay the whole thing.)
The problem is that if you don’t have earned income, you are not paying
into Social Security. If you are not paying into Social Security, you may not be
eligible for retirement benefits. To collect benefits, you have to have paid in 40
credits, and you can earn a maximum of four credits per year. Most employees
do this easily, but if you’ve taken time off work or have a long history of work
as an independent investor, you may not have paid enough in.

==================================================

251
Chapter 15: Taxes for Traders
Any Social Security benefits you do collect are based on the 35 years of highest
earned income over your work history. Your years of independent trading show
up as years with zero earned income, which may hurt your ultimate benefit.
The Social Security Administration has a handy online calculator, www.social
security.gov/planners/calculators.htm, which can help you determine
whether day trading makes sense for you right now, given the possible effect on
your Social Security benefits.
Investment income
Investment income is your total income from property held for investment
before any deductions. It includes interest, dividends, annuities, and royalties.
Investment income does not include net capital gains, unless you choose to
include them. Do you want to include them? Well, read the next section.
Other than net capital gains, which you may or may not decide to include,
most day traders have very little investment income for tax purposes.
Capital gains and losses
A capital gain is the profit you make when you buy low and sell high — the
aim of day trading. The opposite of a capital gain is a capital loss, which
happens when you sell an asset for less than you paid for it. Investors can
offset some of their capital gains with some of their capital losses to reduce
their tax burden.
Frequent traders have many capital gains and losses, though, and they may
very well run afoul of complicated IRS rules about capital gains taxation. Day
traders get tripped up by capital gain and loss problems all the time. When
designing your trading strategy, think long and hard about how much pain
taxes may cause. The financial world is filled with horror stories of people
who thought they found a clever angle on making big profits, only to discover
at tax time that their tax liability was greater than their profit. In the real
world, taxes matter.
Capital gains come in two flavors: short term and long term. You’re charged
a low rate (the current rate is 15 percent) on long-term capital gains, which
right now is defined as the gain on assets held for more than one year. Short-
term capital gains, which are those made on any asset held for one year or

Part III: Necessities and Niceties for Successful Day Trading
Calculating capital gains and losses: Covering all your basis
Capital gains and losses are calculated using a security’s basis, which may
or may not be the same as the price that you paid for it or sold it at. Some
expenses, such as commissions or disallowed wash-sale losses (both of
which are discussed later in this chapter), are added to the cost of the
security, and that can reduce the amount of your taxable gain or increase
the amount of your deductible loss.
For example, if you bought 100 shares of stock at $50 per share and a $0.03
per share commission, your basis would be $5,003 — the $5,000 you paid for
the stock and the $3 you paid in commission.
Understanding the wash-sale rule
Suppose you love LMNO Company, but the price of the shares is down from
what it was when you purchased them. You’d like to get that loss on your
taxes, so you sell the stock, and then you buy it back at the lower price. You
get your tax deduction and still keep the stock. How excellent is that?
It’s too excellent to be true. This trick is called a wash sale, and the IRS does
not count the loss. The wash-sale rule was designed to keep long-term inves-
tors from playing cute with their taxes, but it has the effect of creating a ruin-
ous tax situation for naïve day traders.
Seeing the rule in action
Under the wash-sale rule, you cannot deduct a loss if you have both a gain and
a loss in the same security within a 61-day period. (That’s calendar days, not
trading days, so weekends and holidays count.) However, you can add the dis-
allowed loss to the basis of your security.
Here’s an example to illustrate. On Tuesday, you bought 100 shares of LMNO
at $34.60. LMNO announced terrible earnings, and the stock promptly
dropped to $29.32, and you sold all 100 shares for a loss of $528. Later in the
afternoon, you noticed that the stock had bottomed and looked like it might
trend up, so you bought another 100 shares at $28.75 and resold them an
hour later at $29.25, closing out your position for the day. The second trade
had a profit of $50. You had a net loss of $478 (the $528 loss plus the $50
profit). Here’s how this works out tax-wise: The IRS disallows the $528 loss
and lets you show only a profit of $50. But it lets you add the $528 loss to the
basis of your replacement shares, so instead of spending $2,875 (100 shares
times $28.75), for tax purposes, you spent $3,403 ($2,875 plus $528), which
means that the second trade caused you to lose the $478 that you added
back. On a net basis, you get to record your loss. The basis addition lets you
work off your wash-sale losses eventually, assuming that you keep careful
records and have more winning trades than losing ones in any one security.

Chapter 15: Taxes for Traders
To make the calculations easier, several different tax-software packages can
download trade data from your brokerage account to keep track of your tax
situation. One to check out is TradeLog, www.armencomp.com/tradelog.
Even if you hire someone to do your taxes, tracking your potential liabilities
as you trade can help you avoid costly mistakes.
The wash-sale rule applies to substantially similar securities. LMNO stock
and LMNO options are considered to be substantially similar, so you can’t
get around the rule by varying securities on the same underlying asset.
LMNO shares and shares of its closest competitor, PQRS, would probably
not be considered substantially similar, so you can trade within a given
industry to help avoid wash-sale problems.
Getting around the wash-sale rule
At an extreme, the wash-sale rule can mean that traders who are in and out of
the same securities over and over may be taxed on all their winning trades,
without being able to subtract their losing trades for tax purposes. If your
winning trades gained $300,000, and your losing trades cost you $200,000, you
cleared $100,000 — but the IRS may tax you on the $300,000. Ouch!
There are ways around the wash-sale rule. The obvious solution is to qualify
as a trader for IRS purposes and then take the mark-to-market accounting elec-
tion (covered in the section “Mark-to-market accounting”). Other methods for
avoiding the wash-sale rule include trading a given security only once every 60
calendar days and doing all your trading within a qualified retirement account
such as an IRA (also discussed later in this chapter). Some securities are han-
dled differently. Futures contracts are considered to generate investment
income and losses, not capital gains, and so they are not covered by the wash-
sale rule, which makes them a popular alternative for day traders. Profits on
options contracts are 60 percent long-term capital gains and 40 percent short-
term capital gains, which reduce the wash-sale rule effect.
If you have any more clever ideas about how you can make money without
taking a tax hit, be sure to run them through an experienced tax pro first.
Miscellaneous income
Miscellaneous income is money that you received that wasn’t earning income,
investment income, or capital gains. This kind of income is often payment
received in the course of a business or trade. As a freelancer, most of my
income is reported to the IRS in the miscellaneous category. Anyone who
pays me for my services has to send me Form 1099-MISC at the end of the
year, with a copy going to the IRS, to help the agency track my earnings.

==================================================

254
Part III: Necessities and Niceties for Successful Day Trading
Some proprietary traders that provide services for day traders (covered in
Chapter 11) report your profits and losses on Form1099-MISC. Miscellaneous
income is handled as self-employment income and must be reported.
Tracking Your Investment Expenses
Day traders have expenses. They buy computer equipment, subscribe to
research services, pay trading commissions, and hire accountants to prepare
their taxes. It adds up, and the tax code recognizes that. That’s why day
traders can deduct many of their costs from their income taxes. In this
section, I go through some of what you can deduct.
You can make your life much easier by keeping track of your expenses as you
incur them. You can keep these records in a notebook, in a spreadsheet, or
through personal finance software such as Quicken or Microsoft Money.
Qualified and deductible expenses
You can deduct investment expenses as miscellaneous itemized deductions
on Schedule A of Form 1040 as long as these expenses are ordinary, neces-
sary, directly related to the taxable income produced, and used to produce or
collect income or manage property held for producing income.
Clerical, legal, and accounting fees
You may use the services of a lawyer to help you get set up, and you will
almost definitely want to use an accountant who understands investment
expenses to help you evaluate your trading strategy and prepare your state
and federal income tax returns each year. There’s good news here: You can
deduct attorney and accounting fees related to your investment income. If
your trading operation gets big enough that you hire clerical help to keep
track of all those trade confirmations, you can deduct that cost, too.
Office expenses
If you do your day trading from an outside office, you can deduct the rent and
related expenses. You can deduct the expenses of a home office, too, as long
as you use it regularly and exclusively for business. If your trading room is
also the guest room, it doesn’t count.
Whether or not you deduct your office, you can deduct certain office
expenses for equipment and supplies used in your business. You can usually
write off roughly $100,000 in computers, desks, chairs, and the like if you use
them for trading more than half of the time. (The limits change every year.)

255
Chapter 15: Taxes for Traders
To get the deduction, you have to spend the money first, and your expenses
don’t reduce your taxes dollar-for-dollar. If you are in the 28 percent tax
bracket, then each dollar you spend on qualified expenses reduces your taxes
by $0.28. In other words, don’t go crazy at the office-supply store just because
you get a tax deduction. It may be helpful to think of deductible expenses as
discounts, because in the end that’s more or less what they are.
Investment counsel and advice
The IRS allows you to deduct fees paid for counsel and advice about invest-
ments that produce taxable income. This advice includes books, magazines,
newspapers, and research services that help you refine your trading strategy.
It also includes anything you may pay for investment advisory services, such
as trade coaching or analysis.
By the way, you can probably deduct what you paid for Day Trading For
Dummies. Did you save the receipt?
Safe-deposit box rent
Have a safe-deposit box down at the bank? You can deduct the rent on it if
you use it to store investment-related documents. If you also keep jewelry
that you inherited and never wear or other personal items in the same box,
you can only deduct part of the rent.
Investment interest
If you borrow money as part of your strategy, and most day traders do, you
can deduct the interest paid on those loans as long as it is not from a home
mortgage (because that interest is already deductible) and as long as you
are not subject to other limitations set forth in the IRS code, such as the
Alternative Minimum Tax. There’s always a catch, isn’t there? In most cases,
the catch is margin interest (see Chapter 9 for more information on margin).
For most day traders, margin interest is relatively small because few day trad-
ers borrow money for more than a few hours at a time.
If you borrow money against your account for anything other than investing or
trading, you can’t deduct the interest. And yes, most brokerage firms let you
take out margin for your own general spending, as a way to let you stay in the
market and still get cash.
State income taxes
If you itemize your deductions, you can deduct, as taxes, state income taxes
on interest income that is exempt from federal income tax. But you cannot
deduct, as either taxes or investment expenses, state income taxes on other
exempt income. In most cases, exempt income is related to government bond
transactions, and few day traders work in those markets.

Part III: Necessities and Niceties for Successful Day Trading
The 50 states all have different rules about taxation of investment income.
Some states with little or no tax on earned income handle investment income
differently. Because there are so many different issues, state taxation is
beyond the scope of this book. Check with your state revenue department
and a state-savvy tax expert to see what you need to know where you live.
What you can’t deduct
As you day trade, you’ll probably incur expenses that can’t be deducted from
your taxes. Disappointing, I know, but if you know what these nondeductible
expenses are upfront, you can plan accordingly.
What? I can’t deduct commissions?
Every time you make a trade, you have to pay a commission to your broker.
It may be small, just a few cents per share or a few dollars per trade, but you
have to pay it. And you can’t deduct that cost.
Before you splutter in outrage, read this: You can’t deduct it, but you can add
it to cost and subtract it from the proceeds of your trade. Here’s an example:
You buy 100 shares of Microsoft at $29.40 per share, paying a $6.00 commis-
sion on the trade. Your total cost for IRS purposes is ($29.40 × 100) + $6.00,
which equals $2,946. Later in the day, you sell all 100 shares for $30.00 per
share at a $6.00 commission, so your total proceeds for the deal are ($30.00 ×
100) – $6.00, or $2,994. Your total profit for tax purposes is $2,994 – $2,946, or
$48.00.
Including the commission in the basis of your trade works like a deduction in
terms of the amount of tax you pay, but because it’s not a deduction, it’s not
subject to the limitations that affect the deductibility of other expenses.
If your state charges transfer taxes on securities, they are handled the same
way as commissions.
Attending stockholders’ meetings
Companies hold annual meetings for their shareholders, usually at or near
the company headquarters. Sometimes these meetings are deathly dull: The
board of directors sits around a conference room in a law office and goes
through a boilerplate agenda with nothing to discuss. Others are extrava-
ganzas where the company shows off new products, showcases major
accomplishments, and takes questions from anyone in attendance. And a few
involve contentious issues that can lead to protests and fighting, which is
entertaining to watch if you aren’t directly affected.



==================================================
                     PAGE 273                     
==================================================

257
Chapter 15: Taxes for Traders
For long-term investors, these meetings can offer valuable insights on a
company’s prospects. Day traders probably wouldn’t find them very useful,
and it’s just as well, because the IRS won’t let anyone deduct the costs of
transportation, hotel stays, meals, and other expenses that may be involved
in attending a stockholders’ meeting.
Attending investment seminars
The financial-services industry offers all kinds of conventions, cruises, and
seminars for day traders. You can spend your days attending training seminars
instead of actually trading, if you’re so inclined. You’re welcome to go to these,
and in many cases, you should. You may learn things that would help you
trade more effectively. However, you can’t deduct the costs. Bummer.
Although you can’t deduct the costs of attending seminars, you can deduct
the costs of investment counsel and advisory services. Some seminars may
qualify as investment advice. These idiosyncrasies are why you need an
experienced tax adviser to help you.
Did you notice that two of the nondeductible expense categories have the
potential to involve travel? The IRS doesn’t want people buying ten shares of
Hawaiian Electric Industries stock and then trying to write off a trip to the
company’s annual meeting in Honolulu, nor does it consider cruises that
happen to include a talk by the author of a book on investing to be bona fide
investment counsel. It sees these activities as vacations, and vacations are not
tax deductible. (Of course, if an author of an investment book happened to be
on such a cruise, that may be a deductible cost for book promotion. Most
likely. Um, not like I know any authors of investment books who may have
looked into this or anything.)
Naturally, there are limitations!
You didn’t think the IRS would let you take all your deductions automatically,
did you? Of course not. Your deductions may be limited, especially if you
don’t meet the IRS definition of trader.
At-risk rules
The IRS says that your loss is limited by the amount of property you contribute
to your investing activities, including money you borrow. In most cases, day
trading losses meet the risk definitions, but if you pursue a naked trading
strategy that causes you to lose more than your initial investment, you may
fall into this category.

Part III: Necessities and Niceties for Successful Day Trading
Passive activity losses and credits
The IRS defines a passive activity as an investment where the investor does
not play an active role but does make money. You can deduct passive activity
losses only up to the amount of your passive activity income, and you can
use credits from passive activity losses only against tax on the income from
passive activities. Day trading is generally considered to be active, because
you are materially participating, but if you are generating passive losses from
other investment activities, you probably won’t be able to use them to offset
your day-trading gains.
Interest expense limitations
The IRS allows you to deduct investment interest up to the amount of your
net investment income, which is your investment income less all your
allowable deductible expenses except for interest. If you lost money trading,
you can’t use the interest deduction to reduce your taxes. What you can do,
though, is carry the undeducted investment interest into next year and
use it to reduce your taxes on those profits.
You also can’t deduct interest expenses on straddles. A straddle is an options
strategy that involves buying both a put option and a call option on the same
stock with the same strike price and expiration date. In most cases, the
nondeductible interest and related carrying charges are added to the basis of
the straddle (just as commissions are — see the earlier section “Calculating
capital gains and losses: Covering all your basis”).
Two percent limit
If you do not qualify as a trader to the IRS, you can deduct investment
expenses and other miscellaneous itemized deductions only if they add
up to more than 2 percent of your adjusted gross income.
Top Secret Tax Information for
IRS-Qualified Traders Only
If you meet the IRS qualifications for being a trader (see the earlier section
“Stock trading”), you can avoid some of the tax headaches faced by people
who trade but are not considered by the taxman to be traders. If you trade as
your job, make thousands of trades a year, and rarely hold any position for
more than a day, then you can fill out something called Form 3115, Application
for Change in Accounting Method, and tell the IRS that you want to use the
mark-to-market election in calculating your capital gains and losses. Form 3115
isn’t an easy form to fill out, so you should have a professional do it for you.



==================================================
                     PAGE 275                     
==================================================

259
Chapter 15: Taxes for Traders
The form has to be submitted with your prior year’s tax return. If you want
to use mark-to-market accounting in 2012, for example, you need to submit
Form 3115 when you send your 2011 tax return in April 2012.
You can’t use the election in your first year of trading. You first have to prove
that you are a trader before you are allowed to get the tax benefits that go
with the title. Consider it an apprenticeship.
If you qualify for trader status, you receive two benefits: mark-to-market
accounting and increased expense deductions. I cover both in the following
sections.
Mark-to-market accounting
Under mark-to-market accounting, you no longer have to track capital gains.
Instead, you pretend to sell your portfolio at the end of the year and then
pretend to repurchase everything at the beginning of the new year so that all
capital gains fall into income.
Because day traders usually close all their positions at the end of the day
anyway, mark-to-market accounting may not seem like a big deal, but it is: In
effect, converting all capital gains to income means that your trades are no
longer subject to the wash-sale rule. For most day traders, this lowers taxes
and results in fewer paperwork hassles.
If you use mark-to-market accounting, you can no longer get the 15 percent
rate on any long-term capital gains from your trading activities. Unless you
work with listed options on market indexes, which are considered to show
profits that are 60 percent long-term capital gains and 40 percent short-term
capital gains, you may not have any long-term capital gains from your trading
activities.
Greater deductibility of business expenses
In general, the IRS allows investors to deduct business expenses only if these
expenses exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income. However, anyone who
gets to join the charmed circle of IRS-qualified traders gets to deduct 100
percent of expenses, regardless of their adjusted gross income. They get to
deduct all their investment interest, too.
One caveat, though: The IRS assumes that people are in the business of trading
because they are making money at it. If you lose money for three out of five years,
even if it’s because your expenses exceeded your investment profits rather than
due to trading losses, the IRS will probably kick you out of the club.

Other Important Tax Info: Forms
and Deadlines
Knowing what constitutes income, what expenses you can deduct, and what
special rules apply if the IRS considers you a qualified trader is all well and
good, but when it comes right down to it, you still need to know the more
mundane things like what tax forms to fill out and when they’re due. This
section has the details.
Using the right tax forms
Many of the differences in income and expenses discussed already in this
chapter make more sense when you think about how they are reported on
your income tax return. In this section, I give you the highlights of some of the
most exciting forms for the modern day trader. Note that they are different
for those who qualify as traders by IRS standards (refer to the earlier section
“Stock trading”) than for everyone else who day trades.
✓ Forms for qualified traders: If you make the mark-to-market election
on Form 3115 (refer to the section “Mark-to-market accounting”), you’re
considered to be in the business of trading. Business expenses for indi-
vidual tax filers are put on Schedule C of Form 1040, Profit or Loss from
Business. Then your trading gains and losses are recorded on Part II
of Form 4797. If you have any securities at the end of the year in your
trading account, pretend that they were sold on the last business day of
the year at current fair market value and then immediately reacquired.
✓ Forms for everyone else: Day traders who are not considered traders
by the IRS should itemize business deductions and investment interest
expenses on Schedule A of Form 1040. You should attach Form 4952
if you used it to figure your investment interest expense. You report
capital gains and losses from your trading on Schedule D of Form 1040,
subject to all the limits on losses.
Paying all year: The joy of estimated taxes
If you have been an employee for years and years, all your tax liabilities may
have been covered by your payroll tax deductions. The IRS likes it best that
way, because then it gets money all year round. Face it: the easier it is to pay,
the more likely you are to do it.



==================================================
                     PAGE 277                     
==================================================

261
Chapter 15: Taxes for Traders
People who are self-employed or who have significant earnings from invest-
ments and day trading may generate more income than can be covered from
payroll withholding. What you need to do is estimate your tax liability four
times a year and then write a check for those amounts. (Otherwise, you could
face a penalty at tax time.) Estimated taxes are paid on Form 1040 ES and are
due April 15, June 15, September 15, and January 15.
Using Self-Directed IRAs
Much of the tax hassle associated with day trading is eliminated if you trade
through a self-directed individual retirement account, or IRA. Most brokerage
firms can set them up for you and handle the necessary paperwork. Although
individuals can contribute only $5,000 per year ($6,000 for people older than
50), the money can be substantial for those who have been contributing for a
long time. Also, you can roll over money from an employer’s retirement plan,
such as a 401(k), into an IRA after you leave.
You don’t have to pay taxes in an IRA until you retire, and then withdrawals
are generally treated as ordinary income. For this reason, an IRA is a great
vehicle for day traders: You can post big gains, count all your losses, and
avoid wash-sale rules for trading within your IRA. It’s a sweet way to let your
profits accumulate and compound for years. Of course, there’s a catch: You
can’t sell short, you can’t use all options strategies, and your brokerage firm
may not want to clear funds through the IRA.
If you are a full-time trader, consider keeping your retirement fund completely
separate from your trading funds. That way, you can pay the bills in your
golden years without worrying about what happens every trading day. It’s a
way to reduce stress, plus many retirement funds have tax benefits that may
help the bottom line on your trading business.
You can’t withdraw money from an IRA account until you turn 59 ½. If you take
money out earlier, you pay a 10 percent tax penalty, and that offsets a lot of
the advantages. If you need income from your trading activities to cover your
living expenses before then, an IRA is probably not the best way to set up your
day-trading account.

But Did You Make Money?
Testing, Tracking, and
Evaluating Performance
In This Chapter
▶ Testing before you trade
▶ Tracking while you trade
▶ Evaluating performance after the trade
A
ny one trade involves a lot of variables: price bought, price sold, commis-
sions charged, volume traded, and amount of leverage used. And each of
these affects your overall performance. In the heat of a trading day, it can be
hard to juggle all these factors and determine just how well you did or didn’t do.
Performance calculation starts before you trade. You want to test your strat-
egies and see whether they work for you, which requires backtesting and
paper trading. You want to keep track of your trades in real time with the
help of a trading diary. And then, on a periodic basis (at least monthly), you
should review your progress to see how much money you’re making and
whether you need to change your strategy.
Before You Trade: Testing Your System
Performance measurement starts before the trading does. That’s because you
want to figure out how you’ll trade before you start working with real money.
Chapter 3 describes some of the different securities that can be traded on a daily
basis, whereas Chapters 6 through 11 cover some of the strategies that day trad-
ers use. After you figure out the combinations of securities and strategies you
want to use, you want to see whether they would have made you money in the
past. Then you should try them to see whether they still work now.

The happy news? You can do all this without risking a dime, except of course
for the money you may spend on backtesting and simulation software. You
knew there had to be a catch, right? Consider it an investment in the success
of your business.
Backtesting
In backtesting, a trader specifies the strategy that he or she would use and
then runs that strategy through a database of historic securities prices to see
whether it would have made money. The test includes assumptions about
commissions, leverage, and position size. The results give information on
returns, volatility, and win-loss ratios that you can use to refine a trading
strategy and implement it well.
Starting with a hypothesis
What trades do you want to do? After you figure out what and how to trade,
you can start setting forth what your strategy will be. Will you look for high-
momentum, small-cap stocks? Seek price changes related to news events
in agricultural commodities? Ride large-cap stocks within their ranges?
Arbitrage stock index futures and their options?
After you do your research, you can lay out your strategy as a hypothesis,
which may be something like this: “High-momentum, small-cap stocks tend
to close up for the day, so I can buy them in the morning and make money
selling them in the afternoon.” Or this: “News events take at least half an
hour to affect corn prices, so I can buy or sell on the news and make a
profit.” With this statement, you can move on to the test to see whether
your hypothesis holds.
One of the most valuable parts about backtesting is that you have to be very
specific about what your trading rule is. Computers cannot understand vague
instructions, and if you find that your trading strategy is too complicated to
write out and set into a backtesting program, it’s probably too complicated for
you to follow.
Running the test
Say you start with something simple: Maybe you have reason to think that
pharmaceutical companies that are moving down in price on decreasing
volume will turn and close up for the day. The first thing you do is enter that
into the software: the industry group and the buy pattern that you’re looking
for. The results will show whether your hunch is correct and how often and
for what time periods.

Chapter 16: Testing, Tracking, and Evaluating Performance
If you like what you see, you can add more variables. What happens if you
add leverage (use borrowed money) in your trades? Leverage increases your
risk of loss, but it also increases your potential return. How does that affect
your trade? Suppose you increase the size of your trades, making fewer
but larger ones. Would that help you make more money or less? By playing
around with the system, you can get a good sense of the best way to make
money with your trade ideas. You can also get a sense of when your rule
won’t work, which can help you avoid problems.
If your strategy doesn’t work in testing, you want to ask yourself why
not. Is your theory not as good as you thought, or are the markets
different now? And if they are different now, how are they different? Unless
you can answer those questions, you’re just engaging in wishful think-
ing, and wishful thinking will destroy any trader, no matter what the test
results may be.
Most backtesting software allows for optimization, which means that it can
come up with the leverage, position, holding period, and other parameters
that will generate the best risk-adjusted return given the data on hand. You
can then compare this result to your trading style and your capital position
to see whether it works.
Backtesting is subject to something that traders call over-optimization, math-
ematicians call curve-fitting, and analysts call data mining. All these terms
mean that the person performing the test looks at a past time where the
market performed well and then identifies all the variables and specifica-
tions that generated that performance. Although over-optimization sounds
great, what often happens is that the test generates a model that includes
unnecessary variables and that makes no logical sense in practice. If you
find a strategy that works when the stock closes up one day, down two
days, then up a third day, followed by four down days when it hits an intra-
day high, you probably haven’t made an amazing discovery; you’ve just fit
the curve.
People often have elaborate ideas of how the random shuffle feature works
on their MP3 players. Ask and they’ll give you their own interesting theory for
how certain types of songs show up more often than others, how songs with
similar titles seem to be played together, and other patterns that they are sure
must be there. Why? Because human beings have evolved to see patterns,
even when no pattern exists. It’s the same with the market. It’s entirely possi-
ble that, although the results of your test look great, they only show a random
event that happened to work once. That’s why you need to keep testing, even
after you start trading.

Comparing the results with market cycles
The markets change every day in response to new regulations, interest rate
fluctuations, economic conditions, nasty world events, and run-of-the-mill
news events. (It’s like the joke about weather: If you don’t like it now, wait a
minute, and it’ll change.) Different securities and strategies do better in some
market climates than in others.
When you backtest, be sure to do so over a long enough period of time so
that you can see how your strategy would work over different market condi-
tions. Here are some things to check:
✓ How did the strategy do in periods of inflation? Economic growth? High
interest rates? Low interest rates?
✓ What was happening in the markets during the time that the strategy
worked best? What was happening when it worked worst? How likely is
either of those to happen again?
✓ How does market volatility affect the strategy? Is the security more vola-
tile than the market, less volatile, or does it seem to be removed from
the market?
✓ Have major changes occurred in the sector over the period of the test?
Examples of these types of changes include new technologies that
increase demand for certain commodities or changes in regulation that
make industries obsolete. Does this mean that past performance still
applies?
✓ Have there been changes in the way that the security trades? For
example, the bulk of trading in most commodities used to take place in
open-outcry trading pits. Now, trading is almost entirely electronic. How
do your test results look given current trading technologies?
In the capital assets pricing model, which is a key part of academic finance
theory, the market risk is known as beta. The value that a portfolio manager
adds to investment performance is known as alpha. In the long run, conven-
tional finance theory says that the return on a diversified portfolio comes
from beta; alpha doesn’t exist, so investors can’t beat the market in the long
run. In the short run, where day traders play, this relationship may not be so
strong.
Remember the maximum maxim in finance: Past performance is not indicative
of future results. A strategy may test perfectly, but that doesn’t mean it will
continue to work. Backtesting is an important step to successful day trading,
but it is only one step.

Chapter 16: Testing, Tracking, and Evaluating Performance
Simulation trading
With a backtested strategy in hand, you may be tempted to start putting real
money on the line. Don’t, at least not yet. Start with what is known variously
as ghost trading, paper trading, and simulation trading. Sit down in front of your
computer screen and start watching the price quotes. When you see your ideal
entry point, write it down. When you see your exit point, write it down. (Or
use the simulation functions available from many brokers to save yourself the
paper and pencil work.) Do exactly what you plan to do with real money, just
don’t use the money. Then figure out what your performance would be.
If your strategy doesn’t generate a lot of trades, you can probably keep track
with a pen and paper and then enter the data into a spreadsheet to calculate
the effects of commissions and leverage and to analyze the performance on
both a percentage and a win-loss basis. How does it look?
For more complex strategies that involve a large number of trades on a large
number of securities, you may want to use a trading-simulation software pack-
age. These packages mimic trading software (and are usually added features to
trading software packages; see Chapters 11 and 12 for more information). They
let you enter the size of your order, let you use leverage, and tell you whether
your trade can be executed given current market conditions.
Markets are affected by supply and demand, and your trade can affect that,
which is the biggest drawback of simulation trading: It’s difficult to take the
market effects of your trade into account in any reliable way, especially if
you’ll be trading large positions in thinly traded markets.
The results of your trading simulation can help you refine your trading
strategy further. Does it work in current market conditions? Are you able to
identify entry and exit points? Can you execute enough trades to make your
day-trading efforts financially worthwhile? Do you want to refine your
strategy some more, or are you ready to go with it?
Your tests won’t guarantee your results, and they won’t show you how you’ll
react under the real pressure of real markets and real money. However, if
your system doesn’t work well under perfect conditions, it is unlikely to do
better in actual conditions.
Finding a suitable strategy may take a long time. Some traders report spending
months finding a strategy they felt comfortable using. Day trading is a busi-
ness like any other. Consider this part of the market research and education
process that you need to go through, just as you’d spend time doing research
before opening a store or training for a new career. Be patient. It’s better to do
good simulation for months than to lose thousands of real dollars in hours.

Backtesting and simulation software
Several vendors have risen to meet the challenge of backtesting, and it is
becoming standard on more and more trading platforms. The list in this sec-
tion is by no means exhaustive, nor is it an endorsement of their services. It’s
just a good place for you to start your research.
If you’re just getting started with trading, you may want to try a cheaper pack-
age just to see how backtesting and simulation works. If you already have an
account with a brokerage firm, check to see whether backtesting and simula-
tion are among the services offered. You can always move up to a more
sophisticated backtesting package as your needs change or if you start
pursuing exotic strategies with unusual securities.
The more sophisticated the package, the pricier it is. If you have the pro-
gramming expertise or if your strategy is not well represented in current
backtesting programs, you may want to create your own system. Many
software-savvy day traders write programs using Excel’s Visual Basic func-
tions, allowing them to create custom tests that they then run against price
databases to backtest strategies.
AmiBroker
AmiBroker (www.amibroker.com) offers a robust backtesting service at a
relatively low price. For that reason, it’s a popular choice with people who
are getting started in day trading and who don’t have more expensive ser-
vices. It also allows users to make sophisticated technical charts that they
can use to monitor the markets. One drawback is that you may have to pay
extra for the market-price-quote data, depending on what securities and time
periods you want to test.
Investor/RT
Developed by a company called Linn Software (www.linnsoft.com),
Investor/RT allows you to develop your own tests and create your own pro-
grams. It has packages for Macs, which makes it popular with traders who
prefer Apple computers. Its users tend to be sophisticated about their trading
systems and backtesting requirements; this software isn’t really for beginners.
MetaStock
As the name implies, MetaStock (www.metastock.com) is designed for trad-
ers who work in stocks, although a MetaStock package is available especially
for currency traders, and the regular packages include capabilities for futures
and commodities traders. It defines traders as end-of-day (those who make
decisions about trading tomorrow based on numbers at the end of today’s

trading) and as real-time (those who make decisions during the trading day).
Most day traders are real-time traders. The company is owned by Thomson
Reuters, a major financial-information services company.
NinjaTrader
NinjaTrader (www.ninjatrader.com) is a popular software package used
for managing and programming traders. It includes great backtesting capabili-
ties, too. The platform works with many different brokerage firms, for a fee,
but the charting and trade testing capabilities are free. That may be why it’s
become one of the most popular services for backtesting.
OptionVue
If you trade options, you may want to check out OptionVue (www.
optionvue.com), which offers a range of analytical tools on the options
markets. The software’s BackTrader module, an add-on feature, helps you
learn more about options markets, test new strategies, and examine relation-
ships between options and the underlying stocks — really useful information
for people working in equity markets.
Tradecision
Tradecision’s (www.tradecision.com) trade-analysis software package
is a little pricier than most retail trading alternatives, but it offers more
advanced capabilities, including an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses
of different trading rules. It can incorporate advanced money-management
techniques and artificial intelligence to develop more predictions about per-
formance in different market conditions. The system may be overkill for most
new day traders, but it can come in handy for some.
TradeStation
TradeStation (www.tradestation.com) is an online broker that specializes
in services for day traders. Its strategy testing service lets you specify dif-
ferent trading parameters, and then it shows you where these trades would
have taken place in the past, using price charts. That way, you can see what
would have happened, which is helpful if you’re good at technical analysis.
It also generates a report of the strategy, showing dollar, percentage, and
win-loss performance over different time periods. It doesn’t have a trade-
simulation feature.
Trading Blox
The Trading Blox software system (www.tradingblox.com) was
developed by professional traders who needed to test their own theories
and who didn’t want to do a lot of programming to do it. It comes in three

versions (and price levels), ranging from basic to sophisticated, and the com-
pany boasts that it works with some commercial trading firms. Of course,
some of its capabilities may be more than you need when you’re starting out.
During the Day: Tracking Your Trades
After you put your strategy to work during the trading day, it’s easy to let
the energy and emotion overtake you. You get sloppy and stop keeping
track of what’s happening. And that’s not good. Day trading is not a video
game; it’s a job. Keeping careful records helps you identify not only how
well you follow your strategy but also ways to refine it. These records can
also show you how successful your trading is, and it makes your life a lot
easier when tax time comes around. (Refer to Chapter 15 for more informa-
tion on what the friendly folks at the IRS expect from traders, besides a cut
of their profits.)
Setting up your spreadsheet
The easiest way to get started tracking your trades is with a spreadsheet
software program such as Microsoft Excel. Set up columns for the asset being
purchased, the time of the trade, the price, the quantity purchased, and
the commission. Then set up similar columns to show what happens when
the position is closed out. Finally, calculate your performance based on the
change in the security’s price and the dollars and percentage return on your
trade. Figure 16-1 gives you an example.

Some brokerage firms and trading platforms automatically store your trade
data for analysis. You can then download the data into your own spreadsheet
or work with it in your trading software, making analysis simple. If you make
too many trades to keep track of manually, then this feature will be especially
important to you.
Pulling everything into a profit and

If you refer to the bottom of Figure 16-1, you see some quick summary sta-
tistics on how the day’s trading went: trading profits net of commissions,
trading profits as a percentage of trading capital, and the ratio of winning
to losing transactions. This information should be transferred into another
spreadsheet so that you can track your ongoing success. Figure 16-2 shows
an example of a profit and loss spreadsheet.

In addition to the increase in your assets, you want to track your volatility,
which is how much your gains and losses can fluctuate. Volatility is an impor-
tant measure of risk, especially if your trading strategy relies on leverage (see
Chapter 9 for more information on that).
Reviewing types of return
The investment performance calculation starts by dividing returns into differ-
ent categories: income, short-term capital gains, and long-term capital gains.
Although almost all a day trader’s gains come from short-term capital gains, I
go over the definitions of each so that you know the differences.
Income
When investors talk about income returns, they mean regular payments from
their investments, usually in the form of dividends from stock or interest pay-
ments on bonds. As a day trader, you may earn income on the cash balance
in your brokerage account but probably not from your trading activities.
Capital gains
A capital gain is the price appreciation in an asset — a stock, a bond, a house,
or whatever it is that you’re investing in. You buy it at one price, sell it at
another, and the difference is a capital gain. (Unless, of course, you sell the
asset for less than you paid, and then you have a capital loss.)
For tax purposes, capital gains are classified as either long-term or short-
term. Under the current tax law, any capital gain on an asset held for less
than one year is considered to be a short-term gain, and if the asset is owned
for one year or more before it’s sold, then it’s considered to be a long-term
capital gain. The difference isn’t semantic; long-term capital gains are taxed
at lower rates than short-term capital gains. You can read all about that and
then some in Chapter 15.
Income in tax terms is different from income in financial terms. Much of what
an investor would consider to be a capital gain, such as the short-term capital
gains that day traders generate, the IRS considers to be income.
Calculating returns
Give someone with a numerical bent a list of numbers and a calculator, and
she can some up with several different relationships between the numbers.
After the asset values for each time period have been determined, rates of
return can be calculated. But how? And over how long a time period? The
process gets a little more complicated because money is coming in and going
out while the asset values move up and down. The following sections outline
different calculations you can use to figure out your investment returns.



==================================================

Chapter 16: Testing, Tracking, and Evaluating Performance
Calculating compound average rate of return (CAGR)
The most common way to calculate investment returns is to use a time-
weighted average. This method is perfect for traders who start with one pool
of money and don’t add to it or take money out. This is also called the com-
pound average rate of return (CAGR). If you are looking at only one month or
one year, it’s a simple percentage. To calculate performance on a percentage
basis, you use this equation:
EOY −BOY
BOY
EOY represents the end of year asset value, and BOY represents the begin-
ning of year value. The result is the percentage return for one year, and to
calculate it, you use simple arithmetic.
Now if you want to look at your return over a period of several years, you
need to look at the compound return rather than the simple return for each
year. The compound return shows you how your investment is growing. You
are getting returns on top of returns, and that’s a good thing. But the math
gets a little complicated because now you have to use the root function on
your calculator. The equation for compound annual growth looks like this:
EOP
√N −1
BOP
EOP represents the end of the total time period, BOP represents the beginning
of the total time period, and N is the number of years that you’re looking at.
The basic percentage rate of return is great; it’s an accurate, intuitive mea-
sure of how much gain you’re generating from your trading activities. As long
as you don’t take any money out of your trading account or put any money
into it, you’re set.
Calculating performance when you make deposits and withdrawals
You may be putting money into your account. Maybe you have a salaried job
and are day trading on the side, or maybe your spouse gives you a percent-
age of his income to add to your trading account. You may also be taking
money out of your day-trading account to cover your living expenses or to
put into other investment opportunities. All that money flowing into and out
of your account can really screw up your performance calculation. You need
a way to calculate the performance of your trading system without
considering the deposits and withdrawals to your trading account.
Here’s an example: You start day trading on January 1 with $100,000 in
your account. On May 1, your income tax refund from last year arrives, and

Part III: Necessities and Niceties for Successful Day Trading
you add $1,000 of the money to your account and start trading with it. On
December 1, you take out $5,000 to buy holiday presents. At the end of the
year, your account is worth $115,000. How did you do?
As a day trader, you have a few methods at your disposal for calculating your
performance when you make withdrawals and deposits:
✓ The Modified Dietz method loses a little accuracy but makes up for it
with simplicity.
✓ The time-weighted rate of return isolates investment and trading
performance from the rest of the account.
✓ The dollar-weighted rate of return has many flaws but gives a sense of
what the account holder has.
Read on to see the return that would be calculated using each of these
methods.
Modified Dietz method
The Modified Dietz method is related to the simple percent change formula,
but it adjusts the beginning and ending period amounts for the cash inflows
and cash outflows. The equation for the Modified Dietz method looks like
this:
EOY −BOY −deposits+withdrawals
BOY +deposits−withdrawals
If you plug in the numbers from the example, you get
115,000−100,000−1,000+5,000
100,000+1,000−5,000
Do the math and you see that the result is 19.8 percent.
The advantage of the Modified Dietz method is that it’s so easy to do. You can
use it when you want a rough idea of how you are doing with your trading but
you don’t have the time to run a more detailed analysis. The key disadvan-
tage is that it doesn’t consider the timing of the deposits and withdrawals.
It would generate the same answer if you took out $5,000 in May and put in
$1,000 in December, even though the amount of money you would have to
trade between May 1 and December 1 would be very different.
Time-weighted rate of return
The time-weighted rate of return shows the investment performance as a per-
centage of the assets at hand to trade. This method is the standard of trader
evaluation, but the math is much more complicated than with the basic

Chapter 16: Testing, Tracking, and Evaluating Performance
percentage change or the Modified Dietz method. You need to calculate the
CAGR for each time period and then do a second calculation to incorporate
each of those over a longer period. Using the preceding example, you’d cal-
culate one return for the first four months of the year, another for the next
seven months, and then a third return for the month of December. These
three returns would then be multiplied to generate a return for the year.
The general equation you use to figure the time-weighted rate of return looks
like this:
√N 1+r 1+r 1+r … 1+r −1
( p1)( p2)( p3) ( pn)
N is the total number of time periods that you are looking at, and rpn is the
return for that particular time period. To make the calculations easier, you
can do it in a spreadsheet. Figure 16-4 shows the time-weighted return for
this example. As you can see, the result is 18.78 percent, a little below the
Modified Dietz return.

calculation.

If you plan on adding to or taking money out of your account, you can make
your return calculations much easier by setting a regular schedule and stick-
ing to it. Otherwise, you have to do calculations for fractional time periods. It’s
not impossible, but it’s kind of a hassle.
The time-weighted rate of return gives you the best sense of your trading per-
formance, and its precision more than offsets the complexity of the calcula-
tion. You want to look at this number when you are deciding whether to
change or refine your strategy.
Dollar-weighted returns
The dollar-weighted return, also called the money-weighted return, is the rate
that makes the net present value of a stream of numbers equal to zero. That
calculation is also called the internal rate of return or IRR, and it is used for
other things than just return calculations. You can use it to determine what

==================================================

the return is for a stream of numbers over time and to calculate returns when
you’re putting money into or taking money out of your trading account. And
if you have a financial calculator such as the Hewlett-PackardHP17BII+ or the
Texas Instruments BA2+, the calculations are pretty easy.
Ah, but there’s a catch! Although useful, the dollar-weighted method can mis-
state returns and occasionally shows nonsensical results if too many negative
returns appear in a series. And yes, day traders often have negative returns.
If you get a result showing a ridiculously large positive or a ridiculously small
negative return (like –15,989.9 percent, for example), you may want to try
another calculation.
Figure 16-5 shows the dollar-weighted rate of return using the same data used
in the two preceding examples.

rate of
return. Period Percentage Return: 9.00% 11.82% -2.54%
Annual Return: 12.10%
The result is 12.1 percent, lower than the other two examples because the
dollar-weighted return overstates the withdrawal and the loss in the last
month of the year. The withdrawals affect the account’s spending power,
offsetting the investment performance. But the overall account balance is up
more than 12.1 percent, even considering the deposit at the beginning of May.
The weight of the cash flows threw off this calculation.
Because of the problems with dollar-weighted returns, professional investors
who analyze investment returns usually prefer the time-weighted, compound
average approach. Still, the dollar-weighted return has some value, especially
for an investor who wants to know how the asset value has changed over
time. Because a day trader is usually both an investor and an account owner,
the dollar-weighted rate of return can show whether the investment perfor-
mance is affecting spending power. This measure is particularly useful if you
are trying to decide whether to continue day trading.
Just as you have alternatives in calculating your performance, so too does
anyone trying to sell you a trading system or training course. Ask questions
about the performance calculation method and how cash flows and expenses
are handled. The numbers may not look so great once you grade the math
behind them.

Chapter 16: Testing, Tracking, and Evaluating Performance
Determining the risk to your return
Now that you have return numbers from your profit and loss statements and
your return calculations, it’s time to perform black-belt performance jujitsu
and determine your risk levels. I’m not going to go into all of the many risk
and volatility measures out there, because believe me, the good editors of
the For Dummies books don’t want to proofread all the math. In fact, some
of these measures may be more math than you want to do. That’s okay. Even
if you look at just a few measures, you’ll have more information than if you
ignore them all.
Batting average — er, win-loss percentage
Baseball players are judged by how often they hit the ball. After all, they can’t
score until they get on base, and they can’t get on base without a hit or a
walk. The number of hits relative to the number of times at bat is the batting
average. It’s a simple, beautiful number.
Day traders often calculate their batting average, too, although they may
call it their win-loss percentage or win ratio. It’s the same: the number of
successful trades to the total number of trades. Not all trades have to work
out for you to make money, but the more often the trades work for you, the
better your overall performance is likely to be. If you have both good per-
formance and a high batting average, then your strategy may have less risk
than one that relies on just a handful of home run trades amidst a bunch of
strikeouts.
Standard deviation
Want something harder than your batting average? Turn to standard devia-
tion, which is tricky to calculate without a spreadsheet but forms the core of
many risk measures out there.
The standard deviation calculation starts with the average return over a
given time period. This is the expected return, the return that, on average,
you get if you stick with your trading strategy. But any given week, month,
or year, the return may be very different from what you expect. The more
likely you are to get what you expect, the less risk you take. Insured bank sav-
ings accounts pay a low interest rate, but the rate is guaranteed. Day trading
offers the potential for much higher returns but also the possibility that you
could lose everything any one month — especially if you can’t stick to your
trading discipline.
The explanation is a lot easier to understand after you take a gander at
Figure 16-6.

standard Step Five: Square root of the average of the

standard deviation 0.0383
As this figure shows, you calculate standard deviation through a series of
steps:
1. Take every return over the time period and then find the average. A
simple mean will do. Here, there are 12 months, so I added all 12 returns
and then divided by 12.
2. Subtract the average from each of the 12 returns. This calculation
shows how much any one return differs from the average, to give you a
sense of how much the returns can go back and forth.
3. Square the differences you found in Step 2 (multiply them by them-
selves) to get rid of the negative numbers. When you add those up, you
get a number known in statistics as the sum of the squares.
4. Find the average of the sum of the squares.
5. Calculate the square root of the average of the sum of the squares.
That square root from this step is the standard deviation, the magic
number you’re looking for.
Of course, you don’t have to do all of this math. Almost all trading software
calculates standard deviation automatically, but at least you now know where
the calculation comes from.
The higher the standard deviation, the riskier the strategy. This number can
help you determine how comfortable you are with different trading techniques
you may be backtesting, as well as whether you want to stick with your
current strategy.

Chapter 16: Testing, Tracking, and Evaluating Performance
In academic terms, risk is the likelihood of getting any return other than the
return you expect. To most normal human beings, there’s no risk in getting
more than you expect; the problem is in getting less of a return than you were
counting on. This is a key limitation of risk evaluation. Of course, a few peri-
ods of better-than-expected returns are often followed by a run of worse-than-
expected returns as performance reverts to the mean.
The truism that past performance is no indicator of future results applies to
risk as well as to return.
Using benchmarks to evaluate
your performance
To understand your performance numbers, you need one more step: what
your performance is relative to what else you could be doing with your
money. The following sections have the details.
Performance relative to an index
The most common way to think about investment performance is relative
to a market index. These are the measures of the overall market that are
quoted all the time in the news, such as the Standard & Poor’s 500 and the
Dow Jones Industrial Average. Not only are these widely watched, but many
mutual funds and futures contracts are designed to mimic their performance.
That means investors can always do at least as well as the index itself, if their
investment objectives call for exposure to that part of the broad investment
market.
One big problem is that day traders often look at the wrong index for the type
of investment that they have. They’ll compare the performance of trading in
agricultural commodities to the Standard & Poor’s 500 when a commodities
index would be a better measure. And the indexes assume that the assets in
question are held for the long haul rather than traded every few minutes or
every few hours.
If you aren’t sure what index to use, check a financial website such as Yahoo!
Finance (http://finance.yahoo.com/indices) or check out the Market
Lab section of Barron’s (www.barrons.com), a weekly financial publica-
tion put out by Dow Jones & Company, the same people who publish The
Wall Street Journal and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Both of these have
lengthy lists of different stock, bond, and commodity indexes covering the
United States and the world. You can find the one that best matches your pre-
ferred markets and use it to compare your performance.



==================================================

==================================================

282
Part III: Necessities and Niceties for Successful Day Trading
In some cases, your trading practices may overlap more than one index. If so,
pick the indexes that are appropriate and compare them only to those trades
that match. If you trade 40 percent currencies and 60 percent metals, then
you should create your own hybrid index that’s 40 percent currencies and 60
percent metals.
Performance relative to your time
In the earlier section “Pulling everything into a profit and loss statement,”
where I talk about tracking your trades and doing a profit and loss statement,
I say that you should calculate your hourly wage. There’s a reason for that.
Instead of day trading, you could put your money in a nice, simple index
mutual fund and take a regular job. If your hourly wage is less than what you
can earn elsewhere, you may want to consider doing just that.
Of course, there are benefits to working on your own that don’t often show
up in your bank account. I say this as someone who left finance to be a finan-
cial writer. If you enjoy day trading and if you make enough money to suit
your lifestyle, by all means, don’t let the relative numbers stop you.
Performance relative to other traders
You probably want to know how you’re doing relative to other people who
are trading. However, you’ll probably never know. No central repository of
trading returns exists (although wouldn’t it be interesting if the brokerage
firms or exchanges could report that?). Some academics have done studies of
day-trading returns, but they’re working with historic data stripped of
customer information.
On message boards and at get-togethers, you may hear other traders talk
about their returns. Take this information with an entire box of salt. Some
people lie. Others exaggerate or obfuscate. Someone who has average or
poor returns may want to lie to try to impress others, while those with great
returns may not want to call attention to their prowess.
Ignore whatever other traders tell you about their returns. If you are satisfied
with your performance relative to your risk and your time, nothing else matters.

t takes a special person to be a day trader — one who has quick reflexes, a
strong stomach, and a short-term perspective on the markets. Not every-
one’s meant to parcel out his or her workday a minute at a time. Most people
do better with a long-term perspective on their finances, looking to match their
investments with their goals and thinking about their investment performance
over months or years rather than right now.
But patient long-term investors can learn a thing or two from the frenetic day
trader, and that’s what this chapter is all about. Many day-trading techniques
can help swing traders, position traders, and investors — people who hold
positions for days, months, or even decades — improve their returns and
make smarter decisions when it comes time to buy or sell. In this chapter,
I cover some trading and analysis techniques used by day traders that can
help longer-term investors improve their returns. Then I discuss some ways
that long-term investors may want to add day trading to their list of tricks as
a way to achieve a better total return.
What Investors Can Learn from Traders
In theory, investors may be willing to wait forever to see great stock picks
play out, but in reality, they only have so much time and money. A company’s
stock may be ridiculously cheap, but the stock can languish a long time
before everyone else catches on and bids the price up. The investor who
buys and sells well can add a few extra dollars to his investment return, and
who doesn’t want that? In addition, some long-term investors will take a day-
trading flyer on a hot idea. Maybe a few will even want to give day trading a

try, especially for those securities they’ve followed long enough to know how
the market reacts to news and whether those reactions are appropriate. For a
long-term investor, given the time to test strategies and set limits, day trading
in known markets may result in some nice incremental short-term returns.
Investors who are interested in occasionally (or frequently) day trading
need to adopt not only a few key day-trading strategies but also the key
characteristics that make day traders successful.
Being disciplined
Successful day traders have an innate sense of discipline. They know when to
commit more money to a trade and when to cut their losses and close shop
for the day.
Unfortunately, a lot of long-term investors can get sloppy. They have done so
much research and committed so much time waiting for a position to work
that they often forget the cardinal rule of the trader: The market doesn’t
know that you’re in it. The stock doesn’t know you own it, so it’s not going to
reward your loyalty. Securities go up and down every day for no good reason,
and sometimes you are going to make a mistake and will have to cut your
losses. There’s no shame in that, as long as you learn from it.
Now, how can you get that discipline? By doing these things:
✓ Develop an investment and trading plan, covered in Chapter 2.
Although investing is probably not your primary occupation, you do
want to have in writing what your objectives are and how you plan to
meet them given other constraints: time, tax considerations, and risk
tolerance.
✓ Carefully evaluate your performance (covered in Chapter 16). Keep
a trading diary so that you know what you’re trading and why. Can you
find ways to improve? Are you making mistakes that can be avoided?
✓ Set up a sell rule. A quick way for an investor to improve her trading
discipline is to set up a sell rule, a rule that tells her when to cut her
losses and move on. For example, if a stock is down 20 percent from
where it was purchased or where it traded at the beginning of the year,
it may be time to sell, regardless of what you hope it will do.
Traders have to go through these exercises to survive. Investors often skip
these steps, but they shouldn’t.

Chapter 17: Day Trading for Investors
Dealing with breaking news and
breaking markets
One reason that the markets are so volatile is that they respond to news
events. Prices reflect information, changing when any little bit of information
comes into the market — even if the info is just that someone wants to buy and
someone wants to sell right now. The problem is that sometimes the market
participants don’t react in proportion to the news they receive. Good traders
have an almost innate ability to discern news that creates a buy from news that
creates a sell. (You can find out more about market indicators and strategies
in Chapter 8.) Sometimes traders want to go with the market, and sometimes
they want to go against it.
When your investment idea has been affected by a news announcement,
you need to consider how your position — and you — will react. After all,
no matter how long your time horizon and how careful your research, things
happen to companies: CEOs have heart attacks, major products are found to
be defective, financial statements turn out to be fraudulent, and so on. How
are you going to respond?
The first point is that you have to respond. The market doesn’t know your
position, and the market doesn’t care. (Have I mentioned that already?) You
need to assess the situation and decide what to do. Given the information, is
it time to buy, sell, or stay put? Holding your long-term position in the face of
long-term news is often okay, but that decision should be an active one, not a
fallback. The trick is to be objective, which isn’t easy when real dollars are
at stake.
Successful day traders are able to keep their emotions under control and keep
the market separate from the rest of their lives. Good investors should be able
to do the same. Chapter 14 has some ideas that may help.
When evaluating news, day traders look at how the news is different from
expectations. Investors can also consider how the news is different relative
to the known facts about the company to date. For example, suppose that
the Timely Timer Company is expected to report earnings of $0.10 per share.
Instead, the news hits the tape saying that earnings will be only $0.05 because
of accounting charges. The trader may see that the earnings are below expec-
tations and short the shares to play on the bad news. The investor may know
that the accounting charges were expected and quickly buy more shares
while the price is depressed. The fact that there is a way for a buyer and a
seller to match their differing needs is the whole reason that the financial
markets exist!

To a day trader, perception is reality. To a keen-eyed investor, the difference
between perception and reality may be an opportunity to make money.
Day traders have to think about the psychology of the market because
everything moves so quickly. Investors sometimes forget about psychology
because they can wait for logic to prevail. When it comes time to place a buy
or sell order, however, understanding the psychological climate that day can
give the investor a price advantage, and every bit of profit improvement goes
straight to the bottom line.
Day traders keep their sanity by closing out positions at the end of the day
so that they can get on with their lives until the next market opens. Investors,
on the other hand, may want to know what’s happening to their positions at
other times. Many brokerage firms offer mobile-phone alert services, which
I think are a terrible idea for a day trader but may not be a bad idea for an
investor.
Setting targets and limits
Good day traders set limits. They often place stop and limit orders to auto-
matically close out their positions when they reach a certain price level.
They have profit targets in mind and know how much they’re willing to risk in
the pursuit of those gains.
Good investors should set similar limits. It can be harder for them, because
they have often done so much research that they feel almost clairvoyant.
Why worry about the downside when the research shows that the stock has
to go up?
Well, the research may overlook certain realities. And even with thorough
analysis, things change. That’s why even the most ardent fundamentalist
needs to have a downside risk limit. In most cases, stop and limit orders are
bad ideas for a long-term investor because they force the sale of a security
during a short-term market fluctuation and force the sale when it’s really
a good time to buy more. Investors have a different risk profile than day
traders, so they need to manage risk differently — but they do still need to
manage it.
With a stop order, the broker buys or sells the security as soon as a pre-
determined price is met, even if the price quickly moves back to where it was
before the order took effect. A limit order is only executed if the security hits
the predetermined level, and it stays in effect only if the price is at that level
or lower (for a buy limit order) or at that level or higher (for a sell limit order).

==================================================

287
Chapter 17: Day Trading for Investors
Day traders close out their positions at the end of each day, so they rarely
review their limits. A swing trader or an investor, on the other hand, who
holds for a longer period of time, needs to review those limits frequently.
How much should a position move each month, quarter, or year before it’s
time to cover losses or cash out with a profit? How has the security changed
over time, and do the limits need to change with it?
When the position is working, an investor thinks of letting it ride forever.
But, alas, few investments work that long into the future, so the investor also
needs to think in term of relative performance. Has the time come to sell and
put the money into something else with greater potential?
When managing money, day traders usually think about maximizing return
while minimizing the risk of ruin. For an investor, the goal is maximizing
return relative to a list of long-term objectives, including a target for risk.
But because long-term objectives change, the portfolio has to as well. That
means that a position that has been working out fine may have to be changed
in order to meet the new portfolio goals. The discussion is starting to get
beyond the scope of this book, but the point remains: Like successful day
traders, successful investors have a plan for how they will allocate their
money among different investments, and they adjust it as necessary.
Although investing is a long-term proposition and lacks the frenzy of trading,
it is still an active endeavor. Instead of putting energy into buying and selling,
the investor puts it into monitoring.
Judging execution quality
Day traders rely on outstanding trade execution from their brokers. They
need to keep costs as low as possible in order to clear a profit from their
trading, especially because their profits are relatively small.
Investors may have a greater likelihood of making a profit, given that they are
waiting for a position to work out rather than closing it out every night. Even
then, better execution leads to better profits. The magnitude of the few extra
cents may be smaller relative to the entire profit, but it still counts.
Looking at total execution costs
Your broker makes money three ways. The first is on the commission charged
to make the trade. The second is on the bid-ask spread (also called the bid-
offer), which is the difference between the price that the broker buys the
security from customers and the price that the broker sells it to customers.



==================================================

==================================================

288
Part III: Necessities and Niceties for Successful Day Trading
The third is any price appreciation on the security between when the broker
acquired it and when the firm sold it to the customer. Because three sources of
profit are available, some brokers don’t even charge commission. But note that
the broker can still make money — lots of money — even without a commission.
When choosing a broker, consider total execution costs, not just commission.
Some brokers offering deep commission discounts make money from high
levels of trading volume, but others make their money from execution.
Improving execution
The broker has a few tricks for improving execution. The first is to invest
heavily in information systems that can route and match orders, because
even the slightest delay can make a difference if the markets are moving.
The second is to have a large enough customer base to be able to match
customer orders quickly. Third, and most important, is to decide that
execution is a strategic advantage it can use to keep customers happy.
Many brokerage firms would rather concentrate on research, financial
planning, customer service, or other offerings to keep customers happy
instead of offering excellent execution.
In general, a firm that offers low commissions and emphasizes its services
to active traders has better execution than a firm that emphasizes its full-
service research and advisory expertise. But there are exceptions, and in
some cases, the exceptions vary with account size.
Brokerage firms use several numbers to evaluate their execution, including
the following:
✓ Average execution speed: This is the amount of time it takes the firm to fill
the first share of an order. Firms also track — and sometimes disclose —
how long filling an entire order takes, on average.
✓ Price relative to National Best Bid or Offer: At any time, there is a
list of bid and ask prices in the market, and your broker may not have
the best spread. The National Best Bid or Offer is the best price in the
market. You may not be able to get this price for all sorts of reasons,
usually because of the number of shares you want to buy or sell. For
example, if the best bid is for 100 shares and you want to sell 500, you
won’t be able to get all of the order filled. Brokerage firms track and
report how close the price you received was to the best bid or offer at
the time.
✓ Price improvement: Most brokerage firms buy and sell securities for
their own accounts. In fact, working as a trader at a brokerage firm may
be a great alternative to day trading. Because the firm may own the
security or want it for its own account, it may give you a slightly better
price than what’s in the market.

==================================================

289
Chapter 17: Day Trading for Investors
✓ Average effective spread: This number measures how much the spread
between the bid and the offer differed from the National Best Bid or
Offer, on average. The lower the average effective spread, the better.
Brokerage firms have to disclose information monthly about the differences
between market orders and public price quotes and the size of effective
spreads in different securities. You can look up this info to help compare the
performance at different firms. Certainly, your results will vary based on what
types of securities you’re trading, what market conditions are like when you
are trading, and how big an account you have with the firm. But investigating
the averages for a brokerage firm can help long-term investors decide whether
changing firms to improve profits makes sense.
So what can you do to improve your execution? Here are three suggestions:
✓ Ask the brokerage firm for its policies. The firm should provide this
information, as well as give you some of its recent data, so that you can
decide whether the total value of the firm’s services matches the total
cost.
✓ Check the weekly “Electronic Trader” column in Barron’s as well as
the magazine’s annual review of online brokerage firms. Execution
cost is a key component of Barron’s evaluation.
✓ Update your own hardware and Internet connection so that they’re
as fast as possible. If you’re a day trader, having access to good data
is imperative (see Chapter 12 for more information on your equipment
needs). If you are not a day trader but actively manage your investment
account, you may want to consider an upgrade as well. A few seconds
can make a difference.
Applying Momentum
Momentum investors look for securities that are going up in price, especially
if accompanied by acceleration in underlying growth. In a sense, they are
looking for the same thing day traders are — a security that is going to move
big — but they have the expectation of making money over a longer period of
time. The thought is that a security starting to go up in price will keep going
up unless something dramatic happens to change it. In the meantime, plenty
of money can be made.
In momentum investing, instead of buying low and selling high, the goal is to
buy high and sell even higher.

==================================================

290
Part III: Necessities and Niceties for Successful Day Trading
Like most investors, a momentum investor starts with careful fundamental
analysis (described in Chapter 7), analyzing a security to determine what will
make it go up. Then the momentum investor looks for certain technical and
market indicators, similar to those described in Chapters 7 and 8 and used by
day traders. In addition, some momentum investors rely on chart services,
especially the Value Line and William O’Neil charts, to help them identify
securities that are likely to have momentum.
Earnings momentum
Earnings momentum is the province of the investor, not the trader. The
investor is looking at the earnings that a company reports every quarter
to see whether the earnings are going up at a faster rate, say from a steady
rate of 10 percent a year to 12, 13, or more. Such an increase often happens
because of a new technology or product that turns a decent company into
a hot property in the stock and options markets. If the earning growth rate
is accelerating, then the underlying price should go up at an accelerating
rate, too.
Day traders don’t look for earnings momentum, but they do look for price
momentum. The two are usually related.
Price momentum
When a security goes up in price, especially at a fast clip with strong demand
underneath it, it is said to have price momentum. Most day traders are looking
for price momentum in order to make a swift profit. Many long-term investors
should look for price momentum, too, in order to avoid being stuck with a
position for months before it starts to move. After all, patience pays, but it
pays even better if your money is working for you while you wait.
Many momentum traders don’t care why something is going up in price; they
only know that it is going up and that they can profit by being there for even
part of the ride. Following are some of the different indicators that these
traders look at:
✓ Relative strength: You can calculate relative strength in different ways,
discussed in Chapter 7, but the basic idea is that a security that’s going
up faster than the market as a whole is showing momentum and may be
a buy.
✓ Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD): This indicator
looks at how the average price of the security is changing over time.



==================================================
                     PAGE 307                     
==================================================

291
Chapter 17: Day Trading for Investors
Is the indicator staying relatively level, meaning that the price is moving
slowly back and forth, or is the indicator gradually going up, meaning
that the price is gradually going up, too? If you plot the moving average
against the actual price levels, a wide gap means that the security is
moving up or down faster than the average, and if it’s moving up, you’d
probably want to buy it. (Otherwise, consider shorting the security; you
can read more about that in Chapter 9.)
✓ Stochastics index: This index is the difference between the high and the
low price for a security over a given time period. Some analysts look at
days, some at weeks. The idea is that, if the difference is getting bigger,
it may be because the security is moving up or down in price at a faster
than normal rate, creating an opportunity for a momentum buyer.
At an extreme, momentum investing leads to bubbles, like the infamous dot-com
bubble in the late 1990s. People were buying the stocks because they were
going up, not because they necessarily thought that the businesses were worth
much. This run was fun while it lasted, but a lot of people lost a lot of money
when reality set in during March and April 2000. The same thing happened in
the real estate market. People were playing momentum when they were flipping
condominiums in Las Vegas in the first decade of the 21st century, but prices
couldn’t go up forever — and they didn’t.
For investors only: Momentum-research
systems
Many day traders rely on different research systems to help them identify buy
and sell opportunities in the course of a trading day. These systems usually
don’t work for an investor, simply because investors are less concerned about
short-term movements. They wouldn’t see the value in systems that scan the
market and identify short-term price discrepancies, for example.
However, many investors use their own research services to help identify
good buy and sell opportunities. Two of the more popular ones are Value
Line and the William O’Neil charts.
Value Line
Value Line (www.valueline.com) is one of the oldest investment-research
services. The company’s analysts combine price and trading volume infor-
mation on stocks with financial data. The numbers are crunched through a
proprietary model to generate two rankings: a stock’s timeliness and its safety.
The higher the stock is on the timeliness ranking, the better it is to buy or hold
it now. Historically, Value Line’s most timely stocks have outperformed the

Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500, so people are willing to pay for
access to the company’s data. In addition, many libraries subscribe to Value
Line’s print service or online database, so you may be able to get access that
way. (Hey, one of the advantages of being an investor is that you have the time
to go to the library to look something up, a marvel to a day trader who’s too
busy to go and get even a cup of coffee.)
Value Line as a company has had some problems, most notably with fraud
related to its mutual-fund business, but the charting system was not part of
those charges.
William O’Neil
William O’Neil (www.williamoneil.com) started a company to distribute his
technical-analysis system on stocks and the stock market, started a newspaper
called Investor’s Business Daily, and wrote a book called How to Make Money in
Stocks (see the appendix for more information about it). The company’s data
services are available only to large institutional investors, such as mutual-fund
and insurance companies, but between the book and the newspaper, individual
investors can learn a lot about identifying momentum to pick good times to
buy or sell a stock.
Many traders — in all securities, not just stocks — find Investor’s Business
Daily to be at least as useful as The Wall Street Journal, because it looks at the
markets from a short-term trading perspective more than from a long-term,
business-management angle.
The company’s ranking system is based on what it calls CAN SLIM, which is
a mnemonic for a list of criteria that a good stock should meet. Note that this
system combines both fundamental and technical indicators:
✓ Current quarterly earnings should be up 25 percent from a year ago.
✓ Annual earnings should be up 25 percent from a year ago.
✓ New products or services should be driving earnings growth, not acqui-
sitions or changes in accounting.
✓ Supply and demand, meaning the number of shares being purchased
each day, is going up.
✓ Leader or laggard? The stock is a leading company in a leading industry
and therefore in the best position to do well.
✓ Institutional sponsorship is in place, meaning that the stock is becoming
more popular with mutual funds, pension funds, and other large
shareowners.
✓ Market indexes, such as the Dow, the NASDAQ, and the S&P 500, should
all be up.

==================================================

Chapter 17: Day Trading for Investors
Of course, not too many stocks out there meet all the CAN SLIM criteria, but
the indicators can give an investor a way of thinking about better times to
buy (when more criteria are met) or sell (when fewer are being met).
The most serious momentum investors tend to be swing traders, who hold
positions for a few weeks or months. Longer-term investors often rely on some
momentum signals, though, such as those on the CAN SLIM list, to help them
identify good times to buy a stock that has been languishing.
When an Investor Considers Trading
Many day traders are also long-term investors. Sure, they trade for the short
term, but they regularly take some of their profits and put them toward
investments that have a longer time frame. It’s smart risk management for a
business that has a high wash-out rate. After all, even a short-term trader has
long-term goals.
But does it ever make sense for a long-term investor to take up short-term
trading? It may, for three reasons: The idea proves itself to be short-term,
the research shows short-term trading patterns that may be profitable, and
fundamental analysis supports short selling (which usually has a shorter
time horizon than a buy would to an investor). The following sections explain
these reasons in more detail.
Don’t try riskier trading strategies unless your portfolio can handle the risk.
As with full-time day trading, engage in part-time and occasional trading strat-
egies only with risk capital, money that you can afford to lose. Money needed
to pay the mortgage this month or pay for retirement in 30 years is not risk
capital.
The idea has a short shelf life
Certain circumstances turn every long-term investor into a trader once or
twice: He buys a security intending to hold it forever, and within a few days
or weeks, some really bad news comes out. Or he buys only to see two days
later that the company is being sold. That great long-term buy-and-hold idea
no longer fits the original parameters, so it’s time to sell. Despite the goal of
holding forever, the investor decides to get out and move on, even if it’s only
a day later.

Your research shows you some
trading opportunities
Good investors monitor their holdings, and some become intimate with the
nuances of a security’s short-term price movements even though the objec-
tive is to hold the position for the long term. An investor who gets a feel for
the trading patterns of a specific holding may want to turn that into swing-
trading and day-trading opportunities. Yes, doing so adds risk to the portfolio
(and the risks of day trading are covered extensively throughout this book),
but it can also increase return.
For example, suppose that an investor who is fascinated with technology
stocks notices that the stocks always rise in price right before big industry
conferences and then fall when the conference is over. She may not want to
change any of her portfolio holdings based on this observation, but she may
want a way to profit. So she buys call options on big technology companies
before the conference and then sells them on the meeting’s first day. That
short-term trade allows her to capture benefits of the price run-up without
affecting her portfolio position.
You see some great short opportunities
Short selling allows a trader to profit from a decline in the price of a security.
The trader enters the order, which automatically arranges the loan of a secu-
rity from the broker followed by a sale in the market. The trader then waits in
hopes that the price will go down. When it does, the trader buys the security
back at the lower price and repays the loan, keeping the difference between
the purchase price and the sale price.
Because the broker charges interest on the loaned securities, short selling
can get expensive. Traders who sell short are usually looking for a relatively
short-term profit, not necessarily over a single day but over months rather
than years.
In addition to the interest, short selling faces another risk, which is that the
security can go up in price while the trader is waiting for it to go down. To
reduce that risk, most short sellers do careful research to make sure that
they’re right about the security being all wrong. And who else does careful
research? Many long-term investors.
For the investor who loves to do research and has some appetite for risk,
short selling is a way to make money from securities that would make ter-
rible long-term holdings because it seems obvious that they aren’t going to
do well. When these investors come across securities that are headed for
trouble, they can short them in the hope of making a nice short-term profit.

D
ay trading is a great career option for the right person in the right
circumstances. It requires a strong, decisive personality who wants to
be running the show every step of the way. And because those profits aren’t
steady, good day traders have some financial cushion and good personal
support systems to get them through the tough times. In this chapter, I list
ten really good reasons to take up day trading. (For balance, I cover ten bad
reasons in Chapter 19.) Think you have what it takes? See how many of these
characteristics fit your life right now.
You Love Being Independent
Day trading is like owning any small business. You’re the boss and you call
the shots. Each day’s successes — and failures — are due to you and you
alone. The market is irrelevant because you can’t control it. Working by
yourself all day, you’re responsible for everything from the temperature in
the office to the functioning of the computers to the accounting for trades.
Good day traders are independent. They don’t want someone to tell them
what to do; they want to figure it out for themselves. They love a challenge,
whether it’s finding a good bargain on office supplies or developing a
profitable way to arbitrage currency prices.
If you would like to work for yourself and control your own destiny, keep
reading. Day trading may be for you.

You Want to Work Anywhere You Like
As a day trader, you have the luxury of setting up shop wherever you please.
All you need is an account with an online brokerage firm and high-speed
Internet access. You don’t even need a computer if you have a smart phone.
Nowadays you can find these tools almost anywhere: at home, at the library,
in a bar, in a big city, in a small town, in the mountains, or in another country.
Day trading offers a lot of geographic flexibility, which few other businesses
do. You can trade while traveling as easily as you would trade at home —
especially as mobile service improves.
You’re Comfortable with Technology
The financial-services industry was one of the first to embrace computer
technology in a big way, back in the 1960s, and it is still a technology-
intensive industry. The people in colored cotton jackets running around
the exchange floor, waving their hands and yelling at each other, are
anachronisms.
Day traders use software to develop and refine their trading strategies.
They trade online using programs to monitor and automate their trades.
They track their trades in spreadsheets and other software. They spend
their days in front of a screen, communicating online with other traders all
over the world. They interact with computers, not human beings, during
the trading day.
Day traders are also self-employed, and many work from home. That means
that if their software crashes, they have to fix it. They have to handle the
upgrades, install the firewalls, and back up the data. Sure, you can pay
someone to do these tasks, but the tech consultant probably won’t be able
to drop everything to get you up and trading again immediately. Hence, good
day traders are comfortable with technology. If you like to mess around with
programs, don’t mind maintaining your computer, and understand how to set
up your hardware for maximum efficiency, you’re in good shape for day
trading. (Chapter 12 has some more on this, too.)
You Want to Eat What You Kill
You don’t have to be a self-employed day trader to trade securities.

for them. In fact, most securities trading takes place through such larger
organizations. But maybe you don’t want to share your profits with someone
else. Maybe you don’t want someone dictating your strategy, placing limits
on your trades, or determining your bonus based as much on factors such as
teamwork and firm profitability as on what you brought in. You want to “eat
what you kill,” as they say, and day trading is one way you can do that.
When you day trade, you’re responsible for your profits and your losses.
That means that you reap the rewards and you don’t have to share them
with anyone else. It’s a powerful incentive for independent people.
You Love the Markets
Good day traders have always been fascinated with the markets and how
they move. If you watch CNBC for fun and have been following the securities
business for years, no matter what your day jobs have been, then you may
be a good candidate for day trading. Of course, I hope you’ve picked up more
than “some people make a lot of money doing this!” A lengthy immersion
in the cycles and systems that drive securities prices can help you develop
trading strategies and know what you are up against.
And the markets are amazing, aren’t they? All the buyers and sellers with
all their different needs come together and find the price that gets the deal
done. The prices assimilate all kinds of information about the state of the
world, the desires of the people trading, and the future expectations for the
economy. It’s capitalism in its purest form, and watching how it works is
almost magical. If you love how the markets work and want to learn first-hand
what they tell you about making money, then by all means keep reading.
You Have Market Experience
If you have never opened an account with a brokerage firm, purchased a
stock, or invested in a mutual fund, you may not be suited for day trading. It’s
not that those activities alone are adequate preparation for day trading, but
they’re a start. They can help you understand all that can happen to cause
you to make or lose money.
If you haven’t made any trades before, don’t quit your day job to day trade.
Instead, flip back to Chapter 17 for some ideas on how you can use short-term
trading in an investment portfolio. That way, you can learn more and build up
your savings before taking the plunge.

You’ve Studied Trading Systems and
Know What Works for You
Much of the work of day trading takes place long before entering the buy or
sell order. You have to define your trading system, see how it would have
worked in the past, and test it to see how it works now. The preparatory work
isn’t as exciting as actually doing the day trading, because you aren’t making
real money, but you’re not losing money, either.
Short-term trading has a huge potential for loss, and many traders are
chasing the exact same ideas. The more you know about how your strategy
works in different market conditions, the better prepared you will be to act
appropriately and profitably.
It can take a long time to find a strategy that works enough of the time to
make it worth your while. Many day traders spend months developing,
testing, and refining their day-trading strategy. You can read more about
the process of strategy testing in Chapter 16.
Because backtesting (which lets you test your trading strategy) uses historic
prices, you can do much of the work on the side, at night, and on weekends,
before you start day trading full time. It’s a good way to get prepared for your
trading business while you save your money and make other preparations for
your new day-trading venture.
You Are Decisive and Persistent
Short-term traders don’t have the luxury of thinking too much about what
they’re doing. Trading has to become intuitive. They have to be able to act
on what they see when they see it. There’s no room for second guessing, for
hesitation, for choking, or for panic attacks.
Good day traders are also persistent. After they find a strategy they trust,
they stick with it no matter how things are going. That’s how they’re able
to buy low and sell high.
Even great traders go through bad periods, but if they trust their system and
continue to stick with it, they usually pull out of the bad period, often with
money ahead. If you’ve been able to stick it out when things went wrong other
times in your life, you know what to expect when day trading.

Chapter 18: Ten Good Reasons to Day Trade
You Can Afford to Lose Money
Obviously, you want to make money. That’s the whole idea of day trading. But
day trading is difficult. Most traders quit in the first year. Some can’t take the
stress, some lose all their money, and some simply don’t make enough money
to make it worth their time.
Like any small business, you’re taking a risk when you set up shop as a day
trader. That risk is easier if you can afford to lose money. I’m not saying you
need to have so much money that you won’t miss it when it’s gone, but you
shouldn’t be day trading with money you need to live on, any more than you
would open a store or start a law practice with money you need to buy
groceries and pay the mortgage.
If your household does not have a second source of income, be sure to set
aside enough money to cover your living expenses while you get started. And
you should keep a second pot of money, your walk-away fund (see Chapter
14), so that you’re free to quit day trading and move on to your next
adventure if you decide it’s not for you.
It’s especially important to have a financial cushion when you’re day trading
for the following reasons:
✓ You can afford to commit to your trading: Having your living expenses
covered, at least at first, isn’t just about dealing with losses. It’s also
about being able to stick with your trading. If you need cash to pay your
bills, you may be tempted to take money out of the market whenever
you’re doing well. Doing so may keep you from reinvesting your profits.
Plus, by not sticking to your strategy, your trading capital won’t grow as
fast. Think of day trading as a way to build a long-term asset, not a way
to generate a steady stream of current income.
✓ You can stay in the market through the rough times: You know the
old saw that the best way to make money is to buy low and sell high,
right? Well, this means that the best time to buy is usually when securi-
ties prices have been beaten up and you’ve lost a lot of money. If you
can afford some losses, staying in the game will be easier. Plus, you’ll be
able to stick to your strategy so that you can profit big when the market
finally turns.
✓ You can better handle the stress of losses: Not all your trades are going
to work out. Some days, you’re going to lose money. If you have enough
money that you don’t fear loss, you can make better decisions. And
you’re less likely to panic if you know that you’ll still be able to eat, pay

your electric bill, and have a roof to sleep under at night. With sufficient
funds, you’re better able to view the markets clearly and follow a
winning strategy.
Trading is very much a game of psychology. Give yourself an edge by waiting
to do it until you can afford to.
You Have a Support System
Trading is stressful. The markets gyrate from events that no one can foresee.
Things just happen, and no one else who’s trading cares how these events
affect you. It’s enough to make you crazy some days, and unfortunately, some
traders do get crazy. Alcoholism, depression, divorce, and suicide seem to be
occupational hazards for those traders who have trouble separating what’s
happening in the market with who they are as people.
The securities markets are wonderful mechanisms for bringing together
diverse buyers and sellers. They are not wonderful for propping up your ego,
helping you through a rough time in your life, or slipping you a little extra
money when you most need it. The markets are not human. They are ruthless
machines designed to generate the best price for the aggregate of the buyers
and sellers participating that day. Some days, the markets will be in your favor,
and some days, they will go against you.
Good day traders are psychologically strong. They understand how their
weaknesses come out when they are stressed. They have people (good
friends and supportive families) and activities (from exercise routines to
hobbies) that help give their brains a break from trading.
Chapter 14 talks about managing the stress of day trading, and in many ways,
I think it’s the most important chapter in this book.

Ten or So Good Reasons to Avoid
Day Trading
In This Chapter
▶ Considering other ways to invest that suit you better
▶ Taking into account your personality and preferences
▶ Recognizing the hard work that successful day trading requires
▶ Putting a damper on unrealistic expectations
D
ay trading isn’t right for everyone. In fact, it’s a bad idea for most
people. It requires a strong personality, someone who can face the gyra-
tions of the markets day in and day out. And it also requires someone with
enough attention to detail to run a business. It’s a great career option for
the right person in the right circumstances. But for people who have trouble
keeping cool or who don’t have the patience to learn how to trade, and for
anyone who has a gambling problem, day trading can be a quick road to ruin.
In this chapter, I list eleven signs that may indicate day trading isn’t right for
you right now. Take these signs seriously. Most day traders lose money, in
part because a lot of people who aren’t cut out for day trading try it anyway.
You Want to Learn Investing
by Day Trading
Many people want to manage their own investments. Although doing so is
certainly possible, you first need to take the time to learn about the basics of
finance, such as the relationship between risk and return, proper diversifica-
tion, and time horizons that are appropriate to your situation. In fact, there’s a
great book called Investing For Dummies, by Eric Tyson (Wiley), that can help.

Part IV: The Part of Tens
Some people confuse investing with day trading, though, and these two
disciplines are not the same. I list tons of information on the differences in
Chapter 4, but here’s the condensed version: Day trading involves rapid
buying and selling of securities to take advantage of small movements in
prices. This can be a successful strategy for part of your investment account,
but day trading with all your money is not a good idea.
Buying and selling securities on your own without being a day trader
is entirely possible. And if you don’t know another good term for “self-
employed person managing her own money,” just tell people you run your
own hedge fund. You’ll get better tables at restaurants that way.
You Love Fundamental Research
Fundamental research, discussed in Chapter 7, is the process of analyzing a
company to see how good its business is and what the company’s securities
are worth. Fundamental analysts crunch numbers, build forecasts, check out
products, and look for stocks that are going to do well over the long term.
They dream of uncovering the next Google or the next Walmart and holding
the stock all the way up.
Fundamental research is antithetical to day trading. Day traders look for
profit opportunities in short-term price movements. They often do not know
what industry a company is in, nor do they care. If you love the
fundamentals, you’re probably too analytical to be a good day trader.
You’re Short on Time and Capital
Getting started in day trading is a lot like buying a small business. It takes
commitment of both time and of money. If you don’t have enough time, learn-
ing technical patterns is difficult. If you don’t have the money, you won’t be
able to work through rough cycles. And there will be rough cycles. That’s day
trading’s only sure thing.
Some day traders are able to trade part time. If you are disciplined, you can be
successful as a part-time trader. The key is to close out your positions at the
end of your designated trading period as though the market day were ending.
If your plan is to trade for two hours a day, then trade for two hours a day and
no more. Use an alarm clock as your personal trading bell.

Chapter 19: Ten or So Good Reasons to Avoid Day Trading
You Like Working As Part of a Group
A decade ago, most large cities had day trading offices, called trading
arcades, where traders could go each day to buy and sell securities. The big
advantage these firms offered was high-speed Internet access. Now almost
everyone can get high-speed Internet access at home, so there’s little need
for day traders to go elsewhere, and most of these offices are closed.
Working at home is great for some people. If you prefer camaraderie during
the day, like the support of a team, and want friendly faces around you,
you’re likely to be miserable day trading. It’s just you and the market, and the
market doesn’t have a great sense of humor.
You Can’t Be Bothered with the Details
of Running a Business
Day traders are small-business people, and their entrepreneurial flair goes
beyond making their own buy and sell decisions. They also buy equipment,
shop for supplies, and maintain careful income tax records. To some, this is
exhilarating. No more mean office manager who decides how many and what
kind of pens must be used. No more going through hoops and bringing in let-
ters from a doctor to get a fancy ergonomic chair. You’re the boss, and if you
want it, you can have it.
But to others, all this responsibility is overwhelming. Picking out pens?
Creating backup procedures? Worrying about accounting software? It’s too
much. If the mere thought of standing at the office-supply store gives you the
heebie-jeebies, you may want to consider trading as an employee rather than
trading for your own account.
You Crave Excitement
Trading seems so exciting. You’ve seen the stereotypical picture of the people
on the floor at the Chicago Board of Trade, wearing bright-colored jackets
and loud ties, screaming and waving their arms. It gets my blood running to
just think about it. Of course, they were probably shouting out coffee orders
and waving their arms in a debate over the Cubs versus the Sox. And anyway,
floor trading is mostly obsolete. Most of the large stock, bond, and derivative
exchanges have gone through mergers and reduced the square footage of
their trading floors because of changes in how people trade. Nowadays, most

traders sit in offices in front of computer screens. They have to stay focused
on the little blips in front of them, and it can be deathly dull. Some days few,
if any, opportunities come up to trade using your system.
If you crave excitement and have trouble staying focused, you may find that
day trading is too boring for you. It can involve intense stress with few
opportunities to work it off during the day.
You’re Impulsive
With the frenzy of trades and the rapid-fire decisions involved, day trading may
seem like a perfect career for an impulsive person. It’s all about instinct, about
acting on your hunches, about pulling the trigger and seeing what happens.
Right? Uh, no. To be a good day trader, you have to trust your trading system
more than your hunches. Sometimes you’ll make trades when it doesn’t seem
right and you’ll sit out periods even though you are itching to get in. Good day
traders are quick thinkers, but they do think. If you like to act now and deal
with the consequences later, day trading isn’t a good idea for you.
You Love Going to the Casino
Do you get a big rush out of gambling? Do you love trying to beat the odds?
Does day trading seem just like a visit to Vegas without the airfare? Then you
shouldn’t be day trading. Unlike at a casino, no one is going to give you free
drinks or Celine Dion tickets in exchange for your massive losses.
A lot of traders like to gamble. Every trader has some crazy story about play-
ing Liar’s Poker using the serial numbers on dollar bills instead of with cards,
or about a friend of a friend who bet on whether the person walking in front
of him would turn right or left. And that’s fine, if they keep their gambling in
perspective and bet no more than they can afford to lose.
Trading isn’t necessarily gambling, but it can be, especially if you get carried
away with the market and don’t stick to your trading and money-management
systems. But remember this: In gambling, the odds always favor the house.
When you cross the line, you hand your profit potential over to someone else.
The line between day trading and gambling is thin. Check the questions at
www.gamblersanonymous.org/ga/content/20-questions to see
whether you may have a gambling problem. Substitute day trading for gam-
bling and see what you come up with. And by all means, get help if you have a
problem. Don’t take up day trading.

Chapter 19: Ten or So Good Reasons to Avoid Day Trading
You Have Trouble Setting Boundaries
Successful day traders are disciplined. They have set trading hours that they
stick to and set systems they use to plan trades and manage their money.
They took the time to carefully test their trading strategy (see Chapter 16
for more on how you can do that). They understand that if they don’t have
a system and manage their risk, they are more likely to become one of those
numerous day traders who lose everything early on.
The whole idea behind day trading is that you limit risk by closing out your
positions at the end of the day. The financial markets are global, though, so
in theory, the trading day never ends. If you have a hard time turning off the
lights at the end of the day, you may not be the best day trader. If you resent
rules, you may rebel against the rules that you’ve set for yourself.
Good day traders know that they are cut out for day trading before they even
begin. They’ve taken the time to assess how their personality and psychologi-
cal makeup mix with the demands of the job. And one key trait is discipline.
You Want to Get Rich Quick
Day traders look for short-term profit opportunities, so it follows that day
trading leads to big, fast profits, right? Wrong. Day traders make money by
collecting a large number of small profits. Those who make money usually do
it through patience and persistence. Yeah, one or two day traders out there
may have managed to make a killing in a week, but they’re the exception.
Research shows that 80 percent of day traders lose their capital and are gone
from the business within one year. Instead of getting rich, you are more likely
to go broke quick from day trading. If you don’t like those odds, try something
else with your money.
The Guy on the Infomercial Said It
Would Work
A lot of money can be made in day trading, but sometimes it seems like more
money is made selling day-trading training systems. Some of these systems
are heavily marketed, even through television infomercials. The sales pitch
makes day trading seem like an easy, safe, fun way to make money using your

own smarts. These commercials leave out pesky details about researching
and testing systems, high levels of risk, and the pressure trading can place on
a person. And the wash-sale rule (it’s a tax thing; refer to Chapter 15) is never
mentioned.
Day trading is great for some people. But like anything, if it sounds too good
to be true, it probably is. Don’t let a strong-arm sales pitch cost you your
hard-earned money.

Ten Common Day-Trading
Mistakes
In This Chapter
▶ Avoiding other people’s trading mistakes
▶ Steering clear of psychological and preparation mistakes
D
ay trading is tough. Many popular markets are zero-sum games, mean-
ing that for every winner, there’s a loser. Other markets, such as the
stock market, have a positive bias, meaning they have a tendency to increase
in value over time, but you may rarely see big moves in any one day. And the
whole point of day trading is to close your positions each night. Most day
traders lose money, in part because they make obvious, avoidable mistakes.
This list of ten mistakes can help you avoid the most serious ones. Avoiding
these mistakes is no guarantee that you’ll make money trading, but it can
certainly reduce your risk and improve your odds. And that’s half the battle.
Starting with Unrealistic Expectations
Most day traders lose money. Some research shows that 80 percent of day
traders wash out in the first year. Brokerage firms that deal with day traders
are constantly figuring out ways to attract new customers, because it is so
hard to retain the ones they have for the long term.
Yes, some traders make money. A few make a lot of money. But they are the
exception. Making money day trading is tough, making enough money to
cover the value of your time is even tougher. If you go into trading knowing
that it’s hard, that you should only risk money that you can afford to lose, and
that you need to think about it as a business, you’ll have a leg up on those
who think that they’ve found an easy way to make millions from the comfort
of their own home — and who are then stunned to discover they are broke.

Part IV: The Part of Tens
Starting without a Business
and Trading Plan
Trading is a business. When you decide to day trade, you are committing
capital to an entrepreneurial business with a high risk of failure. You are no
different from your brother-in-law who decided to open a sandwich shop
franchise, your neighbor who joined a startup company for little salary and
lots of equity, or your college buddy who has been trying to make a go of it as
a full-commission life insurance salesman. You are all out on your own, risk-
ing your capital in the hope of great success but knowing that many others
doing the same thing fail.
Successful businesses have business plans, and your trading business is no
different. You need to specify what you are going to trade, when you’re going
to trade, how you’re going to trade, and with how much money — before you
get started. You need to determine what equipment you need, what services
and training you want, and how you will measure your success. Chapter 2 can
help you with a business plan, and the rest of the book can help you fill in the
appropriate sections of it. Having the plan will keep your expectations in line
and create a professional starting point for your new trading venture.
You also need to supplement your business plan with a plan for your trad-
ing. How are you going to trade? What signals will you watch for? Under what
conditions will you enter a position, and under what conditions will you
close it? That’s your trading plan. Good traders have trading plans so that
they know exactly what they want to do when they see opportunities in the
market. This plan reduces the fear and doubt that can unsettle most traders,
and it heads off the panic that destroys more than a few. Read Part II of this
book for ideas on how to trade.
In addition, good trading plans have to be tested and evaluated. Chapter 16
has good information on testing and evaluation so that you have enough confi-
dence in your system to follow it, even when the market gets squirrelly on you.
Failing to plan is planning to fail, as the cliché goes. You are risking too much of
your hard-earned money to skip careful upfront planning. Take responsibility
for your trading.
Ignoring Cash Management
Because financial markets can be volatile, you can easily get wiped out.
Good cash management can help you stay in the game. Because you never
commit all of your capital to any one trade, no one trade can shut you down.

Chapter 20: Ten Common Day-Trading Mistakes
At times — like when you know you’ve got a great idea — holding back some
cash may not seem right, but if you plan to trade for the long run, you need
to follow your money-management strategy. Otherwise, you’ll never be able
to get a winning trade that can offset your losses.
You need to have your wits about you to day trade, but you also need to have
capital. Chapter 6 has some great information on cash management, so don’t
skip it!
Failing to Manage Risk
Day trading is risky business, and most day traders quit because of losses.
(Have I told you that already?) Even traders who stick with it have many losing
trades. That’s why they have risk-management systems in place. Their trading
plans include stops, which automatically execute buy or sell orders when secu-
rities reach predetermined levels. (Stops are discussed in Chapter 2.)
The day trader looking for trouble places orders without thinking about how
much of a security to buy or sell at any one time, and she thinks that she’ll
just know when to sell. And then she second-guesses herself and finds herself
with bigger losses than she intended.
If you’re going to day trade, be safe. You know what the risks are (that’s why
you picked up this book), so use the protection offered by stops and sound
money management.
Most day traders lose money. Don’t risk money you can’t afford to lose, and
plan for the risks that you take.
Not Committing the Time and Money
to Do It Right
Day trading is a job. It’s a small-business endeavor that requires research and
training well in advance of the first trade. It’s not something you can squeeze
into an hour a day as a hobby. To do well, you need to set regular hours and
have enough money to generate reasonable returns without unreasonable risks.
Many people think day trading is something that they can easily enter into
and that they can generate profits while their kids are napping. That thinking
is a mistake. If you can’t dedicate the time necessary to study the markets
and understand how you react to them, you will have trouble staying in the
trading business.

==================================================

312
Part IV: The Part of Tens
Day trading is a business of frequent trades with small percentage gains and a
high potential for loss. If you have days of losses, a small account will quickly
end up with too little money to meet minimum order sizes. Therefore, suc-
cessful traders start with enough money to last through periods of drawdown
and are still able to generate meaningful dollar returns. Consider this:
A 1 percent return on $1,000 is equal to $10, but a 1 percent return on
$100,000 is $1,000.
If you have more money to begin with, the dollars you make from day trading
will seem more real to you. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and
the National Association of Securities Dealers define day traders in part as
customers with $25,000 in their accounts. If you have $25,000 you can afford
to lose, you are more likely to be a successful day trader than if you have only
$2,500 — and you’ll be considered to be a day trader, not a dilettante.
You are going to lose money. All day traders have bad days, and they are more
likely to lose money early in their trading careers before they get a feel for the
markets and their own reactions to it. If you have enough money when you
begin, you can consider these losses to be part of your apprenticeship.
Chasing the Herd
Everyone in the market is looking at the same data and the same techni-
cal indicators (like those discussed in Chapter 7). Good day traders follow
market trends but with the goal of being early or on time. Those who get in
late get crushed: They buy too high, or they sell too low. Chasing the herd is
tempting, because it’s so hard to watch the market move away from you.
Day trading requires quick reactions. It’s video games and psychology, some
people joke, because the trader who can figure out what others in the market
are doing and then click on the mouse button fastest has a huge advantage.
The trader who hesitates or goes along for the ride is likely to be ruined.
There’s no easy solution for this. It helps if you know that you are psychologi-
cally cut out for day trading (covered in Chapter 14) and have confidence in
the long-term performance of your trading system (covered in Chapter 16).
But to a big extent, you just have to have some experience in the markets to
know how your trading system matches what’s in your head.
Switching between Research Systems
Day traders lose money, at least part of the time. And losing money can cause
a day trader to lose trust in his trading system. And many do what seems
logical, which is move to a trading system that seems to be working. The

==================================================

313
Chapter 20: Ten Common Day-Trading Mistakes
problem is that no system works all the time; if one did, everyone would use
it. And sometimes things look worst before they turn. By switching systems
whenever things look bad, the trader never learns the nuances of how a given
system works for him. And he’s likely to get stuck on another downtrend,
picking up the new system right when the old one starts to work again.
Markets go in cycles. No system works all the time, but if you panic and start
trying new things without doing a lot of upfront work, you’re likely to make
things worse. Chapter 16 covers performance evaluation and system testing
in great detail. The more you understand your system and how it works, the
less likely you are to be brought down by floundering around for new
systems all the time.
Bottom line: Anyone who has a magic trading system that works in all
markets is retired and living on a beach in Maui. Everyone else has to live
through a few rough stretches.
Overtrading
Because day traders don’t hold positions for long periods of time, they rarely
enjoy big and profitable price moves. Instead, they make money from lots of
transactions with small profits. They are crazy people, moving in and out for
short periods. But believe it or not, the day trader who trades too much loses
out. She won’t be in the market for large intra-day moves, and she’ll get killed
on commissions and other transactions costs.
As paradoxical as it seems, many day traders do better by making fewer
trades each day. That way, commissions and fees take a smaller bite of the
profit. One way to profit from fewer trades is with better money management,
discussed in Chapter 6. A trader who puts money to work appropriately can
often make more money than one who trades frenetically.
Sticking Too Long with Losing Trades
Day traders are often overcome with fear, doubt, greed, and hope. They are
afraid to recognize a loss. They wonder whether they’re good traders. They
don’t want to pay the commission to get out of the loser. And if the security
was a good buy at the higher price, it’s surely a better buy now that the price
has gone down. These traders think that if they just keep a positive mental
attitude, everything will work out all right in the end.
Good traders have systems in place to limit their losses. They use stop
orders (Chapter 2) to force themselves out of bad trades. They would rather
put the money to work on a good trade than stick out a bad one.

The market doesn’t know your position; even if it did, it wouldn’t care.
Therefore, no amount of wishing and hoping will cause the market to reward
you for your patience. If a trade isn’t working, get out. As the man in the
musical sings, tomorrow is a latter day.
Getting Too Emotionally Involved
Trading is a stressful business. You’re up against an impersonal market that
moves seemingly at random (and many academics would say that it moves
truly at random). It involves money, which to some people is a way to keep
score in life and to others is their primary source of security. Losing trades
mean a loss of status and a loss of safety. It’s no wonder that so many traders
are head cases when the entire market sometimes seems to be conspiring
against you — you specifically.
The best traders are almost Zen-like in their lack of attachment to the market.
They are able to remove themselves from the frenzy of the trading day so
that they’re not susceptible to fear, doubt, greed, and hope. Chapter 14 has
some advice that can help you approach the trading day in a calmer manner.
Only you know whether you are capable of that.

you will cut your losses, and when you will walk away with money in your
pocket. If you don’t manage your money, you won’t be trading long.
Here, you get an overview of the key money-management techniques that
you should consider as well as one that is a very bad idea. Some of these
techniques are simple; no calculation is required, and you can use them right
away. Others involve a little workout with your calculator. A few of these
techniques need your performance history to work, so you can’t use them
right away, but you can experiment with them as you build your trade data.
(And yes, this is one of the many reasons that traders should keep records of
trading activity; see Chapter 16.)
These days, many brokers include money-management calculators and apps in
their trading systems, so you can enter the parameters that reflect your trad-
ing style and your account balance to get the right amount to trade, right away.
These calculators remove the guesswork and mystery associated with some of
these techniques — if you use them. Chapter 11 has more information.

Part IV: The Part of Tens
Taking Money off the Table
Here’s the simplest form of money management: When you’re up, take the
profit rather than waiting to make even more money. Fight the greed, take the
cash, and call it a day.
If you have a week, month, or year with particularly strong profits, take a
little money out of your trading account and put it in a retirement fund, use it
to pay off a debt, or move it into a low-risk investment to help diversify your
high-risk trading activities.
Even if you do nothing else, taking profits when you have them can help keep
you in the game longer.
Using Stops
Unless you’re a machine, staying disciplined all the time can be difficult.
Humans do goofy things. That’s why there’s a simple way to force discipline
on your trading to keep your losses from destroying your trading account: a
stop order.
A stop order, also called a stop-loss order, is an order to buy or sell a security
as soon as it hits a given price, known as a stop price. The order sits dormant in
the broker’s computer until the market price hits the stop, and then the order
is executed. This automated action helps you lock in a profit or cut a loss. Some
traders don’t like stops because on occasion one will be executed on a one-time
down trade or while a stock is shooting up at price, causing them to leave some
money on the table. However, stops are an easy way to force discipline into
trading. They can help you manage your money with very little extra effort.
Yes, some brokers charge an extra commission for a stop order. But it may be
worth it.
Applying Gann’s 10 Percent Rule
The Gann money-management system is part of a complicated system of
technical analysis used to identify good securities trades. The chart system
is complex, but the money-management system is simple. The core of it is
a limit on the money placed on any one trade to 10 percent of the account



==================================================
                     PAGE 333                     
==================================================

317
Chapter 21: Ten Tested Money-Management Techniques
value, never more. The dollar value of that 10 percent goes up or down as the
account value changes, but the 10 percent limit ensures that you always have
some powder dry to stay in the market.
Most traders who follow Gann’s 10 percent rule combine it with stops to limit
losses.
You can’t take advantage of a profitable opportunity if you have no money to
trade. You can lose everything in your account if you let your losses run.
Limiting Your Losses with the Fixed
Fractional System
The fixed fractional system is misnamed; it’s actually a range of fractions that
determine how much of your trade capital to risk on any one trade. A larger
fraction is allocated to less risky trades; a smaller fraction to more risky ones.
The calculation can be found in Chapter 6.
To do the calculation, you need to know how much money you can lose on
any one trade. The study needed to determine that amount can go a long way
toward improving your trading without getting into the math. Fixed fractional
takes the stop a step further; it helps you limit your losses and pick up more
from your wins by considering how much to trade along with the potential
value of losses and gains.
Increasing Returns with the
Fixed-Ratio System
The fixed-ratio system of money management is related to fixed fractional
trade sizing. The key difference is that it looks at accumulated profit rather
than total account size. (Accumulated profit is the value of the account less
the capital that you put into it when you started trading.)
This system was specifically designed for options and futures trading by
Ryan Jones, a trader himself. The goal is to increase returns from winning
trades and protect profits from losing ones. The basic calculation is in
Chapter 6.

Part IV: The Part of Tens
Following the Kelly Criterion Formula
The Kelly Criterion is based on some statistical work by mathematicians
working at Bell Labs in the 1950s. They realized that it had applications to
gambling, so they went to Las Vegas and made a lot of money at blackjack.
I kid you not. The casinos changed the rules so that it no longer works at
Vegas, but it does work in securities markets.
What this formula does is ensure that you will never run out of money, so you
will always be able to place yet one more trade. In the real world, of course,
you can reach a point where you still have money but don’t have enough to
place a trade.
1−W
Kelly%=W −
( )
R
The equation looks at the percentage of trades that are expected to make
money (W), the return from a winning trade, and the ratio of the average gain
from a winning trade relative to the average loss of a losing trade (R). You
may not be able to use the Kelly criterion until you have been trading long
enough to amass data to use in the equation, but that’s okay — you have
other choices here!
The Kelly criterion often generates a trade size larger than many traders are
willing to use. One alternative is a half Kelly trade, using half of the amount
recommended by the equation.
Figuring the Amount to Trade
with Optimal F
Optimal F is another money-management system that needs performance
figures to generate an ideal trade size. It was developed by Ralph Vince, a
trader, and it comes up with the ideal fraction of your account to trade based
on your past performance. The calculation changes with every trade, so it’s
usually done through a spreadsheet or an app.

Chapter 21: Ten Tested Money-Management Techniques
Measuring Risk and Sizing Trades with
Monte Carlo Simulation
The Monte Carlo simulation is another money-management system drawn
from gambling. It’s used for risk management in many different businesses,
including trading. You enter risk and return parameters into a computer pro-
gram, and it tells you the likelihood of total loss and the optimal trade size.
The system can’t account for every possible thing that can go wrong, and it
requires a lot of computer power — even nowadays. That being said, many
trading and brokerage platforms have Monte Carlo applications that can be
used to help you measure risk and size trades.
Taking a Risk with the
Martingale System
Martingale is another simple money-management system, no calculator
required. It’s popular with gamblers and traders alike. You start with a small
amount per trade — you get to pick it yourself, but it should probably be
less than 5 percent of your account value. If the trade works, your next trade
should be the same amount. If the trade does not work, then you close it out
and place double the amount (double down, as they say) on the next trade so
that you win back the loss. That doesn’t work? Double again. After you have a
winning trade, go back to the initial amount for your next trade.
If you have to double down for a long series of trades, the money involved
quickly grows: from $2,000, for example, to $4,000, $8,000, $16,000, $32,000,
$64,000, and even $128,000 if you have six losing trades in a row. This is the
problem. If you have an infinite amount of money, you will come out ahead
using martingale. Of course, if you had an infinite amount of money, you
probably wouldn’t be reading this book.
With martingale, you can run out of money before you have a trade that
works. The method works best for aggressive traders with large accounts
who start with small initial trades. It’s a risky money-management strategy,
but it’s also far preferable to having no strategy at all.

Part IV: The Part of Tens
Throwing It to the Fates
Many traders have a logical problem with money management. If you have a
sure thing, why shouldn’t you put all your money on it? If you know the next
trade is going to be great, why should you close out the day with a balance
decline? Ah, but your logic is colored green with greed.
Few sure things are as sure as they seem. Lose on the sure thing, and you
won’t be around for the next trade. Exceed your daily loss limit, and you’ll
have even greater losses.
The wise sage Bart Simpson once said that years of watching television
taught him that miracles always happen to poor children on Christmas Eve.
Knowledge of money management is more of a sure thing than believing that
you will be the beneficiary of a miracle today.

Great Books for Great Trading
Have a shelf that looks a little bare? Fill it up with a few of these beauties.
Basic trading guides
The following books offer nuts-and-bolts information on day trading:
✓ Algorithmic Trading and DMA: An Introduction to Direct Access
Trading Strategies, by Barry Johnson (4Myeloma Press): This is the
textbook on algorithmic and program trading. If you want to trade this
way, you’ll need the book; if you want to learn more about what other
traders are doing, you’ll probably want it. The downside is that this
volume is as much doorstop as book.
✓ The Bible of Options Strategies: The Definitive Guide for Practical
Trading Strategies, by Gary Cohen (FT Press): Many traders prefer
options to stocks, and this book covers the main strategies as well as
some of the more esoteric ones that may work for you.
✓ Day Trading the Currency Market: Technical and Fundamental
Strategies to Profit from Market Swings, by Kathy Lien (Wiley): The
foreign exchange (forex) market is popular with day traders, but it’s a

little different from the stock and futures markets. Trading in currency
relies heavily on leverage, and market participants have more motiva-
tions than simply hedging or speculating. If you are interested in trading
currencies, this book can help you get started.
✓ Mastering the Trade, 2nd Edition, by John F. Carter (McGraw-Hill):
The author, an experienced trader, walks day traders and swing traders
through the ins and outs of the markets, offering specific advice on dif-
ferent trading opportunities. He includes charts and data that explain
when to place a trade and when to close it out. This book is practical,
useful, and detailed.
✓ The New Money Management: A Framework for Asset Allocation, by
Ralph Vince (Wiley): Money management can keep traders in the game
longer while maximizing potential returns. It’s a key discipline that can
mean the difference between long-run success and failure. Unfortunately,
many day traders completely overlook money management. This book
reviews Vince’s money-management system in great detail.
✓ Trading Rules that Work: The 28 Lessons Every Trader Must
Master, by Jason Jankovsky (Wiley): If it were possible to get rich
from knowing just a handful of specific trading indicators, every
trader would retire and run huge charitable foundations. But it’s not
that easy. Instead, a disciplined, professional approach to the market
makes a difference over the long run. This book is a useful overview
of different trading rules, why they work, and how traders should
apply them.
✓ Trading Systems and Methods, 5th Edition, by Perry J. Kaufman
(Wiley): This textbook on trading systems provides a detailed analysis
of the popular and the obscure alike. What makes it especially nice is
the book has a companion website with actual trading programs on it.
You can use them as a starting point for developing your own trading
systems.
Technical analysis guides
Technical analysis is a system of looking at price and volume trends to deter-
mine supply and demand levels in the market. Supply and demand, of course,
drive price changes, so understanding the dynamics is pretty darn useful.
Here are a few books that cover technical analysis in detail:
✓ Candlestick Charting For Dummies, by Russell Rhoads (Wiley):
Candlestick charts were developed in Japan and are the basis of a
system of technical analysis that’s popular with short-term traders,
including day traders. This book explains how to identify and use
candlestick patterns.

Appendix: Additional Resources for Day Traders
✓ Mind Over Markets: Power Trading with Market Generated
Information, by James Dalton, Eric Jones, and Robert Bevan Dalton
(Traders Press): Don’t let the title fool you. This book is not about trad-
ing psychology. Instead, it covers a price-charting and technical-analysis
system in great depth, especially the relationships between price
changes and volume changes. The system, called market profile, is
especially useful for day traders working in futures markets.
✓ Tape Reading and Market Tactics, by Humphrey B. Neill
(Marketplace Books): In the early part of the 20th century, traders
looked at price and volume information that came across ticker tapes.
Traders still rely on an analysis of price and volume information, just
with different tools. This book was originally written in 1931, but many
day traders find that Neill’s advice on what to look for and what to avoid
when looking at price data still holds true.
✓ Technical Analysis For Dummies, by Barbara Rockefeller (Wiley): Day
traders use technical analysis to help gauge market activity, and this book is
a detailed guide on reading charts and applying the information to trading
in an intelligent way. What else would a For Dummies book offer?
Schools of price theory
Most day traders take an eclectic approach to the markets. They find a few
indicators that help them and then apply those indicators to the situation in
the market. Over time, they refine their systems. Some traders, however, rely
on specific theories for how prices should move. Here are some basic texts
on the different theories.
✓ Dow Theory Unplugged, by Charles Dow, Richard Russell, et al.
(W&A Publishing): The Dow Theory, developed by Charles Dow, pub-
lisher of The Wall Street Journal, predicts overall market performance
based on the performance of different industry sectors. It doesn’t work
quite the same way it once did, given how much less industrial the U.S.
economy is than in Dow’s time. This book includes Dow’s essays as well
as commentary and analysis from different experts.
✓ Elliott Wave Principle: Key to Market Behavior, by A.J. Frost and
Robert R. Prechter, Jr. (Wiley): The Elliott Wave theory is a strange
animal. It looks for really long-term patterns in the markets — over
decades and even centuries — based on the Fibonacci series, a number
series found in nature. It’s not widely used, but some traders swear by it.
✓ How to Make Profits in Commodities, by W.D. Gann (Lambert Gann):
This book isn’t exactly an easy read, but many analysts believe that
Gann’s system can help them figure out how prices change over time.
The original text dates from the 1940s. Some people find it dated; others
think it’s timeless.

Day Trading For Dummies, 3rd Edition
✓ How to Make Money in Stocks: A Winning System in Good Times or
Bad, by William J. O’Neill (McGraw-Hill): William O’Neill’s system is of
most interest to people who are swing trading or investing in common
stock, but it may help day traders understand what other participants
in the market are looking at when they place orders. The book explains
momentum investing, which looks for stocks of companies with
improving business trends and performance.
Trading psychology
Good traders are mentally tough. They need the confidence to face the
market, the decisiveness to place orders, and the fortitude to take losses —
and do it against a faceless mix of everyone else trading that day. Several
books address trading psychology specifically; others on mental strength are
also popular with traders because their lessons can be applied to the markets:
✓ The Art of War, by Sun Tzu: It seems like every trader I’ve ever met has
a copy of The Art of War. It’s a Chinese text describing military strategy,
including the importance of mental toughness and strict discipline. First
translated into a European language in 1782, several different versions
and translations are in print.
✓ Awaken the Giant Within, by Anthony Robbins (Pocket Books): This
basic self-help book is popular with all sorts of folks. Many traders find
that Robbins’s methods give them confidence and help them control
their minds when they’re trading.
✓ The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind, by Gustave LeBon (Dover
Books): In the 19th century, Gustave LeBon wrote this treatise on crowd
psychology. He didn’t think much of his fellow human beings, but many
traders have found that his insights explain some short-term irrational
behavior in the markets. Understanding why traders make mistakes can
help you make profits.
✓ The Disciplined Trader: Developing Winning Attitudes, by Mark
Douglas (Prentice Hall): Mark Douglas is a trader who lost a lot of
money and tried to figure out why. As he did that, he developed a great
deal of insight into the psychological aspects of trading. Namely, the
market doesn’t care about who is trading in it, so every trader is respon-
sible for his or her own results. Many experienced day traders swear by
the information in this book.
✓ Trading in the Zone, by Mark Douglas (Prentice Hall): This book
covers the mental discipline of trading, emphasizing the practices and
routines that take the emotion out of it. A trader has a short time to
make a profit, and some panic at the idea. This book has helped many
traders focus on the key elements of trading rather than the fear, doubt,
and greed that can undo the best of them.

Appendix: Additional Resources for Day Traders
History and memoir
I’m not willing to accept the Elliott Wave and say that all market movements
are part of overarching trends, but market history — like all history — tends
to repeat. Why? Because people are people, and no matter how commerce
and the economy changes, people do the same things over and over again:
✓ Double Down: Reflections on Gambling and Loss, by Frederick
and Stephen Barthelme (Harvest Books): Want to see what a gam-
bling addiction looks like? The Barthelme brothers are writers and
English professors who inherited $250,000 from their father’s estate
and then lost it all playing casino blackjack. It’s a story of how compli-
cated relationships with money cause people to make bad decisions.
For a day trader, this book tells what happens when people cannot
place limits for emotional reasons, a route to ruin in the casino or
during the trading day.
✓ Fortune’s Formula: The Untold Story of the Scientific Betting System
that Beat the Casinos and Wall Street, by William Poundstone (Hill
and Wang): Claude Shannon and John Kelly were Bell Labs scientists
working on queuing theories for long-distance calls when they stumbled
on what is known as the Kelly Criterion: The ideal proportion of money
to bet can be found by the ratio of your edge in the market divided by
the odds of winning. Day traders can use this edge/odds formula to figure
out how much money to allocate to a trade. This book explains how the
system works, though it never quite proves that it works when applied
to legitimate casinos or to trading.
✓ Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, by Edwin LeFevre (Wiley): This
classic, written before the 1929 market crash, tells of the adventures of
Jesse Livermore, one of the most successful traders of his time. It’s a dis-
guised memoir of speculation, with a character named Larry Livingston
standing in for Livermore. Some traders like it for the lessons they can
learn from Livermore; others are just amused by how unchanged the art
of day trading is despite dramatic changes in technology.
The Trader’s Internet
Day trading was made possible by the Internet. When high-speed connec-
tivity to market data became affordable, almost anyone could trade with
the same speed as folks working on the exchange floor or a brokerage
trading desk. And yet the Internet can be a terrible distraction to a day
trader or to anyone else working alone. Here are some good websites for
day traders, but you may want to limit your use of them to before and after
trading hours.

Other Mainstream Media
Even though traders are hooked to real-time market data through the
Internet, they still look to some old-style sources for information. Believe it
or not!
✓ Barron’s: Barron’s (www.barrons.com) is a weekly financial newspaper
published by Dow Jones & Company. The primary emphasis is on
long-term investing, but it carries in-depth market analysis and often
interviews outstanding traders. In addition, the regular “Electronic
Trader” column carries news and ratings of online brokerage firms, many
of which specialize in services for day traders.

Author’s Acknowledgments
So many wonderful people helped me on the different editions of this book.
I talked to many day traders, brokers, and others in the investment busi-
ness, including Jack Alogna and Beth Cotner; Michael Browne of DTN Inc.;
Nihar Dalil, Glenda Dowie, Greg Gocek, and Robert Cohen of the CFA Society
of Chicago; Mary Haffenberg and Curt Zuckert at the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange; John T. Hoagland, Conor Meegan, and Michael Patak at Topstep
Trader; Anil Joshi of NuFact; Karen H. at Gamblers Anonymous; James Kupfer
of Waterston Financial; James Lee of TradersLaboratory.com; Wayne Lee
of NASDAQ; Michael Lindsay, Khurram Naik, and James Cagnina at Infinity
Brokerage Services; Casey Nicholson, Erika Olson, Don Padou, Karina Rubel,
Mario Sant Singh, Chris Tabaka, Elizabeth Tabaka, and Allen Ward. I also
talked to several other traders who asked to remain anonymous; they know
who they are, and I hope they also know how much I appreciate their help.
As for the mechanics of putting together the book, Alissa Schwipps and Stacy
Kennedy of Wiley were great to work with this time around. Finally, my agent,
Marilyn Allen, made it all happen.
Thanks, everyone!
