To Paul A. Samuelson, professor of economics
at Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Nobel Laureate, investment sage.
In 1948 when I was a student at Princeton
University, his classic textbook introduced me
to economics. In 1974, his writings reignited my
interest in market indexing as an investment strategy.
In 1976, his Newsweekcolumn applauded my cre-
ation of the world’s first index mutual fund. In
1993, he wrote the foreword to my first book, and
in 1999 he provided a powerful endorsement for my
second. Now in his ninety-second year, he remains
my mentor, my inspiration, my shining light.

Don’t Allow a Winner’s Game
to Become a Loser’s Game.
S
UCCESSFUL INVESTING IS ALL about common sense.
As the Oracle has said, it is simple, but it is not easy.
Simple arithmetic suggests, and history confirms, that the
winning strategy is to own all of the nation’s publicly held
businesses at very low cost. By doing so you are guaran-
teed to capture almost the entire return that they gener-
ate in the form of dividends and earnings growth.
The best way to implement this strategy is indeed sim-
ple: Buying a fund that holds this market portfolio, and hold-
ing it forever. Such a fund is called an index fund. The index
fund is simply a basket (portfolio) that holds many, many
eggs (stocks) designed to mimic the overall performance of

any financial market or market sector.* Classic index funds,
by definition, basically represent the entire stock market bas-
ket, not just a few scattered eggs. Such funds eliminate the
risk of individual stocks, the risk of market sectors, and
the risk of manager selection, with only stock market risk re-
maining (which is quite large enough, thank you). Index
funds make up for their short-term lack of excitement by
their truly exciting long-term productivity.

Index funds eliminate the risks of
individual stocks, market sectors, and manager
selection. Only stock market risk remains.
This is much more than a book about index funds. It is a
book that is determined to change the very way that you
think about investing. For when you understand how our
financial markets actually work, you will see that the
index fund is indeed the only investment that guarantees
you will capture your fair share of the returns that busi-
ness earns. Thanks to the miracle of compounding, the
*Keep in mind that an index may also be constructed around bonds and the
bond market, or even “road less traveled” asset classes such as commodities
or real estate. Today, if you wish, you could literally hold all your wealth in
a diversified set of index funds representing asset classes within the United
States or the global economy.

INTRODUCTION [XIII]
accumulations of wealth over the years generated by those
returns have been little short of fantastic.
I’m speaking here about the classic index fund, one
that is broadly diversified, holding all (or almost all) of its
share of the $15 trillion capitalization of the U.S. stock
market, operating with minimal expenses and without ad-
visory fees, with tiny portfolio turnover, and with high tax
efficiency. The index fund simply owns corporate Amer-
ica, buying an interest in each stock in the stock market
in proportion to its market capitalization and then holding
it forever.
Please don’t underestimate the power of compounding
the generous returns earned by our businesses. Over the
past century, our corporations have earned a return on their
capital of 9.5 percent per year. Compounded at that rate
over a decade, each $1 initially invested grows to $2.48;
over two decades, $6.14; over three decades, $15.22; over
four decades, $37.72, and over five decades, $93.48.* The
magic of compounding is little short of a miracle. Simply
put, thanks to the growth, productivity, resourcefulness,
and innovation of our corporations, capitalism creates
*These accumulations are measured in nominaldollars, with no adjustment
for the long-term decline in their buying power, averaging about 3 percent
a year since the twentieth century began. If we use real (inflation-adjusted)
dollars, the return drops from 9.5 percent to 6.5 percent. As a result, the
accumulations of an initial investment of $1 would be $1.88, $3.52, $6.61,
$12.42, and $23.31 for the respective periods.

wealth, a positive-sum game for its owners. Investing in eq-
uities is a winner’s game.
The returns earned by business are ultimately trans-
lated into the returns earned by the stock market. I have
no way of knowing what share of these returns you have
earned in the past. But academic studies suggest that if
you are a typical investor in individual stocks, your re-
turns have probably lagged the market by about 2.5 per-
centage points per year. Applying that figure to the
annual return of 12 percent earned over the past 25
years by the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index, your
annual return has been less than 10 percent. Result:
your slice of the market pie, as it were, has been less
than 80 percent. In addition, as explained in Chapter 5,
if you are a typical investor in mutual funds, you’ve
done even worse.
If you don’t believe that is what most investors expe-
rience, please think for a moment, about the relentless
rules of humble arithmetic. These iron rules define the
game. As investors, all of us as a group earn the stock
market’s return. As a group—I hope you’re sitting down
for this astonishing revelation—we are average. Each
extra return that one of us earns means that another of
our fellow investors suffers a return shortfall of precisely
the same dimension. Before the deduction of the costs of
investing, beating the stock market is a zero-sum game.

INTRODUCTION [XV]
But the costs of playing the investment game both
reduce the gains of the winners and increases the
losses of the losers. So who wins? You know who wins.
The man in the middle (actually, the men and women
in the middle, the brokers, the investment bankers, the
money managers, the marketers, the lawyers, the ac-
countants, the operations departments of our financial
system) is the only sure winner in the game of invest-
ing. Our financial croupiers always win. In the casino,
the house always wins. In horse racing, the track al-
ways wins. In the powerball lottery, the state always
wins. Investing is no different. After the deduction of
the costs of investing, beating the stock market is a
loser’s game.
Yes, after the costs of financial intermediation—all
those brokerage commissions, portfolio transaction
costs, and fund operating expenses; all those investment
management fees; all those advertising dollars and all
those marketing schemes; and all those legal costs and
custodial fees that we pay, day after day and year after
year—beating the market is inevitably a game for losers.
No matter how many books are published and promoted
purporting to show how easy it is to win, investors fall
short. Indeed, when we add the costs of these self-help
investment books into the equation, it becomes even
more of a loser’s game.

(cid:2)
Don’t allow a winner’s game
to become a loser’s game.
The wonderful magic of compounding returns that is
reflected in the long-term productivity of American busi-
ness, then, is translated into equally wonderful returns in
the stock market. But those returns are overwhelmed by
the powerful tyranny of compounding the costs of invest-
ing. For those who choose to play the game, the odds in
favor of the successful achievement of superior returns
are terrible. Simply playing the game consigns the aver-
age investor to a woeful shortfall to the returns generated
by the stock market over the long term.
Most investors in stocks think that they can avoid
the pitfalls of investing by due diligence and knowledge,
trading stocks with alacrity to stay one step ahead of the
game. But while the investors who trade the least have a
fighting chance of capturing the market’s return, those
who trade the most are doomed to failure. An academic
study showed that the most active one-fifth of all stock
traders turned their portfolios over at the rate of more
than 21 percent per month. While they earned the mar-
ket return of 17.9 percent per year during the period
1990 to 1996, they incurred trading costs of about 6.5
percent, leaving them with an annual return of but 11.4

percent, only two-thirds of the return in that strong
market upsurge.
(cid:2)
Fund investors are confident that they can easily
select superior fund managers. They are wrong.
Mutual fund investors, too, have inflated ideas of
their own omniscience. They pick funds based on the re-
cent performance superiority of fund managers, or even
their long-term superiority, and hire advisers to help them
do the same thing. But, the advisers do it with even less
success (see Chapters 8, 9, and 10). Oblivious of the toll
taken by costs, fund investors willingly pay heavy sales
loads and incur excessive fund fees and expenses, and are
unknowingly subjected to the substantial but hidden
transaction costs incurred by funds as a result of their hy-
peractive portfolio turnover. Fund investors are confident
that they can easily select superior fund managers. They
are wrong.
Contrarily, for those who invest and then drop out of
the game and never pay a single unnecessary cost, the odds
in favor of success are awesome. Why? Simply because they
own businesses, and businesses as a group earn substantial
returns on their capital and pay out dividends to their own-
ers. Yes, many individual companies fail. Firms with flawed
ideas and rigid strategies and weak managements ultimately

fall victim to the creative destructionthat is the hallmark of
competitive capitalism, only to be succeeded by others.*
But in the aggregate, businesses grow with the long-term
growth of our vibrant economy.
This book will tell you why you should stop contribut-
ing to the croupiers of the financial markets, who rake in
something like $400 billion each year from you and your
fellow investors. It will also tell you how easy it is to do
just that: simply buy the entire stock market. Then, once
you have bought your stocks, get out of the casino and
stay out. Just hold the market portfolio forever. And
that’s what the index fund does.
This investment philosophy is not only simple and ele-
gant. The arithmetic on which it is based is irrefutable. But
it is not easy to follow its discipline. So long as we investors
accept the status quo of today’s crazy-quilt financial market
system; so long as we enjoy the excitement (however costly)
of buying and selling stocks; so long as we fail to realize that
there is a better way, such a philosophy will seem counterin-
tuitive. But I ask you to carefully consider the impassioned
message of this little book. When you do, you, too, will
want to join the revolution and invest in a new, more eco-
nomical, more efficient, even more honest way, a more pro-
ductive way that will put your own interest first.
*“Creative destruction” is the formulation of Joseph E. Schumpeter in
Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy,1942.

INTRODUCTION [XIX]
It may seem farfetched for me to hope that any single
little book could ignite the spark of a revolution in invest-
ing. New ideas that fly in the face of the conventional wis-
dom of the day are always greeted with doubt, scorn, and
even fear. Indeed, 230 years ago the same challenge was
faced by Thomas Paine, whose 1776 tract Common
Sense helped spark the American Revolution. Here is
what Tom Paine wrote:
Perhaps the sentiments contained in the following
pages are not yet sufficiently fashionable to procure
them general favor; a long habit of not thinking a thing
wrong, gives it a superficial appearance of being right,
and raises at first a formidable outcry in defense of cus-
tom. But the tumult soon subsides. Time makes more
converts than reason.
In the following pages, I offer nothing more than
simple facts, plain arguments, and common sense; and
have no other preliminaries to settle with the reader,
than that he will divest himself of prejudice and prepos-
session, and suffer his reason and his feelings to deter-
mine for themselves; that he will put on, or rather that
he will not put off, the true character of a man, and
generously enlarge his views beyond the present day.
As we now know, Thomas Paine’s powerful and artic-
ulate arguments carried the day. The American Revolu-
tion led to our Constitution, which to this day defines the
responsibility of our government, our citizens, and the
fabric of our society. Inspired by his words, I titled my

[XX] INTRODUCTION
1999 book Common Sense on Mutual Funds, and asked
investors to divest themselves of prejudice and to gener-
ously enlarge their views beyond the present day. In this
new book, I reiterate that proposition.
(cid:2)
If I “could only explain things to enough people,
carefully enough, thoroughly enough,
thoughtfully enough—why, eventually everyone
would see, and then everything would be fixed.”
In Common Sense on Mutual Funds,I also applied to
my idealistic self these words of the late journalist
Michael Kelly: “The driving dream (of the idealist) is that
if he could only explain things to enough people, carefully
enough, thoroughly enough, thoughtfully enough—why,
eventually everyone would see, and then everything would
be fixed.” This book is my attempt to explain the financial
system to as many of you who will listen carefully enough,
thoroughly enough, and thoughtfully enough so that you
will see, and it will be fixed. Or at least that your own par-
ticipation in it will be fixed.
Some may suggest that, as the creator both of Van-
guard in 1974 and of the world’s first index mutual fund
in 1975, I have a vested interest in persuading you of my
views. Of course I do! But not because it enriches me to
do so. It doesn’t earn me a penny. Rather, I want to per-

INTRODUCTION [XXI]
suade you because the very elements that formed Van-
guard’s foundation all those years ago—all those values
and structures and strategies—will enrich you.
In the early years of indexing, my voice was a lonely
one. But there were a few other thoughtful and re-
spected believers whose ideas inspired me to carry on
my mission. Today, many of the wisest and most suc-
cessful investors endorse the index fund concept, and
among academics, the acceptance is close to universal.
But don’t take my word for it. Listen to these indepen-
dent experts with no axe to grind except for the truth
about investing. You’ll hear from some of them at the
end of each chapter.
Listen, for example, to this endorsement by Paul A.
Samuelson, Nobel Laureate and professor of economics
at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to whom this
book is dedicated: “Bogle’s reasoned precepts can enable
a few million of us savers to become in twenty years the
envy of our suburban neighbors—while at the same time
we have slept well in these eventful times.”
Put another way, in the words of the Shaker hymn,
“Tis the gift to be simple, tis the gift to be free, tis the
gift to come down where we ought to be.” Adapting this
message to investing by simply owning an index fund, you
will be free of almost all of the excessive costs of our fi-
nancial system, and will receive, when it comes time to

[XXII] INTRODUCTION
draw on the savings you have accumulated, the gift of
coming down just where you ought to be.
The financial system, alas, won’t be fixed for a long
time. But the glacial nature of that change doesn’t pre-
vent you from looking after your self-interest. You don’t
need to participate in its expensive foolishness. If you
choose to play the winner’s game of owning businesses
and refrain from playing the loser’s game of trying to beat
the market, you can begin the task simply by using your
own common sense, understanding the system, and in-
vesting in accordance with the only principles that will
eliminate substantially all of its excessive costs. Then, at
last, whatever returns our businesses may be generous
enough to deliver in the years ahead, reflected as they will
be in our stock and bond markets, you will be guaranteed
to earn your fair share. When you understand these reali-
ties, you’ll see that it’s all about common sense.

INTRODUCTION [XXIII]
Don’t Take My Word for It
Charles T. Munger, Warren Buffett’s partner at
Berkshire Hathaway, puts it this way: “The general
systems of money management [today] require peo-
ple to pretend to do something they can’t do and
like something they don’t. [It’s] a funny business be-
cause on a net basis, the whole investment manage-
ment business together gives no value added to all
buyers combined. That’s the way it has to work.Mu-
tual funds charge two percent per year and then bro-

three to four percentage points. The poor guy in the
general public is getting a terrible product from the

William Bernstein, investment adviser (and
neurologist), and author of The Four Pillars of In-

market risk. Only a fool takes on the additional
risk of doing yet more damage by failing to diver-
sify properly with his or her nest egg. Avoid the
problem—buy a well-run index fund and own the
whole market.”

have offered extremely poor value for money. Their

records of outperformance are almost always fol-
lowed by stretches of underperformance. Over long
periods of time, hardly any fund managers have
beaten the market averages. They encourage in-
vestors, rather than spread their risks wisely or seek
the best match for their future liabilities, to put their
money into the most modish assets going, often just
when they become overvalued. And all the while
they charge their clients big fees for the privilege of
losing their money....(One) specific lesson...is
the merits of indexed investing...you will almost
never find a fund manager who can repeatedly beat
the market. It is better to invest in an indexed fund
that promises a market return but with significantly
lower fees.”
The Little Book readers interested in reviewing the original
sources for the “Don’t Take My Word for It” quotes, found at
the end of each chapter, and other quotes in the main text, can
find them on my website: www.johncbogle.com. I wouldn’t
dream of consuming valuable pages in this book with a weighty
bibliography, so please don’t hesitate to visit my website. It’s re-
ally amazing that so many giants of academe and many of the
world’s greatest investors, known for beating the market, con-
firm and applaud the virtues of index investing. May their com-
mon sense, perhaps even more than my own, make you all wiser
investors.

The Gotrocks Family

VEN BEFORE YOU THINK about “index funds”—
in their most basic form, mutual funds that simply buy
all the stocks in the U.S. stock market and hold them
forever—you must understand how the stock market
actually works. Perhaps this homely parable—my ver-
sion of a story told by Warren Buffett, chairman
of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., in the firm’s 2005
Annual Report—will clarify the foolishness and coun-
terproductivity of our vast and complex financial mar-
ket system.

[2] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING
Once upon a Time ...
A wealthy family named the Gotrocks, grown over the gen-
erations to include thousands of brothers, sisters, aunts,
uncles, and cousins, owned 100 percent of every stock in
the United States. Each year, they reaped the rewards of
investing: all the earnings growth that those thousands of
corporations generated and all the dividends that they dis-
tributed.* Each family member grew wealthier at the same
pace, and all was harmonious. Their investment had com-
pounded over the decades, creating enormous wealth, be-
cause the Gotrocks family was playing a winner’s game.
But after a while, a few fast-talking Helpers arrive on
the scene, and they persuade some “smart” Gotrocks
cousins that they can earn a larger share than the other
relatives. These Helpers convince the cousins to sell
some of their shares in the companies to other family
members and to buy some shares of others from them in
return. The Helpers handle the transactions, and as bro-
kers, they receive commissions for their services. The
ownership is thus rearranged among the family members.
To their surprise, however, the family wealth begins to
grow at a slower pace. Why? Because some of the return is
now consumed by the Helpers, and the family’s share of the
*To complicate matters just a bit, the Gotrocks family also purchased the
new public offerings of securities that were issued each year.

generous pie that U.S. industry bakes each year—all those
dividends paid, all those earnings reinvested in the busi-
ness—100 percent at the outset, starts to decline, simply be-
cause some of the return is now consumed by the Helpers.
To make matters worse, while the family had always
paid taxes on their dividends, some of the members are
now also paying taxes on the capital gains they realize
from their stock-swapping back and forth, further dimin-
ishing the family’s total wealth.
The smart cousins quickly realize that their plan has
actually diminished the rate of growth in the family’s
wealth. They recognize that their foray into stock-picking
has been a failure and conclude that they need profes-
sional assistance, the better to pick the right stocks for
themselves. So they hire stock-picking experts—more
Helpers!—to gain an advantage. These money managers
charge a fee for their services. So when the family ap-
praises its wealth a year later, it finds that its share of the
pie has diminished even further.
To make matters still worse, the new managers feel
compelled to earn their keep by trading the family’s
stocks at feverish levels of activity, not only increasing
the brokerage commissions paid to the first set of
Helpers, but running up the tax bill as well. Now the
family’s earlier 100 percent share of the dividend and
earnings pie is further diminished.

“Well, we failed to pick good stocks for ourselves,
and when that didn’t work, we also failed to pick man-
agers who could do so,” the smart cousins say. “What
shall we do?” Undeterred by their two previous failures,
they decide to hire still more Helpers. They retain the
best investment consultants and financial planners they
can find to advise them on how to select the right man-
agers, who will then surely pick the right stocks. The
consultants, of course, tell them they can do exactly that.
“Just pay us a fee for our services,” the new Helpers as-
sure the cousins, “and all will be well.” Alas, the family’s
share of the pie tumbles once again.
(cid:2)
Get rid of all your Helpers. Then our family will
again reap 100 percent of the pie that Corporate
America bakes for us.
Alarmed at last, the family sits down together and
takes stock of the events that have transpired since some
of them began to try to outsmart the others. “How is it,”
they ask, “that our original 100 percent share of the pie—
made up each year of all those dividends and earnings—
has dwindled to just 60 percent?” Their wisest member, a
sage old uncle, softly responds: “All that money you’ve
paid to those Helpers and all those unnecessary extra
taxes you’re paying come directly out of our family’s total

earnings and dividends. Go back to square one, and do so
immediately. Get rid of all your brokers. Get rid of all
your money managers. Get rid of all your consultants.
Then our family will again reap 100 percent of however
large a pie that corporate America bakes for us, year
after year.”
They followed the old uncle’s wise advice, returning
to their original passive but productive strategy, holding
all the stocks of corporate America, and standing pat.
That is exactly what an index fund does.
... and the Gotrocks Family Lived Happily
Ever After
Adding a fourth law to Sir Isaac Newton’s three laws of
motion, the inimitable Warren Buffett puts the moral of
the story this way: For investors as a whole, returns de-
crease as motion increases.
Accurate as that cryptic statement is, I would add
that the parable reflects the profound conflict of interest
between those who work in the investment business and
those who invest in stocks and bonds. The way to wealth
for those in the business is to persuade their clients,
“Don’t just stand there. Do something.” But the way to
wealth for their clients in the aggregate is to follow the
opposite maxim: “Don’t do something. Just stand there.”
For that is the only way to avoid playing the loser’s game

of trying to beat the market. When any business is con-
ducted in a way that directly defies the interests of its
clients in the aggregate, it is only a matter of time until
change comes.
The moral of the story, then, is that successful invest-
ing is about owning businesses and reaping the huge re-
wards provided by the dividends and earnings growth of
our nation’s—and, for that matter, the world’s—corpora-
tions. The higher the level of their investment activity,
the greater the cost of financial intermediation and taxes,
the less the net return that the business owners as a group
receive. The lower the costs that investors as a group
incur, the higher rewards that they reap. So to realize the
winning returns generated by businesses over the long
term, the intelligent investor will minimize to the bare
bones the costs of financial intermediation. That’s what
common sense tells us. That’s what indexing is all about.
And that’s what this book is all about.
Don’t Take My Word for It
Listen to Jack R. Meyer, former president of Har-
vard Management Company, the remarkably suc-
cessful wizard who tripled the Harvard endowment
fund from $8 billion to $27 billion. Here’s what he
had to say in a 2004 Business Week interview: “The

investment business is a giant scam. Most people
think they can find managers who can outperform,
but most people are wrong. I will say that 85 to 90
percent of managers fail to match their benchmarks.
Because managers have fees and incur transaction
costs, you know that in the aggregate they are delet-
ing value.” When asked if private investors can draw
any lessons from what Harvard does, Mr. Meyer re-
sponded, “Yes. First, get diversified. Come up with
a portfolio that covers a lot of asset classes. Second,
you want to keep your fees low. That means avoid-
ing the most hyped but expensive funds, in favor of
low-cost index funds. And finally, invest for the
long term. [Investors] should simply have index
funds to keep their fees low and their taxes down.
No doubt about it.”
In terms that are a bit more academic, Princeton
professor Burton G. Malkiel, author of A Random
Walk Down Wall Street, expresses these views:
“Index funds have regularly produced rates of re-
turn exceeding those of active managers by close to
2 percentage points. Active management as a whole
cannot achieve gross returns exceeding the market as a
while and therefore they must, on average, underper-
form the indexes by the amount of these expense and
transaction costs disadvantages.

“Experience conclusively shows that index-fund
buyers are likely to obtain results exceeding those of
the typical fund manager, whose large advisory fees
and substantial portfolio turnover tend to reduce in-
vestment yields. Many people will find the guarantee
of playing the stock-market game at par every round a
very attractive one. The index fund is a sensible, serv-
iceable method for obtaining the market’s rate of re-
turn with absolutely no effort and minimal expense.”

“The most that owners in the aggregate can earn between

the point with Berkshire Hathaway, the publicly owned in-
vestment company he has run for 40 years, Buffett says,
“When the stock temporarily overperforms or underper-
forms the business, a limited number of shareholders—
either sellers or buyers—receive out-sized benefits at the
expense of those they trade with. [But] over time, the

aggregate gains made by Berkshire shareholders must of
necessity match the business gains of the company.”
(cid:2)
“Overtime,theaggregategainsmadeby
shareholdersmustofnecessitymatchthe
businessgainsofthecompany.”
How often investors lose sight of that eternal principle!
Yet the record is clear. History, if only we would take the
trouble to look at it, reveals the remarkable, if essential,
linkage between the cumulative long-term returns earned by
business—the annual dividend yield plus the annual rate of
earnings growth—and the cumulative returns earned by the
U.S. stock market. Think about that certainty for a mo-
ment. Can you see that it is simple common sense?
Need proof? Just look at the record since the twenti-
eth century began (Exhibit 2.1). The average annual total
return on stocks was 9.6 percent, virtually identical to the
investment return of 9.5 percent—4.5 percent from divi-
dend yield and 5 percent from earnings growth. That tiny
difference of 0.1 percent per year arose from what I call
speculative return. Depending on how one looks at it, it is
merely statistical noise, or perhaps it reflects a generally
upward long-term trend in stock valuations, a willingness
of investors to pay higher prices for each dollar of earn-
ings at the end of the period than at the beginning.

Compounding these returns over 106 years produced
accumulations that are truly staggering. Each dollar ini-
tially invested in 1900 at an investment return of 9.5 per-
cent grew by the close of 2005 to $15,062.* Sure, few (if
any) of us have 106 years in us, but, like the Gotrocks
family over the generations, the miracle of compounding
returns is little short of amazing—it is perhaps the ulti-
mate winner’s game.
*But let’s be fair. If we compound that initial $1, not at the nominal return
of 9.5 percent but at the real (after-inflation) rate of 6.5 percent, the accu-
mulation grows to $793. But increasing real wealth nearly 800 times over is
not to be sneezed at.

[12] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING
As Exhibit 2.1 makes clear, there are bumps along
the way in the investment returns earned by our business
corporations. Sometimes, as in the Great Depression of
the early 1930s, these bumps are large. But we get over
them. So, if you stand back from the chart and squint
your eyes, the trend of business fundamentals looks al-
most like a straight line sloping gently upward, and those
periodic bumps are barely visible.
Stock market returns sometimes get well ahead of
business fundamentals (as in the late 1920s, the early
1970s, the late 1990s). But it has been only a matter of
time until, as if drawn by a magnet, they soon return, al-
though often only after falling well behind for a time (as
in the mid-1940s, the late 1970s, the 2003 market lows).
In our foolish focus on the short-term stock market
distractions of the moment, we, too, often overlook this
long history. We ignore that when the returns on stocks
depart materially from the long-term norm, it is rarely be-
cause of the economics of investing—the earnings growth
and dividend yields of our corporations. Rather, the rea-
son that annual stock returns are so volatile is largely be-
cause of the emotions of investing.
We can measure these emotions by the price/earnings
(P/E) ratio, which measures the number of dollars in-
vestors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings. As
investor confidence waxes and wanes, P/E multiples rise

and fall.* When greed holds sway, we see very high P/Es.
When hope prevails, P/Es are moderate. When fear is in
the saddle, P/Es are very low. Back and forth, over and
over again, swings in the emotions of investors momentar-
ily derail the steady long-range upward trend in the eco-
nomics of investing.
(cid:2)
“It is dangerous . . . to apply to the future
inductive arguments based on past experience.”
What Exhibit 2.1 shows is that while the prices we
pay for stocks often lose touch with the reality of corpo-
rate values, in the long run, reality rules. So, while in-
vestors seem to intuitively accept that the past is
inevitably prologue to the future, any past stock market
returns that have included a high speculative stock re-
turn component are a deeply flawed guide to what lies
ahead. To understand why past returns do not foretell
the future, we need only heed the words of the great
British economist John Maynard Keynes, written 70
years ago: “It is dangerous . . . to apply to the future in-
ductive arguments based on past experience, unless one
can distinguish the broad reasons why past experience
was what it was.”
*Changes in interest rates also have an impact, uneven though it may be,
on the P/E multiple. So, I’m oversimplifying a bit here.

[14] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING
But if we can distinguish the reasons the past was
what it was, then, we can establish reasonable expecta-
tions about the future. Keynes helped us make this dis-
tinction by pointing out that the state of long-term
expectation for stocks is a combination of enterprise
(“forecasting the prospective yield of assets over their
whole life”) and speculation (“forecasting the psychology
of the market”). I’m well familiar with those words, for 55
years ago I incorporated them in my senior thesis at
Princeton, written (providentially for my lifetime career
that followed) on the mutual fund industry. It was enti-
tled, “The Economic Role of the Investment Company.”
This dual nature of returns is reflected when we look
at stock market returns over the decades. Using Keynes’s
idea, I divide stock market returns into two parts: (1) In-
vestment Return (enterprise), consisting of the initial div-
idend yield on stocks plus their subsequent earnings
growth, which together form the essence of what we call
“intrinsic value”; and (2) Speculative Return, the impact
of changing price/earnings multiples on stock prices.
Let’s begin with investment returns. Exhibit 2.2 shows
the average annual investment return on stocks over the
decades since 1900. Note first the steady contribution of
dividend yields to total return during each decade; always
positive, only once outside the range of 3 percent to 7 per-
cent, and averaging 4.5 percent. Then note that the con-

tribution of earnings growth to investment return, with
the exception of the depression-ridden 1930s, was positive

percent, and averaging 5 percent per year. Result: Total
investment returns (the top line, combining dividend yield
and earnings growth) were negative in only a single decade

10 to 20 times over a decade, would equate to a 7.2 per-
cent annual speculative return. Curiously, without excep-
tion, every decade of significantly negative speculative
return was immediately followed by a decade in which it
turned positive by a correlative amount—the quiet 1910s
and then the roaring 1920s, the dispiriting 1940s and
then the booming 1950s, the discouraging 1970s and
then the soaring 1980s—reversion to the mean (RTM)
writ large. (Reversion to the mean can be thought of as
the tendency for stock returns to return to their long-term
norms over time—periods of exceptional returns tend to
be followed by periods of below average performance, and
vice versa.) Then, amazingly, there is an unprecedented
second consecutive exuberant increase in speculative re-
turn in the 1990s, a pattern never before in evidence.
By the close of 1999, the P/E rate had risen to an un-
precedented level 32 times, setting the stage for the return
to sanity in valuations that soon followed. The tumble in

stock market prices gave us our comeuppance. With earn-
ings continuing to rise, the P/E currently stands at 18 times,
compared with the 15 times level that prevailed at the start
of the twentieth century. As a result, speculative return has
added just 0.1 percentage points to the annual investment
return earned by our businesses over the long term.

turns, we get the total return produced by the stock mar-
ket (Exhibit 2.4). Despite the huge impact of speculative

return—up and down—during most of the individual
decades, there is virtually no impact over the long term.
The average annual total return on stocks of 9.6 percent,
then, has been created almost entirely by enterprise, with
only 0.1 percentage point created by speculation. The
message is clear: in the long run, stock returns depend al-
most entirely on the reality of the investment returns
earned by our corporations. The perception of investors,
reflected by the speculative returns, counts for little. It is
economics that controls long-term equity returns; emo-
tions, so dominant in the short-term, dissolve.
(cid:2)
Accurately forecasting swings in investor
emotions is not possible. But forecasting the
long-term economics of investing carries
remarkably high odds of success.
After more than 55 years in this business, I have ab-
solutely no idea how to forecast these swings in investor
emotions.* But, largely because the arithmetic of investing
is so basic, I can forecast the long-term economics of invest-
ing with remarkably high odds of success. Why? Simply, it is
*I’m not alone. I don’t know anyone who has done so successfully, or even
anyone who knows anyone who has done so. In fact, 70 years of financial re-
search show that no one has done so.

investment returns—the earnings and dividends generated by
American business—that are almost entirely responsible for
the returns delivered in our stock market. Put another way,
while illusion (the momentary prices we pay for stocks) often
loses touch with reality (the intrinsic values of our corpora-
tions), in the long run it is reality that rules.
To drive this point home, think of investing as consisting
of two different games. Here’s how Roger Martin, dean of
the Rotman School of Management of the University of
Toronto, describes them. One is “the real market, where
giant publicly held companies compete. Where real com-
panies spend real money to make and sell real products and
services, and, if they play with skill, earn real profits and pay
real dividends. This game also requires real strategy, deter-
mination, and expertise; real innovation and real foresight.”
Loosely linked to this game is another game, the ex-
pectations market. Here, “prices are not set by real
things like sales margins or profits. In the short-term,
stock prices go up only when the expectations of investors
rise, not necessarily when sales, margins, or profits rise.”
(cid:2)
The stock market is a giant distraction.
To this crucial distinction, I would add that the expec-
tations market is not only a product of the expectations of
active investors but the expectations of active speculators,

trying to guess what these investors will expect, and how
they will act as each new bit of information finds its way
into the marketplace. The expectations market is about
speculation. The real market is about investing. The only
logical conclusion: the stock market is a giant distraction
that causes investors to focus on transitory and volatile in-
vestment expectations rather than on what is really impor-
tant—the gradual accumulation of the returns earned by
corporate business.
My advice to investors is to ignore the short-term
noise of the emotions reflected in our financial markets
and focus on the productive long-term economics of our
corporate businesses. Shakespeare could have been de-

essential reality of investing: “In the short run the stock
market is a voting machine...(but) in the long run it is
a weighing machine.”Ben Graham continues, using his
wonderful metaphor of “Mr. Market.” “The investor
with a portfolio of sound stocks should expect their
prices to fluctuate and should neither be concerned
by sizable declines nor become excited by sizable ad-
vances. He should always remember that market quo-
tations are there for his convenience, either to be
taken advantage of or to be ignored.
“Imagine that in some private business you own a
small share which cost you $1,000. One of your part-
ners, named Mr. Market, is very obliging indeed.
Every day he tells you what he thinks your interest is
worth and furthermore offers either to buy you out
or to sell you an additional interest on that basis.
Sometimes his idea of value appears plausible and
justified by business developments and prospects.
Often, on the other hand, Mr. Market lets his enthu-
siasm or his fears run away with him, and the value he
proposes seems little short of silly.
“If you are a prudent investor will you let Mr.
Market’s daily communication determine your view
as the value of your $1,000 interest in the enter-
prise? Only in case you agree with him or in case
you want to trade with him. Most of the time you

O HOW DO YOU cast your lot with business? Simply by
buying a portfolio that owns the shares of every business
in the United States and then holding it forever. It is a
simple concept that guarantees you will win the invest-
ment game played by most other investors who—as a
group—are guaranteed to lose.
Please don’t equate simplicity with stupidity. Way back
in 1320, William of Occam expressed it well, essentially set-
ting forth this precept: When there are multiple solutions to

a problem, choose the simplest one.* And so Occam’s
Razor came to represent a major principle of scientific in-
quiry. By far the simplest way to own all of U.S. business is
to hold the total stock market portfolio.
(cid:2)
Occam’s Razor: When there are multiple
solutions to a problem, choose the simplest one.
For most of the past 80 years, the accepted stock mar-
ket portfolio was represented by the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index (the S&P 500), which was created in 1926 and
now lists 500 stocks. It is essentially composed of the 500
largest U.S. corporations, weighted by the value of their
market capitalizations.† In recent years, these 500 stocks
have represented about 80 percent of the market value of
all U.S. stocks. The beauty of such a cap-weighted index
is that it automatically adjusts to changing stock prices and
never has to buy and sell stocks for that reason.
With the enormous growth of corporate pension funds
between 1950 and 1990, it was an ideal measurement stan-
dard, the benchmark or hurdle rate that would be the com-
parative standard for how their professional managers were
performing. Today, the S&P 500 remains a valid standard
*William of Occam expressed it more elegantly: “Entities should not be
multiplied unnecessarily.” But the point is unmistakable.
†The S&P Index originally included just 90 companies, rising to 500 in 1957.

against which to compare the returns earned by the profes-
sional managers of pension funds and mutual funds.
In 1970, an even more comprehensive measure of the
U.S. stock market was developed. Originally called the
Wilshire 5000, it is now named the Dow Jones Wilshire
Total Stock Market Index. It includes some 4,971 stocks, in-
cluding the 500 stocks in the S&P 500. However, because
its component stocks also are weighted by their market cap-
italization, those remaining 4,471 stocks account for only
about 20 percent of its value. Nonetheless, this broadest of
all U.S. stock indexes is the best measure of the aggregate
value of stocks, and therefore a superb measure of the re-
turns earned in U.S. stocks by all investors as a group.
The two indexes have a similar composition. Exhibit
3.1 shows the 12 largest stocks in each, and their weight
in the construction of each index.
Given the similarity of these two portfolios, it is hardly
surprising that the two indexes have earned returns that are
in lockstep with one another. The Center for Research in Se-
curity Prices at the University of Chicago has gone back to
1926 and calculated the returns earned by all U.S. stocks.
(Its data since 1970 have provided a virtually perfect match
to the Total Stock Market Index.) In fact, returns of the two
indexes parallel one another with near precision. From
1928, the beginning of the measurement period, through
2006, you can hardly tell them apart (Exhibit3.2).

For the full period, the average annual return on the
S&P 500 was 10.3 percent; the return on the Total Stock
Market Index was 10.1 percent. This represents what we
call a period dependentoutcome—everything depends on the
starting date and the ending date. If we were to begin the
comparison at the beginning of 1930 instead of 1926, the re-
turns of the two would be identical: 9.9 percent per year.
Yes, there are variations over the interim periods: the
S&P 500 was much the stronger from 1982 to 1990,
when its annual return of 15.6 percent outpaced the Total
Stock Market Index return of 14.0 percent. But in recent
years (1998 to 2006), small- and mid-cap stocks did bet-
ter, and the Total Stock Market Index return of 3.4 per-
cent per year nicely exceeded the 2.4 percent return of

the S&P 500. But with a long-term correlation of 0.98
between the returns of the two indexes (1.0 is perfect cor-
relation), there is little to choose between them.
Whichever measure we use, it should now be obvious
that the returns earned by the publicly held corporations
that compose the stock market must of necessity equal
the aggregate gross returns earned by all investors in that
market as a group. Equally obvious, as discussed in Chap-
ter 4, the net returns earned by these investors must of
necessity fall short of those aggregate gross returns by
the amount of intermediation costs they incur. Our com-
mon sense tells us the obvious; while owning the stock
market over the long term is a winner’s game, beating the
stock market is a loser’s game.
(cid:2)
If the data do not prove that indexing wins, well,
the data are wrong.
Such an all-market fund is guaranteed to outpace over
time the returns earned by equity investors as a group.
Once you recognize this fact, you can see that the index
fund is guaranteed to win not only over time, but every
year, and every month and week, even every minute of the
day. Because no matter how long or short the time frame,
the gross return in the stock market, minus intermedia-
tion costs, equals the net return earned by investors as a

group. If the data do not prove that indexing wins, well,
the data are wrong.
Over the short term, however, it doesn’t always look as
if the S&P 500 (still the most common basis of comparison
for mutual funds and pension plans) or the Total Stock
Market Index is winning. That is because there is no pos-
sible way to calculate the returns earned by the millions of
diverse participants, amateur and professional alike, Amer-
icans and foreign investors, in the U.S. stock market.
So what we do in the mutual fund field is calculate
the returns of the various funds, counting each fund—
instead of each fund’s assets—as one entry. Since there
are many small-cap and mid-cap funds, usually with rel-
atively modest asset bases, they make a disproportion-
ate impact on the data. When small- and mid-
cap funds are leading the total market, the all-market
index fund seems to lag. When small- and mid-
cap stocks are lagging the market, the index fund looks
formidable indeed.
Nonetheless, the exercise of calculating how the re-
turns earned by the stock market compare with returns
earned by the average equity fund is both illuminating and
persuasive (Exhibit 3.3). If we compare the results of
what are described as “large-cap core” funds with the re-
turns of the S&P 500 (because of its market capitalization
weightings, a “large-cap core” index), the advantage of
the S&P Index is impressive.

During the 39-year period 1968 to 2006, the S&P
500 fell into the bottom quartile in only two years (and
has not done so since 1979). The Index has outpaced the
average fund in 26 of the remaining 35 years, including 11
of the past 15 years. Its average ranking was in the 58th
percentile (outperforming 58 percent of the comparable
actively managed funds), leading, as we will show in
Chapter 4, to enormous superiority over time. It is hard
to imagine that even a single one of the large-cap core eq-
uity funds has a similar record of consistency.
Consistency matters. A fund that is good or very good
in the vast majority of years produces a far larger long-
term return than a fund that is superb in half the years and
a disaster in the remaining half. Single-year rankings,

then, ignore the sheer arithmetic advantage of that consis-
tency. In the next chapter, the impact of that long-term
consistency is catalogued over the past 25 years.
These annual data are what we call survivor-biased;
they exclude the records of the inevitably poorer perform-
ing funds that regularly go out of business. As a result of
this noise in the data, the chart further understates the
success of the market-owning index strategy.
Much criticism has been heaped on the S&P 500
for often picking “new economy” stocks such as JDS
Uniphase and Yahoo! near their inflated peak prices
during the bubble, just before they crashed, thereby
taking on a growth bias at exactly the wrong time.
While the criticism is valid, the excellent long-term
record of the flawed Index belies the existence of a sig-
nificant problem. In fact, since the market peaked early
in 2000 (as shown in Exhibit 3.3), the S&P 500 has had
only a single significantly subpar year (2000), three
years at about par, and three years (2003, 2004, and
2006) in the top quartile of its peers. I imagine that the
vast majority of money managers would have been ec-
static with such an outcome.

Thus, the recent era not only has failed to erode, but has
nicelyenhancedthelifetimerecordoftheworld’sfirstindex
fund—now known as Vanguard 500 Index Fund. Let me be
specific:atadinneronSeptember20,2006,celebratingthe
30th anniversary of the fund’s initial public offering, the
counsel for the fund’s underwriters reported that he had
purchased 1,000 shares at the original offering price of
$15.00 per share—a $15,000 investment. He proudly an-
nouncedthatthevalueofhisholdingthatevening(including
sharesacquiredthroughreinvestingthefund’sdividendsand
distributions over the years) was $461,771. Now, there’s a
number that requires no comment.*
This cumulative long-term winning record confirms
that owning American business through a broadly diversi-
fied index fund is not only logical but, to say the least, in-
credibly productive. Equally important, it is consistent
with the age-old principle expressed by Sir William of
Occam: instead of joining the crowd of investors who
dabble in complex machinations to pick stocks and try to
outguess the stock market (two inevitably fruitless tasks
for investors in the aggregate), choose the simplest of all
solutions—buy and hold the market portfolio.
*Well, maybe one comment. Of the 360 equity mutual funds then in exis-
tence, only 211 remain.

Don’t Take My Word for It
Hear David Swensen, widely respected chief in-
vestment officer of the Yale University Endowment
Fund. “A minuscule 4 percent of funds produce
market-beating after-tax results with a scant 0.6 per-
cent (annual) margin of gain. The 96 percent of
funds that fail to meet or beat the Vanguard 500
Index Fund lose by a wealth-destroying margin of
4.8 percent per annum.”
The simple index fund solution has been
adopted as a cornerstone of investment strategy for
many of the nation’s pension plans operated by our
giant corporations and state and local governments.
Indexing is also the predominant strategy for the
largest of them all, the retirement plan for federal
government employees, the Federal Thrift Savings
Plan (TSP). The plan has been a remarkable suc-
cess, and now holds some $173 billion of assets for
the benefit of our public servants and members of
armed services. All contributions and earnings are
tax-deferred until withdrawal, much like the corpo-
rate 401(k) thrift plans. (Overcoming what must
have been some serious reservations, even the Bush
administration determined to follow the TSP model
in its plan for Personal Savings Accounts as an op-
tional alternative to our Social Security program.)

Indexing is also praised across the Atlantic
“pond.” Listen to these words from Jonathan
Davis, columnist for London’s The Spectator:
“Nothing highlights better the continuing gap be-
tween rhetoric and substance in British financial
services than the failure of providers here to emu-
late Jack Bogle’s index fund success in the United
States. Every professional in the City knows that
index funds should be core building blocks in any
long-term investor’s portfolio. Since 1976, the
Vanguard index fund has produced a compound
annual return of 12 percent, better than three-
quarters of its peer group. Yet even 30 years on, ig-
norance and professional omerta still stand in the
way of more investors enjoying the fruits of this un-
sung hero of the investment world.”

that investors as a group fail to earn the returns that our
corporations generate through their dividends and earnings
growth, ultimately reflected in the prices of their stocks. To
understand why they do not, we need only to recognize the
simple mathematics of investing: All investors as a group
must necessarily earn precisely the market return, but only
before the costs of investing are deducted.

After subtracting the costs of financial intermedia-
tion—all those management fees, all those brokerage
commissions, all those sales loads, all those advertising
costs, all those operating costs—the returns of investors
as a group must, and will, and do fall short of the market
return by an amount precisely equal to the aggregate
amount of those costs. In a market that returns 10 per-
cent, we investors together earn a gross return of 10 per-
cent. (Duh!) But after we pay our financial
intermediaries, we pocket only what remains. (And we
pay them whether our returns are positive or negative!)
There are, then, these two certainties: (1) Beating the
market before costs is a zero-sum game; (2) Beating the
market after costs is a loser’s game. The returns earned
by investors in the aggregate inevitably fall well short of
the returns that are realized in our financial markets. How
much do those costs come to? For individual investors
holding stocks directly, trading costs average about 1.5
percent per year. That cost is lower (about 1 percent) for
those who trade infrequently, and much higher for in-
vestors who trade frequently (for example, 3 percent for
investors who turn their portfolios over at a rate above 200
percent per year).
In equity mutual funds, management fees and operat-
ing expenses—combined, called the expense ratio—aver-

say, another 0.5 percent in sales charges, assuming that a
5 percent initial sales charge is spread over a 10-year
holding period. If the shares are held for five years, the
cost would be twice that figure—1 percent per year.
But then add a giant additional cost, all the more per-
nicious by being invisible. I am referring to the hidden cost
of portfolio turnover, estimated at a full 1 percent per year.
The average fund turns its portfolio over at a rate of about
100 percent per year, meaning that a $5 billion fund buys
$5 billion of stocks each year and sells another $5 billion.
At that rate, brokerage commissions, bid-ask spreads, and
market impact costs add a major layer of additional costs.
(cid:2)
We investors as a group get precisely what we don’t
pay for. So if we pay nothing, we get everything.
Result: the “all-in” cost of equity fund ownership can
come to as much as 3 percent to 3.5 percent per year.* So
yes, costs matter. The grim irony of investing, then, is
that we investors as a group not only don’t get what we
pay for. We get precisely what we don’t pay for. So if we
pay nothing, we get everything. It’s only common sense.
*I’ve ignored the hidden opportunity cost that fund investors pay. Most equity
funds hold about 5 percent in cash reserves. If stocks earn a 10 percent return
and these reserves earn 4 percent, that cost would add another 0.30 percent to
the annual cost (5 percent multiplied by the 6 percent differential in earnings).

[38] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING
A few years ago when I was rereading Other People’s
Money, by Louis D. Brandeis (first published in 1914), I
came across a wonderful passage that illustrates this sim-
ple lesson. Brandeis, later to become one of the most in-
fluential jurists in the history of the U.S. Supreme Court,
railed against the oligarchs who a century ago controlled
investment America and corporate America alike.
Brandeis described their self-serving financial manage-
ment and their interlocking interests as, “trampling with
impunity on laws human and divine, obsessed with the
delusion that two plus two make five.” He predicted (accu-
rately, as it turned out) that the widespread speculation of
that era would collapse, “a victim of the relentless rules of
humble arithmetic.” He then added this unattributed
warning—I’m guessing it’s from Sophocles—“Remember,
O Stranger, arithmetic is the first of the sciences, and the
mother of safety.”
Brandeis’s words hit me like the proverbial ton of
bricks. Why? Because the relentless rules of the arith-
metic of investing are so obvious. (It’s been said by my
detractors that all I have going for me is “the uncanny
ability to recognize the obvious.”) The curious fact is
that most investors seem to have difficulty recognizing
what lies in plain sight, right before their eyes. Or, per-
haps even more pervasively, they refuse to recognize
the reality because it flies in the face of their deep-

seated beliefs, biases, overconfidence, and uncritical
acceptance of the way that financial markets have
worked, seemingly forever.
(cid:2)
It’s amazing how difficult it is for a man
to understand something if he’s paid
a small fortune not to understand it.
What is more, it is hardly in the interest of our finan-
cial intermediaries to encourage their investor/clients
to recognize the obvious reality. Indeed, the self-interest
of the leaders of our financial system almost compels
them to ignore these relentless rules. Paraphrasing
Upton Sinclair: It’s amazing how difficult it is for a man
to understand something if he’s paid a small fortune notto
understand it.
Our system of financial intermediation has created
enormous fortunes for those in the field of managing
other people’s money. Their self-interest will not soon
change. But as an investor, you must look after your self-
interest. Only by facing the obvious realities of investing
can the intelligent investor succeed.
How much do the costs of financial intermediation
matter? Hugely! In fact, the higher costs of equity funds
have played the determinative role in explaining why fund

managers have lagged the returns of the stock market so
consistently, for so long. When you think about it, how
could it be otherwise? By and large, these managers are
smart, well-educated, experienced, knowledgeable, and
honest. But they are competing with each other. When
one buys a stock, another sells it. There is no net gain to
fund shareholders as a group. In fact, they incur a loss
equal to the transaction costs they pay to those Helpers
that Warren Buffett warned us about in Chapter 1.
Investors pay far too little attention to the costs of in-
vesting. It’s especially easy to underrate their importance
under today’s three conditions: (1) when so many costs
are hidden from view (portfolio transaction costs, the un-
recognized impact of front-end sales changes, taxes in-
curred on realized gains); (2) when stock market returns
have been high (during the 1980s and 1990s, stock re-
turns averaged 17.5 percent per year, and the average
fund provided a nontrivial—but clearly inadequate—re-
turn of 15 percent); and especially (3) when investors
focus on short-term returns, ignoring the truly confisca-
tory impact of cost over an investment lifetime.
Perhaps an example will help. Let’s assume the stock
market generates a total return averaging 8 percent per
year over a half century. Yes, that’s a long time, but an in-
vestment lifetime is now actually even longer—65 or 70
years for an investor who goes to work at age 22, begins

to invest immediately, and works until, say, age 65; and
then continues to invest over an actuarial expectancy of
20 or more years thereafter. Now let’s assume that the
costs of the average mutual fund continue at their present
rate of at least 2.5 percent per year. Result: a net annual
return of just 5.5 percent for the average fund.
(cid:2)
$10,000 grows to $469,000 . . . or $145,400.
Where did that $323,600 go?
Based on these assumptions, let’s look at the returns
earned on $10,000 over 50 years (Exhibit 4.1). The sim-
ple investment in the stock market grows to $469,000, a
remarkable illustration of the magic of compounding re-
turns over an investment lifetime. In the early years, the
line showing the growth at a 5.5 percent annual rate
doesn’t look all that different from the growth in the
stock market itself. But ever so slowly, the lines begin to
diverge, finally at a truly dramatic rate. By the end of the
long period, the value accumulated in the fund totals just
$145,400, an astounding shortfall of $323,600 to the cu-
mulative return earned in the market itself.
In the investment field, time doesn’t heal all wounds.
It makes them worse. Where returns are concerned,
time is your friend. But where costs are concerned, time

is your enemy. This point is powerfully illustrated when
we consider how much of the value of the $10,000 in-
vestment is eroded with each passing year (Exhibit 4.2).
By the end of the first year, only about 2 percent of the
value of your capital has vanished ($10,800 vs. $10,550).
By the 10th year, 21 percent has vanished ($21,600 vs.
$17,100). By the 30th year, 50 percent has vanished
($100,600 vs. $49,800). And by the end of the invest-
ment period, costs have consumed nearly 70 percent of
the potential accumulation available simply by holding
the market portfolio.

The investor, who put up 100 percent of the capital
and assumed 100 percent of the risk, earned only 31 per-
cent of the market return. The system of financial inter-
mediation, which put up zero percent of the capital and
assumed zero percent of the risk, essentially confiscated
70 percent of that return—surely the lion’s share. What
you see here—and please don’t ever forget it!—is that over
the long term, the miracle of compounding returns is
overwhelmed by the tyranny of compounding costs. Add
that mathematical certainty to the relentless rules of hum-
ble arithmetic described earlier.

(cid:2)
The miracle of compounding returns is
overwhelmed by the tyranny of compounding costs.
But enough of theory and hypothetical examples. Let’s
see how this principle works in the real world. During the
quarter century from 1980 to 2005, the return on the stock
market (measured by the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index) aver-
aged 12.5 percent per year. The return on the average mu-
tual fund averaged just 10.0 percent. That 2.5 percent
differential is about what one might have expected, given our
earlier 3 percent rough estimate of fund costs. (Never forget:
Market return, minus cost, equals investor return.) Simply
put, our fund managers, sitting at the top of the investment
food chain, have confiscated an excessive share of the finan-
cial markets’ returns. Fund investors, inevitably at the bot-
tom of the food chain, have been left with too small a share.
Investors need not have incurred that loss. For they
could have easily invested in a simple index fund tracking
the S&P 500. Such a fund actually returned 12.3 percent
per year during that period—the market return of 12.5 per-
cent less costs of just 0.2 percent. That is an annual margin
of superiority of 2.3 percent over the average fund.
On first impression, that annual gap may not look
large. But when compounded over 25 years, it reaches
staggering proportions. A $10,000 initial investment in the

TURNING A WINNER’S GAME INTO A LOSER’S GAME [45]
index fund grew by a remarkable $170,800, compared with
growth of just $98,200 in the average equity mutual fund—
only 57 percent of the total accumulation in the index fund.
But let’s face the facts. Both of these accumulations are
overstated because they are based on 2005 dollars, which
have less than half the spending power they enjoyed in 1980.
During this period, inflation eroded the real buying power of
these returns at an average rate of 3.3 percent per year.
When we turn those nominal dollars—the dollars that we
earn and spend and invest every day—into real dollars that
are adjusted to take inflation into account, the results for
that original $10,000 investment tumble sharply. The cumu-
lative real profit, after compounding, came to just $40,600
for the average actively managed equity fund, compared with
$76,200 for the passively managed index fund (Exhibit4.3).
Now, the average fund produced barely one-half (ac-
tually 53 percent) of the profit earned by the stock market
through the simple index fund—a return that was there
for the taking. (It is in the nature of arithmetic that de-
ducting the same inflation rate from both figures further
increases the comparative advantage of the investment
with the higher return, in this case the index fund.) Yes,
costs matter! Indeed, costs make the difference between
investment success and investment failure.
In short, the humble arithmetic of investing—the logical,
inevitable, and unyielding penalty assessed by investment costs

and rising living costs—has devastated the returns earned by
mutual fund investors. Using Justice Brandeis’s formulation,
our mutual fund managers seem obsessed with the delusion—
and are foisting that delusion on investors—that a nominal
gross return of 12.5 percent per year in the stock market,
minus fund expenses of 2.5 percent, minus inflation of 3.3
percent, still equals a real netreturn of 12.5 percent. Well, to
state the obvious, it doesn’t. You can add and subtract for
yourself. It equals (you guessed it) only 6.7 percent.

Unless the fund industry changes and improves the
net return it delivers to fund shareholders, it will falter
and finally fail, a victim, yes, of the relentless rules of
humble arithmetic. Were he looking over your shoulder
as you read this book, Justice Brandeis surely would be
warning you, “Remember, O reader, that arithmetic is the
first of the sciences and the mother of safety.”
So, sharpen your pencils. Do your own arithmetic.
Realize that you are not consigned to playing the hyperac-
tive management game that is played by the overwhelming
majority of individual investors and mutual fund owners
alike. The index fund is there to guarantee that you will
earn your fair share of whatever returns our businesses
earn and our stock market delivers.
Don’t Take My Word for It
The innate superiority of the index fund has been
endorsed (perhaps grudgingly) by a wide range of
mutual fund industry insiders. When he retired,
here’s what Peter Lynch, the legendary manager
who steered Fidelity Magellan Fund to such great
success during his 1977 to 1990 tenure, had to say
in Barron’s: “The S&P is up 343.8 percent for 10
years. That is a four-bagger. The general equity
funds are up 283 percent. So it’s getting worse, the

deterioration by professionals is getting worse. The
public would be better off in an index fund.”Now hear
industry leader Jon Fossel,former chairman of The
Investment Company Institute and of the Oppen-
heimer Funds in the Wall Street Journal: “People
ought to recognize that the average fund can never
outperform the market in total.” (Italics added.)
Even hyperactive investors seem to believe in in-
dexing strategies. Here’s what James J. Cramer,
money manager and host of CNBC’s Mad Money
says: “After a lifetime of picking stocks, I have to
admit that Bogle’s arguments in favor of the index
fund have me thinking of joining him rather than try-
ing to beat him. Bogle’s wisdom and common sense
[are] indispensable...for anyone trying to figure
out how to invest in this crazy stock market.” And
hedge fund managers, too, join the chorus. One of
money management’s giants, Clifford A. Asness,
managing and founding principal of AQR Capital
Management, adds his own wisdom, expertise, and
integrity: “Market-cap based indexing will never be
driven from its deserved perch as core and deserved
king of the investment world. It is what we should
all own in theory and it has delivered low-cost eq-
uity returns to a great mass of investors...the now
and forever king-of-the-hill.”

I
T IS GRATIFYING THAT industry insiders such as the In-
vestment Company Institute’s (ICI’s) chairman Jon Fossel,
Fidelity’s Peter Lynch, Mad Money’s James Cramer, and
AQR’s Clifford Asness agree with me about the inevitable
inadequacy of returns earned by the typical equity mutual
fund relative to the returns available simply by owning the
stock market through an index fund based on the S&P 500.
But the idea that fund investors themselves actually earn
those returns proves to be a grand illusion. Not only an illu-
sion, but a generous one. The reality is considerably worse.
For in addition to paying the heavy costs that fund managers

extract for their services, the shareholders pay an additional
cost that has been even larger.
During the 25-year period examined in Chapter 4,
the returns we presented were based on the traditional
time-weighted returns reported by the funds—the change
in the asset value of each fund share, adjusted to reflect
the reinvestment of all income dividends and capital gains
distributions. But that fund return does not tell us what
return was earned by the average fund investor. And that
return turns out to be far lower.
(cid:2)
Hint: money flows into most funds after good
performance, and goes out when bad
performance follows.
To ascertain the return earned by the average fund in-
vestor, we must consider the dollar-weighted return,
which accounts for the impact of capital flows from in-
vestors, into and out of the fund.* (Hint: money flows
into most funds after good performance is achieved, and
goes out when bad performance follows.)

turns with the returns actually earned by their investors
*If a $100 million fund earns a return of 30 percent during a given year and
$1 billion of its shares are purchased on the final day of the year, the aver-
age return earned by its investors would be just 4.9 percent.

over the past quarter century, it turns out that the average
fund investor earned, not the 10.0 percent reported by
the average fund, but 7.3 percent—an annual return fully
2.7 percentage points per year less than that of the fund.
(In fairness, the index fund investor, too, was enticed by
the rising market, and earned a return of 10.8 percent,
1.5 percentage points short of the fund return itself.)
Yes, during the past 25 years, while the stock market
index fund was providing an annual return of 12.3 percent
and the average equity fund was earning an annual return
of 10.0 percent, the average fund investor was earning
only 7.3 percent a year.
Compounded over the full period, as we saw in Chapter
4, the 2.5 percent penalty incurred by the average fund be-
cause of costs was huge. But the dual penalties of faulty tim-
ing and adverse selection were even larger. Exhibit5.1 shows
that $10,000 invested in the index fund grew to $170,800; in
the average equity fund, to $98,200—just 57 percent of what
was there for the taking. But the compound return earned by
the average fund investor tumbled to $48,200, a stunning 28
percent of the return on the simple index fund.
And once again, the value of all those dollars tumbles
because we must take inflation into account. The index
fund real return drops to 9.0 percent per year, but the
real return of the average fund investor plummets to just
4.0 percent. On a compounded basis, $76,200 of real

imagine such a staggering gap, but facts are facts.
While the data clearly indicate that fund investor returns
fell well short of fund returns, there is no way to be precise
about the exact shortfall.* But the point of this examination
of the returns earned by the stock market, the average fund,

and the average fund owner is not precision, but direction.
Whatever the precise data, the evidence is compelling that
equity fund returns lag the stock market by a substantial
amount, largely accounted for by their costs, and that fund
investor returns lag fund returns by an even larger amount.
(cid:2)
Inflamed by heady optimism and greed,
and enticed by the wiles of mutual fund marketers,
investors poured their savings into equity funds
at the bull market peak.
What explains this shocking lag? Simply put, counter-
productive market timing and fund selection. First, share-
holders investing in equity funds paid a heavy timing
penalty. They invested too little of their savings in equity
funds during the 1980s and early 1990s when stocks repre-
sented good values. Then, inflamed by the heady optimism
and greed of the era and enticed by the wiles of mutual
fund marketers as the bull market neared its peak, they
poured too much of their savings into equity funds. Sec-
ond, they paid a selection penalty, pouring their money
into the market not only at the wrong time but into the
wrong funds. In both failures, investors simply failed to
practice what common sense would have told them.
This lag effect was amazingly pervasive. In the past
decade, the returns provided to investors by 198 of the

[54] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING
200 most popular equity funds of 1996 to 2000 were
lower than the returns that they reported to investors!
This lag was especially evident during the “new econ-
omy” craze of the late 1990s. Then, the fund industry or-
ganized more and more funds, usually funds that carried
considerably higher risk than the stock market itself, and
magnified the problem by heavily advertising the eye-
catching past returns earned by its hottest funds.
As the market soared, investors poured ever larger
sums of money into equity funds. They invested a net total
of only $18 billion in 1990 when stocks were cheap, but
$420 billion in 1999 and 2000, when stocks were overval-
ued (Exhibit 5.2). What’s more, they also chose over-
whelmingly the highest-risk growth funds, to the virtual
exclusion of more conservative value-oriented funds.
While only 20 percent of their money went into risky ag-
gressive growth funds in 1990, they poured fully 95 per-
cent into such funds when they peaked during 1999 and
early 2000. After the fall, when it was too late, investor
purchases dried up to as little as $50 billion in 2002, when
the market hit bottom. They also pulled their money out
of growth funds and turned, too late, to value funds.
The problems of counterproductive market timing and
unwise fund selection can be illustrated by observing the
experience of the most popular growth funds of five giant
fund families with the largest cash inflows, altogether more

than $150 billion between 1996 and 2000 inclusive (Exhibit
5.3). During those five years, these aggressive funds pro-
vided spectacular records—annual returns averaging 21
percent per year, well above even the outstanding return of
18.4 percent on the S&P 500 Index fund. But during the
five years that followed, in 2001 through 2005, retribution
followed. While the index fund eked out a small gain (less
than 1 percent per year), the returns of these aggressive,
risk-laden funds tumbled into negative territory.
For the full 10 years, taking into account both their
rise and their fall, the returns reported by these aggressive
funds were actually quite acceptable—an average of 7.8

percent per year, nearly equal to the return of 9.1 percent
for the index fund. But woe to the shareholder who chose
them. For while the fund returns were acceptable, the re-
turns of their shareholders were, well, terrible.
Their average return came to minus 0.4 percent per
year, in negative territory and a lag of fully 8.3 percentage
points behind the funds’ reported per share figure. For
the record, the annual return of the index fund share-
holder, at 7.1 percent, also lagged the return of the fund,
but by only 2.0 percentage points, far less than this
group’s gap of 8.3 percentage points, or even the industry
gap of 2.7 percentage points.
When the annual returns of these aggressive funds
are compounded over the full period, the deterioration is
stunning: a cumulative fund return averaging more than
112 percent; a cumulative shareholder return averaging
negative 4.5 percent. That’s a lag of more than 117 per-
centage points! This astonishing penalty, then, makes
clear the perils of fund selection and timing. It also illus-
trates the value of indexing and the necessity of setting a
sound course and then sticking to it, come what may.

[58] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING
The shocking performance of fund investors during
the stock market “new economy” bubble is unusual in its
dimension, but not in its existence. Fund investors have
been chasing past performance since time eternal, allow-
ing their emotions—perhaps even their greed—to over-
whelm their reason. But the fund industry itself has played
on these emotions, bringing out new funds to meet the
fads and fashions of the day, often supercharged and spec-
ulative, and then aggressively advertising and marketing
them. It is fair to say that when ever-counterproductive in-
vestor emotions are played on by ever-counterproductive
fund industry promotions, little good is apt to result.
The fund industry will not soon give up its promo-
tions. But the intelligent investor will be well advised to
heed not only the message in Chapter 4 about minimizing
expenses, but the message in this chapter about getting
emotions out of the equation. The beauty of the index
fund, then, lies not only in its low expenses, but in its
elimination of all those tempting fund choices that prom-
ise so much and deliver so little. Unlike the hot funds of
the day, the index fund can be held through thick and thin
for an investment lifetime, and emotions need never enter
the equation. The winning formula for success in invest-
ing is owning the entire stock market through an index
fund, and then doing nothing. Just stay the course.

THE GRAND ILLUSION [59]
Don’t Take My Word for It
The wise Warren Buffett shares my view, in what I
call his “four E’s.”“The greatest Enemies of the Equity
investor are Expenses and Emotions.” Even Andrew
Lo, MIT professor and author of A Non-Random
Walk Down Wall Street (suggesting strategies to out-
perform the market), personally “invests by buying
and holding index funds.” Perhaps even more surpris-
ingly, the founder and chief executive of the largest
mutual supermarket—while vigorously promoting ac-
tively managed funds—favors the classic index fund
for himself. When asked why people invest in man-
aged funds, Charles Schwab answered: “It’s fun to
play around... it’s human nature to try to select the
right horse... (But) for the average person, I’m more
of an indexer...The predictability is so high...For
10, 15, 20 years you’ll be in the 85th percentile of per-
formance. Why would you screw it up?”
Mark Hulbert, highly regarded editor of the
Hulbert Financial Digest concurs. “Assuming that
the future is like the past, you can outperform 80
percent of your fellow investors over the next several
decades by investing in an index fund—and doing
nothing else. [But] acquire the discipline to do some-
thing even better: become a long-term index fund in-
vestor.” His New York Times article was headlined:
“Buy and Hold? Sure, but Don’t Forget the Hold.”

index fund has provided excellent protection from the

But there is yet another cost—too often ignored—that

receive. I’m referring to taxes—federal, state, and local in-
come taxes.* And here again, the index fund garners a
substantial edge. The fact is that most managed mutual
funds are astonishingly tax-inefficient, a result of the short-
term focus of their portfolio managers, usually frenetic
traders of the stocks in the portfolios they supervise.
(cid:2)
Managed mutual funds are
astonishingly tax-inefficient.
The turnover of the average equity fund now comes
to about 100 percent per year. (In fairness, based on total
assets rather than number of funds, the turnover rate of
actively managed funds is 61 percent.) Industrywide, the
average stock is held by the average fund for an average
of just 12 months. (Based on equity fund total assets, only
20 months.) Hard as it is to imagine, from 1945 to 1965,
the turnover rate averaged just 16 percent per year, an av-
erage holding period of six years for the average stock in
a fund portfolio. This huge increase in turnover and its
attendant transaction costs have ill-served fund investors.
*About one-half of all equity mutual fund shares are held by individual
investors in fully taxable investment accounts. The other half are held in tax-
deferred accounts such as individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and corporate
savings, thrift, and profit-sharing plans. If your fund holdings are solely in the
latter category, you need not be concerned with the discussion in this chapter.

[62] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING
This pattern of tax-inefficiency for active managers
seems destined to continue as long as (1) stocks rise, and
(2) fund managers continue their hyperactive patterns of
short-term trading. Let’s be clear: Most fund managers,
once focused on long-term investment, are now focused
on short-term speculation. But the index fund follows pre-
cisely the opposite policy—buying and holding forever,
and incurring transaction costs that are somewhere be-
tween infinitesimal and zero.
So let’s pick up where we left off two chapters ago,
with the net annual return of 10.0 percent for the average
equity fund over the past 25 years can be compared with
the 12.3 percent return for the S&P 500 Index fund.
With the high portfolio turnover of actively managed
funds, their taxable investors were subject to an estimated
effective annual federal tax of 1.8 percentage points per
year (state and local taxes would further balloon the fig-
ure), reducing the after-tax annual return to 8.2 percent
(Exhibit 6.1).
Despite the higher returns that they earned, in-
vestors in the index fund were actually subjected to
lower taxes—in fact, at 0.6 percentage points, only
about one-third of that tax burden—bringing their
after-tax return to 11.7 percent. Compounded, the ini-
tial $10,000 investment grew by just $61,700 after
taxes for the active funds, nearly 60 percent less than

What’s more, just as fund expenses are paid in cur-
rent dollars, so is your annual tax bill. When we calculate
the accumulated wealth in terms of real dollars with 1980
buying power, investor wealth again contracts dramati-
cally. The annual real return of the average equity fund
now drops to 4.9 percent, less than 60 percent of the 8.4

real after-tax accumulation on that initial $10,000 came to
$65,100 for the index fund, nearly three times the

postbubble era, actively managed funds persist in foisting

I hesitate to assign the responsibility for being “the
straw that broke the camel’s back” of equity fund returns
to any single one of these negative factors. But surely the
final straws include (1) high costs, (2) the adverse investor
selections and counterproductive market timing described
in Chapter 5, and (3) taxes. Whatever way one looks at it,
the camel’s back is surely broken. But the very last straw,
it turns out, is inflation.

costs, taxes, and inflation.

and our taxes on fund capital gains (often realized on a

short-term basis, to boot)—and yet accumulate our assets
only in real dollars, eroded by the relentless rise in the cost
of living that seems imbedded in our economy, the results
are devastating. It is truly remarkable—and hardly praise-
worthy—that this devastation is virtually ignored in the in-
formation that fund managers provide to fund investors.
A paradox: While the index fund is remarkably tax-
efficient in managing capital gains, it turns out to be rela-
tively tax-inefficient in distributing dividend income.
Why? Because its rock-bottom costs mean that nearly all
the dividends paid on the stocks held by the low-cost
index fund actually flow directly into the hands of the
index fund’s shareholders. With the high expense ratios
incurred by managed funds, however, only a tiny portion
of the dividends that the funds receive actually find their
way into the hands of the fund’s shareholders.
Here is the unsurprising and ever relentless arith-
metic: the annual gross dividend yield earned by the typi-
cal active equity fund before deducting fund expenses is
about the same as the dividend yield of the low-cost index
fund—1.8 percent in late-2006. But after deducting the
1.5 percent of expenses borne by the typical active fund,
its net dividend yield drops to just 0.3 percent (!) for its
owners. Fund operating costs and fees confiscate fully 80
percent of its dividend income, a sad reaffirmation of the
eternal position of fund investors at the bottom of the mu-
tual fund food chain.

bogl_c06.qxd 2/8/07 10:23 AM Page 66
[66] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING
The expense ratio of a low-cost index fund is about
0.15 percent, consuming only 8 percent of its 1.8 percent
dividend yield. The result: a net yield of 1.65 percent to
distribute to the passively managed index fund owners, a
dividend merely 5.5 times as high as the dividend yield of
0.3 percent on the actively managed fund.
For taxable shareholders, that larger dividend is subject
to the current 15 percent federal tax on dividend income,
consuming about 0.27 percentage points of the yield. Para-
doxically, the active fund, with an effective tax rate of just
0.045 percent (15 percent of the 0.3 percent net yield), ap-
pears more tax efficient from a dividend standpoint. But the
reality is that the tax imposed by the active managers in the
form of the fees it deducts before paying those dividends has
already consumed 80 percent of the yield. The wise investor
will seek the dividend “tax-inefficiency” of the index fund div-
idend rather than the “tax-efficiency” of most actively man-
aged funds engendered by their confiscatory operating costs.

then of the Federal Reserve System: “Mutual funds have failed
to manage their realized capital gains in such a way as to permit
a substantial deferral of taxes (raising) investors’ tax bills con-
siderably....If the Vanguard 500 Index Fund could have de-
ferred all of its realized capital gains, it would have ended up in
the 91.8 percentile for the high tax investor” (i.e., it outpaced
92 percent of all managed equity funds).
Or listen to investment adviser William Bernstein, au-
thor of The Four Pillars of Investing: “While it is probably a
poor idea to own actively managed mutual funds in general, it is
truly a terrible idea to own them in taxable accounts...(taxes
are) a drag on performance of up to 4 percentage points each
year...many index funds allow your capital gains to grow
largely undisturbed until you sell....For the taxable investor, in-
dexing means never having to say you’re sorry.”
And Dr. Malkielagain casts his lot with the index fund:
“Index funds are...tax friendly, allowing investors to defer
the realization of capital gains or avoid them completely if the
shares are later bequeathed. To the extent that the long-run
uptrend in stock prices continues, switching from security to
security involves realizing capital gains that are subject to tax.
Taxes are a crucially important financial consideration be-
cause the earlier realization of capital gains will substantially
reduce net returns. Index funds do not trade from security to
security and, thus, they tend to avoid capital gains taxes.”

EMEMBER THE UNFAILING principle described in
Chapter 2: in the long run it is the reality of business—the
dividend yields and earnings growth of corporations—that
drives the returns generated by the stock market. How-
ever, I must warn you that during the past 25 years—the
period examined in the three preceding chapters—the
12.5 percent nominal annual return provided by the U.S.
stock market included a speculative return of nearly 3
percent per year, far above the business reality.

WHEN THE GOOD TIMES NO LONGER ROLL [69]
Recall that the century-plus nominal investment re-
turn earned by stocks was 9.5 percent, consisting of an
average dividend yield of 4.5 percent and average annual
earnings growth of 5.0 percent. A mere 0.1 percent per
year—what I described as speculative return—was added
by the rise in the price/earnings ratio from 15 times at the
beginning of the period to 18 times at its end, bringing
the total annual return to 9.6 percent.*
Paradoxically, the investment return earned by stocks
over the past 25 years was hardly extraordinary. A dividend
yield averaging 3.4 percent plus annual earnings growth of
6.4 percent brought it to 9.8 percent, almost precisely
equal to the historical norm of 9.5 percent. But, illustrat-
ing the difficulty of forecasting changes in the amount that
investors are willing to pay for each dollar of corporate
earnings, the speculative return was anything but normal.
(cid:2)
Common sense tells us that we’re facing an era of
subdued returns in the stock market.
As investor confidence rose, so did the price/earnings
(P/E) ratio rise—from 9 times to 18 times, an amazing 100
*A more-than-technical caveat: due to the issuance of additional shares of
stock by corporations over the years, the rate of growth of corporate earn-
ings per share is estimated to lag the growth of aggregate corporate earn-
ings by as much as 2 percentage points per year.

percent increase, adding fully 2.7 percentage points per
year—almost 30 percent—to the solid 9.8 percent funda-
mental return. (Early in 2000, the P/E ratio had actually
risen to an astonishing 32 times, only to plummet to 18
times as the new economy bubble burst.) Result: specula-
tive return was responsible for more than 20 percent of the
market’s 12.5 percent annual return during this period.
Since it is unrealistic to expect the P/E ratio to double in
the coming decade, a similar 12.5 percent return is un-
likely to recur. Common sense tells us that we’re facing an
era of subdued returns in the stock market (Exhibit 7.1).

WHEN THE GOOD TIMES NO LONGER ROLL [71]
Why? First, because today’s dividend yield on stocks
is not 4.5 percent (the historical rate), but slightly below
2 percent. Thus we can expect a dead-weight loss of 2.5
percentage points per year in the contribution of dividend
income to investment return. Let’s assume that corporate
earnings will continue (as, over time, they usually have) to
grow at about the pace of our economy’s expected nomi-
nal growth rate of 5 or 6 percent per year over the com-
ing decade. If that’s correct, then the most likely
investment return on stocks would be in the range of 7 to
8 percent. I’ll be optimistic and project an annual invest-
ment return (a bit nervously!) averaging 8 percent.
Second, the present price/earnings multiple on
stocks looks to be about 18 times based on the trailing
12-month reported earnings of the S&P 500 (16 times
if we use projected operating earnings, which exclude
write-offs for discontinued business activities). If it re-
mains at that level a decade hence, speculative return
would neither add to nor detract from that possible 8
percent investment return. My guess (it is little more
than that) is that the P/E might ease down to, say, 16
times, reducing the market’s return by about 1 percent-
age point a year, to an annual rate of 7 percent. You
don’t have to agree with me. If you think it will leap to
25 times, add 3 percentage points, bringing the total re-
turn on stocks to 11 percent. If you think it will drop to

[72] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING
12 times, subtract 4 percentage points; reducing the
total return on stocks to 4 percent.
(cid:2)
If rational expectations suggest future annual
returns of about 7 percent on stocks, what does
this imply for returns on equity funds?
Now assume that 7 percent is a rational expectation for
future stock market returns. To calculate the return for the
average actively managed equity mutual fund in such an en-
vironment, simply remember the humble arithmetic of fund
investing: nominal market return, minus investment costs,
minus taxes (reduced to reflect lower capital gains realiza-
tion), minus an assumed inflation rate of 2.3 percent (the
rate the financial markets are now expecting over the com-
ing decade) equals just 1.4 percent per year (Exhibit 7.2). I
simply didn’t have the courage to make another deduction
to reflect the impact of the counterproductive timing and
adverse fund selection that will likely continue to bedevil the
typical fund shareholder. It may seem absurd to project
such a low return for the typical equity fund investor. But
the numbers are there. Again, feel free to disagree and to
project the future using your own rational expectations.
In summary, the future outlook for stock returns is
far below the long-term real return on U.S. stocks of

about 6.5 percent annually. My projection of a future
real return of 4.7 percent (before costs and taxes) is con-
servative largely because today’s dividend yield of 2 per-
cent is below the long-term norm of 4.5 percent,
partially offset by my optimistic projection of real earn-
ings growth of 2.5 percent per year versus the 1.5 per-
cent long-term norm. The real long-term rate of per
share earnings growth of U.S. corporations has been no
more than that humble figure. As suggested earlier,
some experts put the figure at only 1 percent on an earn-
ings per share basis.

[74] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING
In any event, in a likely future environment of lower
returns on equities, the low-cost, tax-efficient index fund
would provide even higher real returns relative to actively
managed equity funds than the enormous advantage it has
achieved over the past quarter century. Yes, a real 10-year
gain of $5,100 on a $10,000 investment in the index fund
is nothing to write home about. But what’s to be said
about the mere $1,500 profit that could well be what the
typical managed equity fund delivers?
(cid:2)
Unless the fund industry begins to change, the
typical actively managed fund appears to be a
singularly unfortunate investment choice.
The fact is that lower returns harshly magnify the
relentless arithmetic of excessive mutual fund costs,
even ignoring all those unnecessary taxes. Why? While
costs of 2.5 percentage points would consume “only”
16 percent of a 15 percent return and “only” 25 per-
cent of a 10 percent return, such costs would consume
nearly 40 percent of a 7 percent nominal return and (I
hope you’re sitting down) nearly 60 percent of the 4.5
real return on stocks that rational expectations sug-
gest. Unless the fund industry begins to change—by
reducing management fees, operating expenses, sales

charges, and portfolio turnover, with its attendant
costs—the typical actively managed fund appears to be
a singularly unfortunate choice for investors.
The 1.2 percent expected annual real return that the
average equity fund might deliver is unacceptable. What
can equity fund investors do to avoid being trapped by these
relentless rules of arithmetic, so devastating when applied
to future returns that are likely to be well below long-term
norms? There are at least five options for improving on it:
(1) Select winning funds on the basis of their long-term past
records. (2) Select winning funds on the basis of their re-
cent short-term performance. (3) Get some professional ad-
vice in selecting funds that are likely to outpace the market.
(4) Select funds with rock-bottom costs, minimal portfolio
turnover, and no sales loads. Or (5) Select a low-cost index
fund that simply holds the stock market portfolio.
In Chapters 8 through 12, we’ll examine each of these
options.
Don’t Take My Word for It
Financial advisers seem to agree with my appraisal of
future returns. In the latter part of 2006, in a speech
before these professionals at their Chicago conven-
tion, I polled the audience. The clear consensus:
stock returns of 6.5 percent over the coming decade.

bogl_c07.qxd 2/8/07 10:24 AM Page 76
[76] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING
Investment bankers are of a similar mind. When
Henry McVey, market strategist for Morgan Stan-
ley, polled the chief financial officers of the 100
largest corporations in the United States, they ex-
pected a future return on stocks of 6.6 percent. (One
wonders how these executives can justify their implicit
assumption that the stocks in their companies’ pen-
sion plans will return 11 percent per year.)
Other highly regarded investment strategists also
share my general view that we are facing a new era of
subdued investment returns. Gary P. Brinson, CFA,
former president of UBS Investment Management, is
one whose assessment about future returns echoes my
own. “Today’s investment market fundamentals and fi-
nancial variables clearly suggest that future real returns
from a mixed portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other as-
sets (such as real estate) are unlikely to be greater than
4.5 to 5.0 percent. With an inflation assumption of
2.5 percent, nominal returns greater than 7.0 to 7.5
percent for these portfolios are unrealistic. What can-
not be explained is why people are willing to pay the
considerable fees (involved). Perhaps they are paying
for historical returns, for hope, or out of desperation...
“For the markets in total, the amount of value
added, or alpha, must sum to zero. One person’s
positive alpha is someone else’s negative alpha.
Collectively, for the institutional, mutual fund,
and private banking arenas, the aggregate alpha re-

turn will be zero or negative after transaction
costs. Aggregate fees for the active managers
should thus be, at most, the fees associated with-
passive management. Yet, these fees are several
times larger than fees that would be associated
with passive management. This illogical conun-
drum will ultimately have to end.”
Or consider these words by Richard M. Ennis,
CFA, Ennis Knupp+Associates, and editor of the
Financial Analysts Journal: “Today, with interest
rates near 4 percent and stocks yielding less than
2 percent, few among us expect double-digit invest-
ment returns for any extended period in the near
future. Yet, we live with a legacy of that era: histori-
cally high fee structures brought on by trillions
upon trillions of dollars seeking growth during the
boom and shelter in its aftermath. Second, facing
the dual challenge of market efficiency and high
costs, investors will continue to shift assets from
active to passive management. And third, some of
active management’s true believers will shift assets
from expensive products to more reasonably priced
products. Impetus for this move will be the growing
realization that high fees sap the performance poten-
tial of even skillful managers.”

ELECTING WINNING FUNDS in advance is more diffi-
cult than it looks. Sure, there are always some winners
that survive over the years. And if we pore over records
of past performance, it is easy to find them. The mutual
funds we hear the most about are those that have lit up
the skies with their glow of past success. We don’t hear
much about those that did well for a while—even for a
long while—and then faltered. And when they falter, they
often go out of business, consigned to the dustbin of mu-
tual fund history. But easy as it is to identify past winners,

there is little evidence that such performance persists in
the future.
Let’s begin by considering the records of funds that have
won over the long term. Exhibit 8.1 goes back to 1970 and
shows the 36-year records of the 355 equity funds that ex-
isted at the start of that period. The first and most obvious
surprise awaits you: fully 223 of those funds—almost two-
thirds—have gone out of business. If your fund doesn’t last
for the long term, how can you invest for the long term?
You can safely assume it was not the best performers
that have gone to their well-earned demise; it was the lag-
gards that disappeared. Sometimes their managers

moved on. (The average fund portfolio manager, in fact,
lasts just five years.) Sometimes giant financial conglom-
erates acquired their management companies, and the
new owners decided to “clean up the product line.”
(These conglomerates, truth told, are in business pri-
marily to earn a return on their capital, not on the fund
investor’s capital.) Funds with lagging performance saw
their investors flee, and they became a drag on their
managers’ profits. There are many reasons that funds
disappear, few of them good.
(cid:2)
A death in the family.
Even funds with solid long-term records go out of
business. Often, their management companies are ac-
quired by marketing companies whose ambitious execu-
tives conclude that, however good the funds’ early records,
they are not exciting enough to draw huge amounts of cap-
ital from new investors. The funds have simply outlived
their usefulness. In other cases, a few years of faltering
performance does the job. Sadly, the second oldest fund in
the entire mutual fund industry was a recent victim of
these attitudes, put out of business by a new owner of its
management company. After surviving all the tempestuous
markets of the past 80 years: State Street Investment
Trust, 1925–2005, R.I.P. As one of the longest-serving

participants in the fund industry, who clearly remembers
the classy record of this fund over so many years, I regard
the loss of State Street as a death in the family.
In any event, 223 of the equity funds of 1970 are
gone, mostly the poor performers. Another 60 remain,
yet significantly underperformed the S&P 500 by more
than 1 percentage point per year. Together, then, 283
funds—nearly 80 percent of the funds among those origi-
nal 355—have, one way or another, failed to distinguish
themselves. Another 48 funds provided returns within
one percentage point, plus or minus, of the return of the
S&P 500—market-matchers, as it were.
That leaves just 24 mutual funds—only one out of
every 14—that outpaced the market by more than one
percentage point per year. Let’s face it: those are terrible
odds! What’s more, the margin of superiority of 15 of
those 24 funds over the S&P 500 was less than 2 percent-
age points per year, a superiority that may be due as much
to luck as to skill.
That still leaves us with nine solid long-term winners.
It is a tremendous accomplishment to outpace the market
by 2 percentage points or more of annual return over 35
years. Make no mistake about that. But, here a curious—
perhaps almost obvious—fact emerges (Exhibit 8.2). Six
of those nine winners achieved their superiority many
years ago, often when they were of small size.

When the accomplishments of these nine successful
mutual funds were noticed by investors, cash poured in,
and they got large. But, as Warren Buffett reminds us, “a
fat wallet is the enemy of superior returns.” And so it was.
As they grew, the records of six of them turned lackluster.
One fund reached its performance peak way back in 1982,
24 long years ago. On balance, it has lagged ever since.
Two others peaked in 1983. The remaining three peaked
no more recently than 1993, more than a decade ago.
(One of these was Peter Lynch’s legendary Fidelity Magel-
lan Fund, which has now been struggling for 13 years.)
That leaves just three funds. Only three out of the
355 equity funds that started the race in 1970—only 8⁄ of

Only three out of the 355 equity funds that
started the race in 1970—8⁄ of 1 percent—

have survived and mounted a record
of sustained excellence.
Significantly, while the portfolio managers for these
three funds have changed over the years, the changes have
been infrequent. Succeeding his father Shelby C. Davis,
Chris Davis has managed the Davis Fund since 1991
(since 1996, with Kenneth Feinberg). Will Danoff has
been the lead manager of Fidelity Contrafund since 1990,
and Michael Price managed Franklin until 1997, followed
by a successor who ran the fund until 2005.
But before you rush out to invest in these three funds
with such truly remarkable long-term records, think about
the next35 years. Think about the odds that they will con-
tinue to outperform. Think about their present size.
Think about the fact that within that time frame they are
all virtually certain to have at least several new managers.
Think, too, about the odds that these funds will even exist

35 years hence. It is a changing and competitive world out
there in mutual fund land, and no one knows what the fu-
ture holds. But I wish these managers and the sharehold-
ers of the funds they run the very best of luck.
(cid:2)
Before you rush out to invest in these three funds
with such truly remarkable long-term records,
think about the next 35 years.
Conspicuous by its absence from this list of winning
funds is Legg Mason Value Trust, managed since its 1982
inception by legendary investment professional supreme,
Bill Miller. Since the fund did not begin operations until
1982, it is not on my list. But it provides several lessons
about fund performance. Miller, something of a contrar-
ian, is the only manager in the past four decades to out-
perform the S&P 500 for a truly remarkable 15
consecutive years (1991 to 2005, inclusive). Despite his
great ability, the ever-humble Miller would be, I think, the
first to agree with the late Harvard University paleontolo-
gist Stephen Jay Gould’s tenet that “long streaks are ex-
traordinary luck imposed on great skill.”
Just like Joe DiMaggio’s remarkable 56-game hitting
streak in baseball, the longer Miller’s streak extended,
the more attention it got, and the more investor dollars
flowed into the fund. But in 2006, his streak came to an

==================================================

SELECTING LONG-TERM WINNERS [85]
end, even as did the streak of the Yankee Clipper years
earlier. With the S&P 500 up 15.8 percent in 2006, Legg
Mason Value was up only 5.8 percent, trailing the index
by 10.0 percentage points, putting something of a dent in
the long-term record.
Through 2005, the fund’s annual rate of return had
averaged 15.3 percent per year, compared with 12.9 per-
cent for the S&P 500, a nice annual edge of 2.4 percent-
age points. But by 2006, the gap had shrunk to 1.9
percentage points, with an annual time-weighted return
averaging 14.9 percent, compared with 13.0 percent for
the index. Unsurprisingly, the major inflows of investor
capital did not begin until 1997, the seventh year of the
streak. So the actual return earned by Legg Mason
Value’s shareholders was a sharply lower 10.3 percent, far
below its reported return. Is Miller’s reversion toward and
then below the market mean temporary or enduring? Will
the fund be afflicted with the same malaise that attacked
six of those nine long-term winners just discussed? Or is it
merely a brief interval of bad luck. Who can know?
Whatever the case, the odds in favor of owning a con-
sistently successful equity fund are less than one out of a
hundred. However one slices and dices the data, there can
be no question that funds with long-serving portfolio man-
agers and records of consistent excellence are the excep-
tion rather than the rule in the mutual fund industry. The

[86] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING
simple fact is that selecting a mutual fund that will outpace
the stock market over the long term is, using Cervantes’
wonderful observation, like “looking for a needle in the
haystack.” So I offer you Bogle’s corollary: “Don’t look
for the needle in the haystack. Just buy the haystack!”
(cid:2)
Funds with long-serving portfolio managers and
records of consistent excellence are the exception
rather than the rule in the mutual fund industry.
The haystack, of course, is the entire stock market
portfolio, readily available through a low-cost index fund.
The return of such a fund would have roughly matched or
exceeded the returns of 346 of the 355 funds that began the
35-year competition described earlier in this chapter. And I
see no reason that the same fund cannot achieve a roughly
commensurate achievement in the years to come—not
through any legerdemain, but merely through the relentless
rules of arithmetic that you now must know so well.
We know that the index fund will deliver substantially
all of the stock market’s return. But with all the fund man-
ager changes that will inevitably be forthcoming for ac-
tively managed funds; with all the funds that will die; with
the successful funds drawing capital in amounts that will
preclude their future success; and with our inability to be

and how much on skill, there is simply no way to assure
success by picking the funds that will beat the market,
even by looking to their past performance over the long
term. In fund performance, the past is rarely prologue.
Don’t Take My Word for It
Need more advice? With his customary wisdom,
Paul Samuelsonsums up the difficulty of selecting
superior managers in this parable. “Suppose it was
demonstrated that one out of twenty alcoholics
could learn to become a moderate social drinker.
The experienced clinician would answer, ‘Even if
true, act as if it were false, for you will never identify
that one in twenty, and in the attempt five in twenty
will be ruined.’ Investors should forsake the search for
such tiny needles in huge haystacks.”
In the Wall Street Journal, long-time “Getting
Going” columnist Jonathan Clements asks, “Can
you pick the winners?” The answer: “Even fans of
actively managed funds often concede that most
other investors would be better off in index funds.
But buoyed by abundant self-confidence, these
folks aren’t about to give up on actively managed
funds themselves. A tad delusional? I think so.
Picking the best-performing funds is ‘like trying to
predict the dice before you roll them down the craps

table,’ says an investment adviser in Boca Raton,
FL. ‘I can’t do it. The public can’t do it.’
“Still, I figure we shouldn’t discourage fans of
actively managed funds. With all their buying and
selling, active investors ensure the market is reason-
ably efficient. That makes it possible for the rest of
us to do the sensible thing, which is to index. Want
to join me in this parasitic behavior? To build a
well-diversified portfolio, you might stash 70 per-
cent of your stock portfolio into a (Dow Jones)
Wilshire 5000-index fund and the remaining 30
percent in an international-index fund.”
If these comments don’t persuade you about the
hazards of focusing on past returns of mutual funds,
just believe what fund organizations tell you. Every
single firm in the fund industry acknowledges my
conclusion that past fund performance is of no help
in projecting the future returns of mutual funds. In
every mutual fund prospectus, in every sales promo-
tional folder, and in every mutual fund advertise-
ment (albeit in print almost too small to read), the
following warning appears: “Past performance is no
guarantee of future results.” Believe it!

N SELECTING MUTUAL FUNDS, most fund investors seem
to rely, not on sustained performance over the long term, but
on exciting performance over the short term. (Exhibits 5.2
and 5.3 in Chapter 5 reinforce this point.) Studies show that
95 percent of all investor dollars flow to funds rated four or
five stars by Morningstar, the statistical service most broadly
used by investors in evaluating fund returns.
These “star ratings” are based on a composite of a
fund’s record over the previous 3-, 5-, and 10-year peri-
ods. (For younger funds, the ratings may cover as few as

three years.) As a result, the previous two years’ perfor-
mance alone accounts for 35 percent of the rating of a
fund with 10 years of history and 66 percent for a fund in
business from three to five years, a heavy bias in favor of
recent short-term returns.
How successful are fund choices based on the num-
ber of stars awarded for such short-term achievements?
Not very! According to investment analyst Mark Hul-
bert, a mutual fund portfolio continuously adjusted to
hold only Morningstar’s five-star funds earned an annual
return of just 6.9 percent between 1994 and 2004, nearly
40 percent below the 11.0 percent return on the Total
Stock Market Index.* To make matters worse, according
to Hulbert, these highly rated funds were assuming even
more risk than the market (average monthly volatility in
asset value: 16 percent for the funds compared with 15
percent for the stock market).
Sadly, the orientation of fund investors toward recent
short-term returns works worst in strong bull markets.

“The first shall be last.” And they were.
Well, you can guess what came next. The bubble burst,
and, one by one, just as the Good Book warns, “The first
shall be last.” Over the next three years (2000 to 2002 inclu-
sive), every one of the original top 10 funds plummeted into
the bottom 60, with not a single fund in the original top 10

ranked higher than 790. Fund 9 on the upside actually was
last—851 on the downside. Fund 1 dropped in rank to 841;
fund 2 dropped to 832, and fund 3 tumbled to 845. On aver-
age, the one-time 10 top funds in the bull market were out-
performed by 95 percent of their peers in the bear market
that followed. For investors who believed that the past would
be prologue, it was not a pretty result.
Please remember that even a single annual gain of 55
percent followed by a loss of 34 percent doesn’t leave the
investor with a 21 percent gain. More like 2 percent. (Do
the arithmetic.) And with 3 years of average annual gains
of55percentontheupsideandannuallossesaveraging34
percent on the downside (Exhibit 9.2), it was much worse.
These aggressive new-economy funds ended up with a cu-
mulativepositivereturnaveraging13percentforthefull6-
year period, a far cry from the S&P 500’s cumulative gain
of 30 percent. Yet while that return was not particularly
satisfactory in terms of the traditional returns reported by
the average equity fund, it was hardly a disaster.
But for the shareholders of the funds, it was a disas-
ter. By investing after seeing those mouth-watering cumu-
lative returns that had averaged almost 280 percent,
achieved in a soaring bull market, nearly all the buyers of
these funds had missed the upside. Then, not a moment
too soon, they caught the full force of the downside.
Their funds tumbled by an astonishing average of 70 per-

themselves achieved a net gain of 13 percent, the in-
vestors in these funds incurred a lossof 57 percent. By in-
vesting in these once high-flying funds, more than half of
the capital that investors had placed in these hot funds
had gone up in smoke. The message is clear: avoid per-
formance chasing based on short-term returns, especially
during great bull markets.

of 681 funds, outpacing 58 percent of their peers, or barely
above average. During that period, the highest achievement
on the 20-fund list was turned in by the number one funds,
which averaged a rank of 100 in the subsequent year.
The clear reversion to the mean suggested by that
single test represented powerful evidence that winning
performance by a mutual fund is unlikely to be repeated.
But there was no reason (except common sense) to as-
sume that the 1982 to 1992 experience would recur. So,
just for fun, I repeated the test in 2006, beginning with
the top-performing 20 funds in 1995 and the top 20 funds
in each of the nine subsequent years. I then checked the
rank of each fund in the following year, just as before.
In general, the results were remarkably similar. The
average subsequent rank of the top 20 funds from 1995
through 2005 was 619, outpacing 57 percent of their
peers and barely above the average fund among the 1,440
fundtotal—justasinthepriortest.Inaninterestingrever-
sal of fortune, however, the number one funds of that era
turned out to have, not the highest subsequent ranking,
but the lowest ranking among the top 20. These champi-
ons subsequently earned an average ranking of 949
among the 1,440-fund total, outpacing only 34 percent of
their peers. While “the first can be first” sometimes, the
first can be last at other times, a wonderful illustration of
the inevitable randomness of fund performance.

The stars produced in the mutual fund field are
rarely stars; all too often they are comets.
The message is clear: reversion to the mean (RTM)—in
this case, the tendency of funds whose records substantially
exceed industry norms to return to average or below—is
alive and well in the mutual fund industry. In stock market
blow-offs, “the first shall be last.” But in more typical envi-
ronments, reversion to the fund mean—which, as we have
seen in earlier chapters, substantially lags the return earned
by a stock market index fund—is the rule. So please remem-
ber that the stars produced in the mutual fund field are
rarely stars; all too often they are comets, lighting up the
firmament for a brief moment in time and then flaming out,
their ashes floating gently to earth.
With each passing year, the reality is increasingly
clear. Fund returns seem to be random. Yes, there are
rare cases where skill seems to be involved, but it would
require decades to determine how much of a fund’s suc-
cess can be attributed to luck, and how much attributed
to skill. And by then, you might ask yourself questions
like these: (1) How long will that manager, with that staff
and with that strategy, remain on the job? (2) If the fund’s
assets are many times larger at the end of the period than
at the beginning, will the same results that were attractive

in the first place be sustained? (3) Will the stock market
continue to favor the same kinds of stocks that have been
at the heart of the manager’s style? In short, selecting
mutual funds on the basis of short-term performance is all
too likely to be hazardous duty, and it is almost always
destined to produce returns that fall far short of those
achieved by the stock market, itself so easily achievable
through an index fund.
Don’t Take My Word for It
Listen to Nassim Nicholas Taleb,author of Fooled
by Randomness: “Toss a coin; headsand the manager
will make $10,000 over the year, tails and he will
lose $10,000. We run [the contest] for the first year
[for 10,000 managers]. At the end of the year, we ex-
pect 5,000 managers to be up $10,000 each, and
5,000 to be down $10,000. Now we run the game a
second year. Again, we can expect 2,500 managers
to be up two years in a row; another year, 1,250; a
fourth one, 625; a fifth, 313. We have now, simply
in a fair game, 313 managers who made money for
five years in a row. [And in 10 years, just 10 of the
original 10,000 managers.] Out of pure luck....
A population entirely composed of bad managers
will produce a small amount of great track

records....The number of managers with great
track records in a given market depends far more on
the number of people who started in the investment
business (in place of going to dental school), rather
than on their ability to produce profits.”
That may sound theoretical, so here is a practical
outlook. Hear Moneymagazine’s colloquy with Ted
Aronson,partner of respected Philadelphia money
management firm Aronson+Johnson+Ortiz:
Q. You’ve said that investing in an actively man-
aged fund (as opposed to a passively run index
fund) is an act of faith. What do you mean?
A. Under normal circumstances, it takes between
20 and 800 years [of monitoring performance] to
statistically prove that a money manager is skillful,
not lucky. To be 95 percent certain that a manager is
not just lucky, it can easily take nearly a millen-
nium—which is a lot more than most people have in
mind when they say “long-term.” Even to be only
75 percent sure he’s skillful, you’d generally have to
track a manager’s performance for between 16 and
115 years....Investors need to know how the
money management business really works. It’s a
stacked deck. The game is unfair.

Q. Where do you invest?
A. In Vanguard index funds. I’ve owned Vanguard
Index 500 for 23 years. Once you throw in taxes, it
just skewers the argument for active management.
Personally, I think indexing wins hands-down. After
tax, active management just can’t win.”
Finally, Money magazine columnist and author
Jason Zweig sums up performance chasing in a sin-
gle pungent sentence: “Buying funds based purely
on their past performance is one of the stupidest
things an investor can do.”

Seeking Advice to

HE EVIDENCE PRESENTED in Chapters 8 and 9 teaches
two lessons: (1) Selecting winning equity funds over the
long term bears all the potential success of looking for
the needle in the haystack; and (2) Selecting winning
funds based on their performance over relatively short-
term periods in the past is all too likely to lead, if not to
disaster, at least to disappointment.
So why not abandon these “do-it-yourself” ap-
proaches, and rely on professional advice? Pick a financial

consultant (the designation usually given to the stockbro-
kers of Wall Street, and indeed brokers everywhere) or an
investment adviser (the designation usually applied to non-
brokers, who often—but not always—work on a “fee only,”
rather than a commission, basis).
I’ll attempt to answer that question in this chapter.
But first, I want to note that I’m focusing only on the
ability of advisers to help you select equity funds that can
produce superior returns for your portfolio. Professional
investment advisers provide many other services including
asset allocation, information on tax considerations, and
advice on how to save while you work and on how to
spend when you retire; and they are always there to con-
sult with you about the financial markets.
Advisers can encourage you to prepare for the fu-
ture and can help you deal with many extra-investment
decisions that have investment implications (for exam-
ple, when you want to build a fund for your children’s
college education or need to raise cash for the pur-
chase of a home). Experienced advisers can also help
you avoid the potholes along the investment highway.
(Put more grossly, they may help you avoid making
such dumb mistakes as chasing past performance or
trying to time the market.) At their best, these impor-
tant services can enhance the implementation of your
investment program.

[102] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING
The overwhelming majority of investors rely on brokers
or advisers for help in penetrating the dense fog of com-
plexity that, for better or worse, permeates our financial
system. If the generally accepted estimate that some 70 per-
cent of the 55 million American families who invest in mu-
tual funds do so through intermediaries is correct, then
only about 15 million families choose the “do-it-yourself”
road. The remaining 40 million families rely on profes-
sional helpers. (That’s the unsuccessful strategy described
in my opening parable about the Gotrocks family.)
We’ll never know exactly how much value is added—
or subtracted—by these helpers. But it’s hard for me to
imagine that as a group they are other than, well, average.
That is, their advice on equity fund selection produces re-
turns for their clients that are probably not measurably
different from those of the average fund, some 2.5 per-
centage points per year behind the stock market, as mea-
sured by the S&P 500 Index (see Chapter 4).
I’m willing to consider the possibility that the fund se-
lections recommended by advisers may be better than av-
erage. As I’ll explain in Chapter 11, if they merely select
funds with the lowest all-in costs—hardly rocket science—
they’ll do better for you. If they’re savvy enough to realize
that high-turnover funds are highly tax-inefficient, they’ll
pick up important additional savings for you in transaction
costs and taxes. If they put those two strategies together

==================================================

SEEKING ADVICE TO SELECT FUNDS? [103]
and emphasize low-cost index funds—as so many advisers
do—so much the better for their clients.
And if professional investment consultants are wise
enough—or lucky enough—to keep their clients from jump-
ing on the latest and hottest bandwagon (for example, the
new economy craze of the late 1990s, reflected in the
mania for funds investing in technology, telecommunica-
tions, and Internet stocks), their clients could earn returns
that easily surpass the disappointing returns achieved by
fund investors as a group. Remember the additional short-
fall of 2.7 percentage points per year relative to the aver-
age equity fund that was estimated in Chapter 5? To
remind you, the nominal return of fund investors came to
just 7.3 percent per year during 1980 to 2005, despite a
wonderful stock market in which a simple S&P 500 Index
Fund earned a return of 12.3 percent.
Alas (from the standpoint of the advisers), there is sim-
ply no evidence that the fund selection advice they provide
has produced any better returns than those achieved by
fund investors on average. In fact, the evidence goes the
other way. A recent study by a research team led by two
Harvard Business School professors concluded that, dur-
ing between 1996 and 2002 alone, “the underperformance
of broker-channel funds (adviser-sold) relative to funds
sold through the direct channel (purchased directly by in-
vestors) cost investors approximately $9 billion per year.”

[104] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING
(cid:2)
Average return of funds recommended
by advisors: 2.9 percent per year.
For equity funds purchased directly: 6.6 percent.
Specifically, the study found that adviser asset alloca-
tions were no better, that they chased market trends, and
that those they advised paid higher upfront charges. The
study’s conclusion: the weighted average return of equity
funds held by investors who relied on advisers (excluding
all charges paid up front or at the time of redemption)—
averaged just 2.9 percent per year—compared with 6.6
percent earned by investors who took charge of their
own affairs.
This powerful evidence, however, does not bring the
researchers to the clear conclusion that advice in its totality
has negative value: “We remain,” the report states, “open
to the possibility that substantial intangible benefits exist,
and will undertake more research to identify these intangi-
ble benefits and explore the elite group of advisers who do
improve the welfare of households who trust them.”
There is other powerful evidence that the use of
stockbrokers (as distinct from financial advisers) has a
strong negative impact on the returns earned by fund in-
vestors. In a study prepared for Fidelity Investments cov-
ering the 10-year period 1994 to 2003 inclusive,

broker-managed funds had the lowest ratings relative to
their peers of any group of funds. (The other groups in-
cluded funds operated by privately owned managers, by
publicly-owned managers, by managers owned by finan-
cial conglomerates, and by bank managers.)
The Merrill Lynch funds were 18 percentage points
below the fund industry average; the Goldman Sachs and
Morgan Stanley funds were 9 percentage points below av-
erage; and both the Wells Fargo and Smith Barney funds
were 8 percentage points behind. Part of the reason for
this disturbing performance may arise from the nature of
the job. The brokerage firm and its brokers/financial con-
sultants must sell something every single day. When the
firm introduces a new fund, the brokers have to sell it to
someone. (Imagine a day when nobody sold anything, and
the stock market lay fallow, silent all day long.)
A Merrill Lynch example illustrates the destructive
challenges that are often faced by investors who rely on
stockbrokers. In March 2000, just as the bubble created by
the Internet stock craze reached at its peak, Merrill Lynch,
the world’s largest stock brokerage firm, jumped on the
bandwagon with two new funds to sell. Both were “new
economy” funds. One was a “Focus Twenty” fund (based on
the then-popular theory that if a manager’s 100 favorite
stocks were good, surely his 20 favorites would be even bet-
ter). The other was an “Internet Strategies” fund. The

==================================================

bogl_c10.qxd 2/8/07 10:25 AM Page 106
[106] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING
public offering of the two funds was an incredible success.
Merrill’s brokers pulled in $2.0 billion from their trusting
(or was it performance chasing?) clients, $0.9 billion in
Focus Twenty and $1.1 billion in Internet Strategies.
The subsequent returns of the funds, however, were
an incredible failure. (Not surprising: the best time to sell
a new fund to investors—when it’s hot—is often the worst
time to buy it.) Internet Strategies tanked almost immedi-
ately. Its asset value dropped 61 percent during the re-
mainder of 2000 and another 62 percent by October
2001. The total loss was a cool 86 percent as most of its
investors cashed out their shares at staggering losses.
When the fund’s original $1.1 billion of assets had plum-
meted to just $128 million, Merrill decided to kill Inter-
net Strategies and give it a decent burial, merging it with
another Merrill fund. (Keeping a record like that alive
would have been a continuing embarrassment to the firm.)
(cid:2)
Two new Merrill Lynch funds: a marketing
success for the firm; an utter failure for its clients.
For what it is worth, the losses in Focus Twenty were
less severe. Its asset value declined 28 percent in the remain-
der of 2000, another 70 percent in 2001, and another 39
percent in 2002, before finally posting positive returns in the
three years that followed. On balance, its cumulative lifetime

return through late 2006 came to minus 79 percent.
Investors have regularly withdrawn their capital, and the
fund’s assets, which would reach almost $1.5 billion in 2000,
currently languish at $82 million, a 95 percent decline. But,
unlike its Internet Strategies cousin, Focus Twenty soldiers
on. The lesson remains: The $2 billion marketing success of
the Merrill Lynch Internet Strategies fund and Focus Twenty
fund was an utter failure for their clients, who lost some 80
percent of their hard-earned savings.
(cid:2)
The New York Timescontest: Funds chosen by
advisers earned 40 percent less than an index fund.
A more extensive test of the ability of financial advis-
ers to outpace the S&P 500 Index was initiated by the
New York Times in July 1993. The editors asked five re-
spected advisers (none were brokers) how they would in-
vest $50,000 in a tax-free retirement account holding
mutual fund shares for an investor who had a time horizon
of at least 20 years. The comparative standard would be
the returns earned by Vanguard 500 Index Fund.
Each quarter, the Times faithfully published the
records of the index fund and the advisers, tracking their
initial portfolios and the subsequent changes they made.
By 2000, seven years later, the Times reported their ac-
complishments (Exhibit 10.1). The hypothetical $50,000

profit was $105,100; the lowest, $61,800.)
While the editors properly acknowledged that not
one of these advisers was able to outpace the result of the
Vanguard 500 Index Fund, they failed to report its final
profit based on that initial investment of $50,000. The
answer (which I provided to the paper in a subsequent let-
ter to the editor) was $138,750. That is, the average ad-
viser produced a paper profit on his portfolio of
recommended funds that was about 40 percent less than
the profit on the index fund.
In mid-2000, the Times abruptly terminated the con-

stated intention was to make a 20-year evaluation.* But I
can guess either that the advisers were too embarrassed to
continue to participate in the contest, or that, as the differ-
ential in favor of the passively managed index fund grew,
quarter after quarter, the contest became sort of non-
newsworthy—even boring. I also have no idea why the New
York Times determined that the remarkable differential in
favor of the index fund was not“news that’s fit to print.”
I endorse the idea that for many—indeed, most—in-
vestors, financial advisers may provide a valuable service
in giving you peace of mind, in helping you establish a
sensible fund portfolio that matches your appetite for re-
ward and your tolerance for risk, and in helping you stay
the course in troubled waters. But the evidence I’ve pre-
sented so far strongly confirms my original hypothesis
*We’ll never know what would have happened had the contest continued.
But the fact is that the Timesterminated it at the very peak of the bull mar-
ket, and at the moment of triumph for the index fund. Since then, the index
fund, like the market itself, has barely held its own. While we don’t know
whether the advisers would have changed their portfolios, we can calculate
how those funds they held in 2000 have since performed. Two advisers did
considerably better than the index fund during that subsequent period; one
was worse, and one about the same. (The results of the fifth adviser can’t
be measured, because two of the funds in his portfolio went out of business.)
Despite this all-too-typical reversion to the mean, the index fund maintained
its superiority for the full period, with a final profit of $131,800 compared
with $117,700 for the fund portfolio of the average adviser, surpassing the
results of three of the four remaining advisers.

that, vital as those services may be, advisers as a group
cannot be credibly relied on to add value by selecting
winning funds for you.
Here is a final piece of compelling evidence to sup-
port that thesis. Mark Hulbert, editor of the Hulbert Fi-
nancial Digest, has been monitoring the real-time records
of financial advisers who report their recommendations in
newsletters subscribed to by investors. He has tracked the
performance of these advisers over the past 26 years, and
here’s what he finds:
•Of the 35 newsletters that existed in 1980, only
13 are still in business today. Only three outper-
formed the market over the subsequent 26 years.
•Of the other 22 advisers, only two were ahead
of the S&P 500 Index when they discontinued
publication.
•An initial $100,000 investment in the S&P 500
Index 26 years ago would be worth nearly
$2,500,000 today. By way of contrast, a similar
investment in the portfolios managed by the
advisers tracked by Hulbert would be worth
about $1,400,000.
Hulbert’s conclusion: “You can outperform more
than 80 percent of your fellow investors over the next sev-

eral decades simply by investing in an index fund—and
doing nothing else.”
(cid:2)
Index funds endure, while
most advisers and funds do not.
These examples surely reinforce the thesis that index
funds endure, while most advisers and funds do not; that
index fund returns strongly exceed the returns earned even
by those advisers and funds that do survive; that the odds
against successful fund selection by advisers are large, and
that compounding these rather consistent differentials in
rates of annual return mount up to truly staggering differ-
ences in wealth accumulation over the long term.
If you consider the selection of an adviser, please take
heed of these findings. If you decide to go ahead, make
sure you are paying a fair fee (which results in a deduction
from whatever rate of return your fund portfolio earns).
Since most investment advisory fees tend to begin in the
rangeof1percentperyear,besuretobalancetheworthof
the peripheral services that advisers provide against the re-
duction in your returns that those fees are likely to repre-
sent over time. Finally—and this will hardly surprise
you—look with particular favor on advisers who recom-
mend stock and bond index funds in their model portfolios.

Don’t Take My Word for It
Listen, once again, to the widely respected invest-
ment adviser William Bernstein,who writes in The
Four Pillars of Investment Wisdom as follows: “You
will want to ensure that your adviser is choosing
your investments purely on their investment merit
and not on the basis of how the vehicles reward him.
The warning signs here are recommendations of
load funds, insurance products, limited partner-
ships, or separate accounts. The best, and only, way
to make sure that you and your adviser are on the
same team is to make sure that he is ‘fee-only,’ that
is, that he receives no remuneration from any other
source besides you....‘Fee-only’ is not without pit-
falls, however. Your adviser’s fees should be reason-
able. It is simply not worth paying anybody more
than 1 percent to manage your money. Above $1
million, you should be paying no more than 0.75
percent, and above $5 million, no more than 0.5
percent....Your adviser should use index/passive
stock funds wherever possible. If he tells you that he
is able to find managers who can beat the indexes,
he is fooling both you and himself. I refer to a com-
mitment to passive indexing as ‘asset-class religion.’
Don’t hire anyone without it.”

thing that, deep down, our common sense tells us:
Performance comes and goes.

But there is also something else worth knowing: you
can be more successful in selecting winning funds by fo-
cusing, not on the inevitable evanescence of past perfor-
mance, but on something that seems to go on forever or,
more fairly, a factor that has persisted over all the fund in-
dustry’s long history. That factor is the costs of owning
mutual funds. Costs go on forever.
(cid:2)
Common sense tells us that performance comes
and goes, but costs go on forever.
One major cost is the fund’s expense ratio, and it tends
to change little over time. While some funds scale down
their fee rates as assets grow, the reductions are usually suf-
ficiently modest that high-cost funds tend to remain high-
cost; lower-cost funds tend to remain lower-cost, and the
few very low-cost funds tend to remain very low-cost. The
average-cost funds, too, tend to persist in that category.
Another large cost of equity fund ownership is the
sales charge paid on each purchase of shares. It, too,
tends to persist. Load funds rarely become no-load funds,
and vice versa. (I can recall no large fund organization
making the immediate conversion from a load to a no-
load distribution system since Vanguard took that drastic
and unprecedented step 30 years ago.)

bogl_c11.qxd 2/8/07 10:26 AM Page 115
FOCUS ON THE LOWEST-COST FUNDS [115]
The portfolio turnover costs of individual funds also
tend to persist. Transactions cost money, and we estimate
that turnover costs are roughly 0.5 percent on each purchase
and sale, meaning that a fund with 100 percent portfolio
turnover would carry a cost to shareholders of about 1
percent of assets, year after year. Similarly, 50 per-
cent turnover would cost about 0.50 percent; and 10 percent
turnover would cost about 0.10 percent, and so on. Rule of
thumb: turnover costs equal 1 percent of the turnover rate.
Most comparisons of fund costs rely solely on re-
ported expense ratios, and uniformly find that higher
costs are associated with lower returns. This pattern
holds not only for equity funds as a group, but in each of
the nine Morningstar style boxes (large-, mid-, and small-
cap funds, each sorted into fund groups with growth,
value, and blended objectives). While few independent
comparisons take into account the additional cost of fund
portfolio turnover, a similar relationship exists. Funds in
the low-turnover quartile have consistently outperformed
those in the high-turnover quartile for all equity funds as
a group, and in each of the nine style boxes.
Adding that estimated turnover cost to each fund’s
expense ratio makes the relationship sheer dynamite. Tak-
ing into account both costs, we find that the all-in annual
costs range from 0.9 percent of assets in the lowest-cost
quartile to 3.0 percent in the highest-cost quartile as

shown in Exhibit 11.1. (This exercise ignores sales
charges and, therefore overstates the net returns earned
by the funds in each quartile.)
Costs matter! That 2.1 percentage point difference
constitutes a huge portion of the 2.7 point advantage in
the returns among the lowest-cost funds over the highest-
cost funds during the past 10 years. Net annual return of
low-cost funds, 11.7 percent; net annual return of high-
cost funds, just 9.0 percent, a 30 percent enhancement in
each year’s return achieved simply by relying on relative
costs as a guide to performance success.
Also note that in each of the fund quartiles, when we
add the costs to the funds’ reported net returns, the gross
annual returns earned in each category are virtually iden-
tical. Pre-cost returns fall into a narrow range: a high of
12.8 percent for the third quartile and a low of 12.0 per-
cent for the fourth quartile, just what we might expect.
Costs account for most of the difference in the annual net
returns earned by the funds.
And there is another significant difference. Step by
step, as costs increase, so does risk (using the volatility of
monthly returns relative to the volatility of the S&P 500
Index as the measure). Those highest-expense, highest-
turnover-cost funds assumed fully 34 percent more risk
than their lowest-cost cousins. If you take that reduction
in risk into account, the risk-adjusted annual return for

the low-cost quartile comes to 11.9 percent, fully 47 per-
cent higher than the 8.1 percent risk-adjusted return of
the high-cost quartile.
When we compound those annual returns over time,
the cumulative difference reaches staggering proportions.
Total compound gain for the period: 207 percent for the
low-cost funds, 118 percent for the high-cost funds, a
near doubling of profit arising almost entirely from the
cost differential. Talk about the relentless rules of humble
arithmetic!
In other words, the final value of the low-cost funds
more than tripled over the decade, whereas the value of
the high-cost funds barely doubled. Surely “fishing in the
low-cost pond” should enhance your returns, and by a
wide margin at that. Again, yes, costs matter!
But if you are seeking the lowest-cost funds, why limit
the search to actively managed funds? The classic index
fund had the lowest costs of all: an expense ratio averaging
0.2 percent per year during this period. With no measura-
ble turnover costs, its total all-in costs were but 0.2 per-
cent. The gross return of the 500 Index Fund was 11.4
percent per year; the net return 11.2 percent. Carrying a
lower risk than any of the four cost quartiles (annual price
volatility averaging 15.7 percent), its risk-adjusted annual
return was 11.4 percent, for a cumulative risk-adjusted
gain that was about in the middle of the top quartile.

(cid:2)
The index fund’s risk-adjusted return: 194
percent; average managed fund, 154 percent.
The index fund’s compound risk-adjusted profit of
194 percent surpassed the 154 percent compound profit
earned by the average fund by about one-third, all the
more impressive since that average is overstated (as al-
ways) by the fact that only the funds that were good
enough to survive the decade are included in the data.
What’s more, selecting the index fund eliminated the
need to look for those rare needles in the market
haystack represented by the very few active funds that
have performed better than that haystack, in the often-
vain hope that their winning ways will continue over
decades yet to come.
If investors could rely on only a single factor to select
future superior performers and to avoid future inferior
performers, it would be fund costs. The record could
hardly be clearer: the more the managers and brokers
take, the less the investors make. So why not own an
index fund with no active manager and no management
fee, and with virtually no trading of stocks through those
Helpers mentioned in Chapter 1? Why not, indeed?
Chapter 12 explores this idea further.

Don’t Take My Word for It
Beginning as far back as 1995, Tyler Mathisen,
then executive editor of Money,conceded the point:
“For nearly two decades, John Bogle, the tart-
tongued chairman of the Vanguard Group, has
preached the virtues of index funds—those boring
portfolios that aim to match the performance of a
market barometer. And for much of that time, mil-
lions of fund investors (not to mention dozens of fi-
nancial journalists including this one) basically
ignored him. Sure, we recognized the intrinsic mer-
its of index funds such as low annual expenses and
because the funds keep turnover to a minimum, tiny
transaction costs. Moreover, because index fund
managers convert paper profits into realized gains
less frequently than do the skippers of actively man-
aged funds, shareholders pay less tax each year to
Uncle Sam. To be sure, those three advantages
form a trio as impressive as Domingo, Pavarotti,
and Carreras.
“Well, Jack, we were wrong. You win. Settling
for average is good enough, at least for a substantial
portion of most investors’ stock and bond portfo-
lios. In fact, more often than not, aiming for bench-
mark-matching returns through index funds assures
shareholders of a better-than-average chance of out-
performing the typical managed stock or bond port-
folio. It’s the paradox of fund investing today:

Gunning for average is your best shot at finishing
above average. We’ve come around to agreeing with
the sometimes prickly, always provocative, fund exec
known to admirers and detractors alike as Saint Jack:
Indexing should form the core of most investors’ fund
portfolios. So here’s to you, Jack. You have a right to
call it, as you recently did in a booklet you wrote, The
Triumph of Indexing.”(Thanks, Tyler!)

turnover costs that turn out to be zero. They have all-in

even than the 90 basis points for the low-cost quartile of
funds described in Chapter 11.
And it works. Witness the real-world superiority of the
S&P 500 Index Fund compared with the average equity
fund over the past 25 years and over the previous decade,
as described in earlier chapters. The case for the success
of indexing in the past is compelling and unarguable. And
with the outlook for subdued returns on stocks during the
decade ahead, I am concluding my anecdotal stroll through
the relentless rules of humble arithmetic with a final statis-
tical example that suggests what the future may hold.
We can, in fact, use statistics designed to project the
odds that a passively managed index fund will outpace an
actively managed equity fund over various time periods.
The complex exercise is called the “Monte Carlo simula-
tion.”* What it does is make a few simple assumptions
about the volatility of equity fund returns and the extent
to which they vary from the returns earned in the stock
market, as well as an assumption about the all-in costs of
equity investing. The particular example presented here
assumes that index fund costs will run to 0.25 percent per
year and that the costs of active management will run to 2
*Basically, a Monte Carlo simulation takes all the monthly returns earned
by stocks over a long period—even a full century—scrambles them ran-
domly, and then computes the annual rates of return generated by each of
the thousands of hypothetical portfolios.

percent per year. (Index funds are available at far lower
costs, and the typical equity fund has even higher costs,
so we’ve given actively managed funds the benefit of a
very large doubt.)
Result: Over one year, about 29 percent of active
managers on average, would be expected to outpace the
index; over five years about 15 percent would be expected
to win; over 10 years, 9 percent; over 25 years, 5 percent;
and over 50 years just 2 percent of active managers would
be expected to win (Exhibit 12.1).
How will the future actually play out? Of course,
we can’t be sure. But we know what the past 25 years
look like, and we know that over the past 35 years only

9 of the 355 funds in business at the outset outper-
formed the stock market index by more than 2 percent
per year. What’s more, even the majority of these
winners lost their early edge a decade or more ago.
So it looks as if our statistical odds are in the right
ballpark. This arithmetic suggests—even demands—
that index funds deserve an important place in your
portfolio, even as they constitute the overriding portion
of my own.
Whatever the case, in the era of subdued stock and
bond market returns that most likely lies in prospect,
fund costs will become more important than ever. Even
more so when we move from the illusion that mutual
funds as a group can capture whatever returns our finan-
cial markets provide to the even greater illusion that most
mutual fund investors can capture even those depleted re-
turns in their own fund portfolios. What the index fund
has going for it is, as I have often said, “the magic of sim-
plicity in an empire of parsimony.”
To reiterate: all those pesky costs—fund expense ra-
tios, sales charges, and turnover costs; tax costs; and the
most subtle cost of all, the rising cost of living (infla-
tion)—are virtually guaranteed to erode the spending
power of our investments over time. What’s more, only in
the rarest cases do fund investors actually succeed in cap-
turing the returns that the funds report.

My conclusions about the market returns we can
expect in the years ahead, as well as my conclusions
about the share of those returns that funds will

All index funds are not created equal.
One example: the difference
between $122,700 and $99,100.
I should add, importantly, that all index funds are not
created equal. While their index-based portfolios are sub-
stantially identical, their costs are anything but identical.
Some have miniscule expense ratios; others have expense
ratios that surpass the bounds of reason. Some are no-load
funds, but nearly a third, as it turns out, have substantial
front-end loads, often with an option to pay those loads
over a period of (usually) five years; others entail the pay-
ment of a standard brokerage commission.
The gap between the costs charged by the low-cost funds
and the high-cost funds offered by 10 major fund organiza-
tions for their S&P 500-Index-based funds runs upward of an
amazing 1.2 percentage points per year. (Exhibit12.2)
Today, there are some 115 index mutual funds designed
to track the S&P 500 Index. Astonishingly, more than half
of them carry an initial sales load, albeit often concealed by
offering class “B” shares with no front-end load but with an
additional heavy annual fee (used to pay the broker). The
wise investor will select only those index funds that are avail-
able without sales loads, and those operating with the lowest
costs. These costs—no surprise here!—are directly related to
the net returns delivered to the shareholders of these funds.

In the past, some S&P 500-Index-based funds may
have earned small increases in return (or been penalized by
small reductions) based on their managers’ ability (or in-
ability) to employ strategies that allow small short-term
departures from the exact weightings of the stocks in the
index. I assume, however, that these variations will be
lower in the future, and have therefore ignored them as an
element in the cost-value equation. Funds tracking a par-
ticular index are—or should be—commodities in terms of
their portfolios and the returns they provide. So variations

in costs make the difference. While cost differentials may
look trivial when expressed on an annual basis, com-
pounded over the years they make the difference between
investment success and failure.
In January 1984, the second index mutual fund was
formed—Wells Fargo Equity Index Fund. Its subsequent
return can be compared with that of the original Van-
guard 500 Index Fund over the same period. Both funds
selected the S&P 500 Index as their benchmark. The
sales commission on the Vanguard Index 500 Fund was
eliminated within months of its initial offering, and it has
operated with an expense ratio averaging 0.28 percent an-
nually. (By 2005, the ratio had decreased to 0.18 percent,
and to 0.09 percent for longer-term investors and those
who had $100,000 or more invested in the fund.) In con-
trast, the Wells Fargo fund carried an initial sales charge
of 5.5 percent througout the period, and its expense ratio
averaged 0.80 percent per year (0.64 percent in 2005).
These seemingly small differences added up to a 23
percent enhancement in value for the Vanguard fund. An
original investment of $10,000 in each produced a profit
of $122,700 for the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, compared
with $99,100 for the Wells Fargo Equity Index Fund. All
index funds are not created equal. Intelligent investors
will select the lowest cost index funds that are available
from reputable fund organizations.

Your index fund should not be your manager’s
cash cow. It should be your own cash cow.
Some years ago, a Wells Fargo representative was
asked how the firm could justify such high charges. The
answer: “You don’t understand. It’s our cash cow.” (That
is, it regularly generates lots of profits for the manager.)
By carefully selecting the lowest cost index funds for your
portfolio, you can be sure that the fund is not the man-
ager’s cash cow, but your own.
Given my preference for the all-market index fund, I
almost hesitate to tell you that, since that lonely first S&P
Index was formed in 1975, a staggering total of another
578 more index funds of all sizes and shapes are now in
operation. Investors face a mind-boggling set of confus-
ing choices—large cap, mid-cap, small-cap, industry sec-
tors, international, single country, and so on. To make it
more confusing, indexing works like a charm in every one
of these areas. A well-administered index fund is in-
evitably destined to surpass the returns earned by the
other investors in the market segment tracked by its
index. Even though we never have complete information
about the precise returns earned by investors as a group
in each segment, given the relentless rules of humble
arithmetic, it mustwork that way.

Standard & Poor’s Corporationnowcompares index
returns with actual returns achieved by active managers
in many U.S. market segments, and the results are un-
mistakable. Over the past five years alone, the S&P
500 Index has outpaced 67 percent of large-cap gen-
eral equity funds, while the S&P Mid-Cap 400 Index
has outperformed 84 percent of mid-cap funds, and the
S&P Small-Cap 600 Index has outperformed 79 per-
cent of all small-cap funds. Remarkable but unsurpris-
ing. While these comparisons, sorted by number of
funds rather than by fund assets, have the flaws noted
earlier, the message could hardly be clearer: indexing
is the winning strategy.
Interestingly, Standard & Poor’s tries to take survivor
bias into account in its calculations. During the past five
years alone, an astonishing 28 percent of all general eq-
uity funds have gone out of business. That’s one more
warning about relying on actively managed mutual funds
as long-term investments.

In inefficient markets, the most successful
managers may achieve unusually large returns.
But common sense tells us that for each big
success, there must also be a big failure.

While it is alleged that indexing doesn’t work in mar-
kets that are less-efficient than the large stocks in the
S&P 500, the impressive performance of the small- and
mid-cap indexes suggest that it works perfectly well. As it
must. For, whether markets are efficient or inefficient, as
a group all investors in that segment earn the return of
that segment. In inefficient markets, the most successful
managers may achieve unusually large returns. But never
forget that, as a group, all investors in any discrete seg-
ment of the stock market must be, and are, average.
Common sense tells us that for each big success, there
must also be a big failure. But after all those deductions
of even larger management fees that funds incur in less
efficient markets, and the damaging impact of their even
larger turnover costs, the aggregate lag is even wider. So
even in inefficient market segments, index funds, with
their tiny costs, win again.
International funds are also subject to the same allega-
tion that it is easier for managers to win in (supposedly)
less-efficient markets. But also to no avail. S&P reports that
the international index (world markets, less U.S. stocks)
outpaced 80 percent of actively managed international eq-
uity funds over the past five years. Similarly, the S&P
Emerging Markets Index outpaced 88 percent of emerging
market funds. With indexing so successful in both more ef-
ficient and less efficient markets alike, and in U.S. markets

and global markets, I’m not sure what additional data are
required to close the case in favor of index funds.
But while investing in particular market sectors is
done most efficiently through index funds, betting on the
winning sectors is exactly that: betting. But betting is a
loser’s game. Why? Largely because emotions are almost
certain to have a powerful negative impact on the returns
that investors achieve. Whatever returns each sector may
earn, the investors in those very sectors will likely, if not
certainly, fall well behind them. For there is abundant evi-
dence that the most popular sector funds of the day are
those that have recently enjoyed the most spectacular re-
cent performance. As a result, after-the-fact popularity is
a recipe for unsuccessful investing.

Indexing stock market sectors, a strong idea.
Betting on stock market sectors, a weak reality.

seeking higher income, and were happy to reduce their

risks. Alas, while the original idea was strong, the ensuing
reality was weak. What followed their introduction was a
classic example of performance chasing.
During the 1993 to 1997 period, the stock market
was relatively placid, and value stocks and growth stocks
delivered similar returns. Then in the new economy bub-
ble, growth stocks took off, earning a cumulative return
by 2000 that left value stocks in the dust (1992 to March
2000: Growth Index total return, 364 percent; Value
Index total return, 229 percent). Après moi le deluge!Re-
version to the mean took hold, and growth stocks plum-
meted through 2002.
Investor interest in the two fund styles was well balanced
during the early years. But in the bubble that followed, in-
vestors poured $11 billion into the soaring Growth Index
Fund, nearly four times the $3 billion invested in the sedate
Value Index Fund. Then, in the aftermath, investors
switched their loyalty, with net redemptions of $850 million
in the Growth Index Fund during 2001 to 2006 and net pur-
chases approaching $2 billion in the Value Index Fund.
Since 1993, the two funds have achieved substantial
positive returns on the standard time-weighted basis—9.1
percent per year for Growth and 11.2 percent for Value.
With their counterproductive timing and selection, how-
ever, investors in these index funds have not come even close
to matching those returns. The average dollar-weighted

PROFIT FROM THE MAJESTY OF SIMPLICITY [135]
return earned by investors in the Growth Index Fund was a
pathetic 0.9 percent per year. While investors in the Value
Index Fund did better, their return of 7.6 percent still
lagged the return on the Value Index Fund by 3.6 percent-
age points per year.
Since 1993, the cumulative return of the Growth
Index has been 224 percent, versus 320 percent for the
Value Index, based on the traditional calculation of fund
performance. The Growth Index Fund investor, mean-
while, earned but 13 percent, and the Value Index Fund
investor earned about 170 percent. Despite my best in-
tentions when they were formed, Vanguard’s Growth
Fund and Value Index Funds proved to be a paradigm for
the ways that investors fool themselves, relinquishing per-
fectly acceptable long-term returns in their search to find
the Holy Grail of extra returns in the short run.
So look before you leap in trying to pick which mar-
ket sector to bet on. It may not be as exciting, but owning
the classic stock market index fund is the ultimate strat-
egy. It holds the mathematical certainty that marks it as
the gold standard in investing, for try as they might, the
alchemists of active management cannot turn their own
lead, copper, or iron into gold. Just avoid complexity, rely
on simplicity, take costs out of the equation and trust the
arithmetic.

Don’t Take My Word for It
You may think that I am too pessimistic in calculat-
ing the odds that only 2 percent of all equity mutual
portfolios will outperform the stock market over 50
years. If so, consider the odds calculated by
Michael J. Mauboussin, chief market strategist at
Legg Mason, adjunct professor at Columbia Busi-
ness School, and author of the best-selling More
than You Know. While my 2 percent estimate would
mean that 1 portfolio in 50 would outperform the
stock market over 50 years, Mauboussin calculates
the odds of a fund outperforming for 15 years con-
secutively at 1 in 223,000, and at 1 in 31 million
over 21 years. Either way, the odds of outpacing an
all-market index fund are, well, terrible.
Now listen to Warren Buffett’s widely es-
teemed partner Charlie Munger,who eloquently
states the case for shunning the foolish complex-
ity of investing and opting for simplicity: “At
large charitable foundations in recent years there
has been a drift toward more complexity. In some
endowment funds, there are not few but many in-
vestment counselors, chosen by an additional
layer of consultants who are hired to decide which
investment counselors are best, help in allocating

funds to various categories, insure that claimed in-
vestment styles are scrupulously followed...[plus]
a third layer of the security analysts employed by in-
vestment banks. There is one thing sure about all
this complexity, the total cost of all the investment
management, plus the frictional costs of fairly often
getting in and out of many large investment posi-
tions, can easily reach 3 percent of foundation net
worth per annum. All the equity investors, in total,
will surely bear a performance disadvantage per
annum equal to the total croupiers’ costs they have
jointly elected to bear....And it is unescapable that
exactly half of the investors will get a result below the
median result after the croupier’s take, a median re-
sult that may well be somewhere between unexciting
and lousy. The wiser choice is to dispense with the
consultants and reduce the investment turnover, by
changing to indexed investment in equities.” (Once
again, shades of the Gotrocks family.)

Where Those Relentless Rules
Are Even More Powerful
S
OFAR, MYDISCUSSIONof the index fund (and its hand-
maiden, low investment costs) has related to the stock
market and to equity mutual funds. But the relentless
rules of humble arithmetic with which I’ve regaled you
also apply—arguably even more forcefully—to bond funds
and money market funds.
Perhaps it’s obvious why this is so. While a seemingly
infinite number of factors influence the stock market and
each individual stock that is traded there, a single factor



==================================================
                     PAGE 166                     
==================================================

BOND FUNDS AND MONEY MARKET FUNDS [139]
influences the bond market and the money market (and
for that matter, each individual fixed-income security) far
more than any other: the prevailing level of interest rates.
Managers of fixed-income funds can’t do much, if any-
thing, to influence rates. If they don’t like the rates estab-
lished in that market, calling the Treasury Department or
the Federal Reserve, or otherwise trying to change the
supply-and-demand equation, is unlikely to bear fruit.
So let’s be clear: In the long run, virtually 100 percent
of the return on any bond fund or money market fund is
accounted for by the net interest income it generates for
its shareholders. The only way for a manager to add an in-
crement to that return is to make interest rate bets—for
example, by selling bonds when he expects rates to go up
(and prices down), and then buying bonds when the re-
verse is expected to happen. If you think that picking
stocks and timing their purchase is hard, just imagine how
hard it is to execute these same strategies successfully in
the incredibly efficient precincts of the bond market.
Thus, managers of fixed income funds almost in-
evitably deliver a gross return that parallels the baseline
constituted by the interest rate environment. Yes, a few
managers might do better—even do better for a long
time—by being extra smart, or extra lucky, or by taking
extra risk. Yet even the best bond and money market man-
agers can add only a few fractions of one percent per year

to your long-term returns, albeit only by risking a compa-
rable shortfall. What’s more, even if they achieve these
margins, they rarely overcome the fees, sales loads, and
expenses involved in acquiring their services.
While these costs make the task of adding returns far
more difficult, overly confident bond fund managers may
be tempted to take just a little extra risk by extending ma-
turities of the bonds in the portfolio. (Long-dated bonds—
say, 30 years—are much more volatile than short-term
bonds—say, two years—but usually provide higher yields.)
They are also tempted to reduce the investment quality of
the portfolio, holding less in U.S. Treasury bonds (rated
AAA) or in investment-grade corporate bonds (rated
BBB or better), and holding more in below-investment-
grade bonds (BB or lower), or even some so-called junk
bonds, rated below CC or even unrated.
Since stocks represent the residual ownership (or equity)
of corporations, the word safety is not usually associated
with them. Unlike bonds, stocks can’t default. Bonds, on
the other hand, represent debt. If the payments of interest
that corporations and governments promise to make every
six months are threatened, their ratings will be downgraded
and the market value of their bonds reduced. And if they fi-
nally fail to make the promised payments, they enter bank-
ruptcy proceedings. Where bonds are concerned, Brandeis’s
warning becomes particularly meaningful: “Remember, O

stranger, arithmetic is the first of the sciences and the
mother of safety.”
There are too many types of bond funds to try your pa-
tience by examining all of them. So this chapter presents the
three basic maturity levels that have become the industry
standard, one in each of the three major bond segments—
taxable (corporate and government) bonds, tax-exempt mu-
nicipal bonds, and U.S. Treasury issues. The discussion
begins with intermediate-term taxable bond funds; then
turns to long-term tax-exempt bond funds; and finally evalu-
ates funds investing in short-term U.S. Treasury notes.
(cid:2)
Among intermediate-term taxable
bond funds, the low-cost index fund
is truly a superior performer.
As you’ll see, the low-cost intermediate-term bond
index fund is a truly superior performer* (Exhibit 13.1).
(A finding that indexing wins should no longer surprise
you.) With a 10-year return averaging 6.8 percent annu-
ally, it comes within a whisker of outpacing the (cost-
adjusted) return of the comparable Lehman 5–10 Year
*I apologize, sort of, for using Vanguard funds for the examples of market
indexes. But there are few other bond funds in these categories that imple-
ment index or index-like strategies, and literally none with lower costs for
individual investors.

Government/Corporate Bond Index. What is more, the
index fund’s annual return of 6.8 percent was almost 25
percent higher than the 5.5 percent return of its average
peer. While the actively managed bond funds as a group
earned a lower gross return than either the index fund or
the index, relative cost proved to be the principal differen-
tiator in net return.
As a group, the portfolios of the actively managed
bond funds include about 25 percent corporate and 75 per-
cent U.S. government bonds (largely bonds of government
agencies), whereas the bond index and the bond index fund
include about 50 percent in corporates and 50 percent in
governments. While the bond index fund carried slightly
more volatility risk (with an annualized standard deviation

of 5 percent versus 3.7 percent for the active managers),
both figures represent an extremely low risk level.
And so the message echoes. Among intermediate-term
taxable bond funds, in terms of maximizing your return and
minimizing your risk, the low-cost index fund is truly a su-
perior performer. The Vanguard Intermediate-Term Bond
Index Fund, for example, has an expense ratio of 0.18 per-
cent, less than one-fifth of the 1.0 percent expense ratio of
its average peer. In addition, its return benefits from the
absence of sales loads. Always avoid bond funds with sales
loads. (A typical 5 percent load would obliterate your en-
tire yield for the first year.) With a cumulative final value
of an initial investment of $10,000 growing to $19,289 in
the index fund, versus just $17,081 for its average rival, the
index strategy is a winning strategy, outpacing an amazing
550 of its 570 peers over the past decade.
(cid:2)
Among long-term tax-exempt bond funds,
once again, indexing wins.
Now let’s consider long-term maturities, with a
focus on tax-exempt municipal bond funds. Because of
complexities in the construction of municipal bond in-
dexes, there are no pure index funds in this category.
But the results of the major index in the field (the

confirm the power of indexing in surpassing the returns
provided by the average active bond manager (Exhibit
13.2). Since the index provided a gross return of 5.93
percent, a comparable index fund, after assumed costs
of 0.20 percent, would have provided a 5.73 percent net
annual return.
By way of comparison, the Vanguard Long-Term
Tax-Exempt Bond Fund—whose expense ratio of 0.15
percent is actually slightly below these assumed costs for
the index fund—provided a net return of 5.85 percent, a
bit higher than the assumed return of the bond index
fund. Like the index fund, this bond fund is broadly di-
versified, holds a high-quality portfolio (87 percent rated

A or better, even higher than its actively managed peers),
and minimizes turnover.
Once again, low costs lead to higher returns. The 5.73
percent annual return of the hypothetical municipal bond
index fund was roughly 15 percent more than the 5.0 per-
cent earned by the average long-term municipal fund, even
though the actively managed funds were assuming higher
risks—15 percent in lower-rated bonds versus 4 percent for
the index and 13 percent for the Vanguard fund.
Over the past decade, $10,000 initially invested in the
Vanguard Long-Term Municipal Bond Fund grew to
$17,657, versus $16,306 for its average rival. With low-
costs, broad diversification, and no serious attempt to
outguess the market in long-term tax-exempt bond funds,
once again indexing wins. Its close proxy, the Vanguard
Long-Term Municipal Bond Fund, ranked first among its
194 peers.

Among short-term Treasury funds,
the lowest cost option wins again.
Our sweep of the bond fund arena concludes with an
examination of short-term funds investing in U.S. Trea-
sury obligations (Exhibit 13.3). There are few surprises
here. The net return earned by the index itself (5.06 per-

0.20 percent) outpaces the average fund. Again, while the
Vanguard Short-Term Government Bond Fund is not,
technically speaking, an index fund, it tracks the index re-
turn with remarkable precision, turning in a net average
annual return of 5.06 percent over the past decade. The
lowest cost options win again, outpacing 97 of the 122
short-term government funds. (Treasurys being Trea-
surys, investment quality is virtually uniform. Both the
Vanguard index fund and the index itself hold 100 percent
of their portfolios in short-term U.S. Treasury notes, and
the active funds hold 99 percent.)
With its towering 0.92 percent average expense ratio,
the average short-term bond fund has a lot to overcome. It
doesn’t succeed—it can’t succeed—in overcoming that hand-
icap, even by assuming somewhat more volatility risk than
the government index and the Vanguard, both of which

funds displayed slightly less volatility than their active peers.
(Again, many of these actively managed funds carry sales
charges, averaging 3 percent, which are incorporated into
the returns shown in Exhibit 13.3.)
The tracking of its benchmark, its quality parity, and
its extremely low expenses mark the Vanguard Short-
Term Treasury Bond Fund as the functional equivalent of
the Lehman 1–5 Year Government Bond Index. While
there are no bond funds that track this index, the Van-
guard fund is the virtual equivalent of an index fund. Both
provided cumulative gains on an initial investment of
$10,000 of an identical $16,382 over the past decade,
compared with $15,588 for the average short-term Trea-
sury fund.
(cid:2)
Among money market funds—surprise!
—low cost wins again.
Money market funds can be thought of as very
short-term bond funds with uniformly high credit qual-
ity. Federal regulations limit money market funds to
high-grade commercial and bank paper, and as a practi-
cal matter limit maturities to a very short term (about
60 days), to maintain a stable asset value of $1.00 per
share. (Unlike bank savings accounts, money market

funds are not guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insur-
ance Corporation.) As a result, money market funds
hold portfolios with generally similar quality (though a
bit of “stretching” for yield often goes on) and very
short maturity (usually averaging about 40 days). As a
result, they tend to earn substantially identical gross
yields on their portfolios.
With their short maturities, extremely high credit
quality, and broadly diversified portfolios, money mar-
ket funds essentially become commodities. Thus, when
all else is equal (as it is here), relative performance is
determined by relative cost. So, even more than in stock
index funds and bond index funds, cost tells virtually
the entire story in money market funds.
If we rank the records of all 190 money market funds
in terms of the returns they have delivered to investors
over the past 10 years (highest first) and then compare
their expense ratio (lowest first), the relationship is almost
perfect. Exhibit 13.4 echoes the cost versus return analy-
sis of Exhibits 13.1 to 13.3. The Vanguard Prime Money
Market Fund, close cousin to our hypothetical index
fund, was among the leaders, producing a net annual re-
turn of 3.77 percent for the past decade, some 15 percent
above the return on the average money market fund. Cu-
mulatively, a $10,000 initial investment in the Vanguard
Prime Money Market Fund grew to $14,478 over the

190 comparable funds, it ranked number 7.
Remarkably, while the data are not shown in Exhibit
13.4, money market funds in the high-cost quartile earned
a gross return of 4.10 percent (about equal to the average).
But with a shocking annual expense ratio of 1.39 percent,
these high-cost funds delivered a net return of just 2.71
percent to their owners. Why would investors pay more
than a 0.50 percent annual cost for a money market fund?
The answer is beyond me. (They should probably have
their heads examined.) How the supposedly independent
directors of these 45 money funds with expense ratios at or
above the 1.00 percent level could vote to approve such
fees is an even bigger question. Their job is to represent
the interests of the fund shareholders, and they have failed.
But intelligent investors don’t need to fail. If you avoid

these high-cost money market funds in favor of low-cost
funds, you inevitably earn superior returns.
* * *
Summing up, I realize full well that investors are far
more focused on equity funds and the stock market than on
fixed-income funds. Nonetheless, smart investors will save
themselves lots of money—and substantially improve their
returns—if they apply the same principles of broad diversifi-
cation, low-cost, no-load, minimal turnover, and long-term
investing when they select fixed income funds. These are
the very commonsense characteristics that enable index
funds to guarantee your fair share of the returns in the bond
and money markets, even as they do in all financial markets.
Don’t Take My Word for It
While not a lot has been written about the remarkable
(and remarkably obvious) value of index funds that in-
vest in bonds, the convictions expressed in this chapter
have been strongly reinforced by Walter R. Good,
CFA and Roy W. Hermansen, CFA, in Index Your
Way to Investment Success. “Comparison of expenses,
transaction costs, and, where applicable, sales loads
identify the cost advantage for bond index funds.
For the purposes of projecting returns, let’s assume

that the actively managed fund and the benchmark
index fund each hold bonds that, overall, yield the
same 7 percent annual rate of return. For the actively-
managed load funds, the index fund advantage
amounts to 1.2 percentage points per year. The data
provide a sobering glimpse of the challenge encoun-
tered by the active bond fund manager...and suggest
how much additional return active management may
have to add—on average over an extended period—
just to break even!...Near-index bond mutual funds
provide an alternative to indexing the bond market.
While the funds do not completely conform to the
index fund model, they share key characteristics: very
high degree of diversification [in the specified market
segment], very low expense ratio, very low transaction
costs, and absence of sales loads.”
Once again, further confirmation comes from
across the pond. England’s Timothy Hale, author
of Smarter Investing—Simpler Decisions forBetterRe-
sults, writes, “You should not overlook the efficacy
of index investing for bonds, which up to now has
been whispered rather than shouted from the
rooftops. The evidence is compelling and comes
down firmly in favor of investing in index
funds....Over the ten-year period 1988–1998,
US bond index funds returned 8.9 per cent a year
against 8.2 per cent for actively managed bond
funds (with) index funds beating 85 per cent of all
active funds. This differential is largely due to fees.”

That Promise to Beat

(cid:2)
The New Paradigm?
S
INCE THE INCEPTION OF the first index mutual fund in
1975, indexing—investing in passively managed, broadly
diversified, low-cost, stock and bond index funds—has
proved to be both a remarkable artistic success and a re-
markable commercial success. In previous chapters,
we’ve evaluated the success of index funds in providing
returns to investors that have vastly surpassed the returns
achieved by investors in actively managed mutual funds.

bogl_c14.qxd 2/8/07 10:27 AM Page 153
INDEX FUNDS THAT PROMISE TO BEAT THE MARKET [153]
Given that artistic success, the commercial success of
indexing is hardly surprising. Today, most indexed assets
are concentrated in classic index funds representing the
broad U.S. stock market (the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones
Wilshire 5000) the broad international stock market (the
Morgan Stanley EAFE [Europe, Australia, and Far East]
Index); and the broad U.S. bond market. Assets of these
traditional classic stock index funds have grown from $16
million in 1976 to $445 million in 1986, to $68 billion in
1996, to $369 billion in 2006—7 percent of the assets of
all equity mutual funds. Assets of bond index funds have
also soared—from $132 million in 1986, to $6 billion in
1996, to $62 billion in 2006—7 percent of the assets of all
taxable bond funds.
Indexing has become a competitive field. The largest
managers of the classic index funds are engaged in a
fiercely competitive price war, cutting their expense ratios
to draw the assets of investors who are smart enough to
realize the price is the difference. This trend is great for
index fund investors. But it slashes profits to index fund
managers and discourages entrepreneurs who start new
fund ventures in the hopes of enriching themselves by
building fund empires.
So how can promoters take advantage of the proven
attributesthatunderliethesuccessofthetraditionalindex

consistently outpace the broad market indexes that up
untilnowhaveprettymuchdefinedhowwethinkofindex-
ing. And then charge a higher fee for that higher poten-
tial reward, whether or not it is ever actually delivered.
Traditional indexes, as noted in Chapter 3, are cap-
weighted. That is, the weight of each stock (or bond) in
the index portfolio is determined by its market capitaliza-
tion. The total U.S. stock market, with a value of $15
trillion, represents the collective investment of all stock-
holders of U.S. equities. So it follows that, together, all
investors as a group earn precisely the market’s return.
(Remember the Gotrocks family, in Chapter 1.)
If the market rises by 10 percent, all investors as a group
earn 10 percent (before costs). So the miracle, as it were, of
the index fund, is simple arithmetic. By minimizing all those
costs of investing, it guarantees that its participants will earn
higher net returns than all the other participants in stock
ownership as a group. This is the onlyapproach to equity in-
vesting that can guarantee such an outcome.

strive to do, individually. But collectively, they can’t suc-
ceed. For their trading merely shifts ownership from one
holder to another. All that swapping of stock certificates
back and forth, however it may work out for a given buyer
or seller, enriches only our financial intermediaries.
The active money manager, in effect, puts forth this ar-
gument. “I’m smarter than the others in the market. I can
discover undervalued stocks, and when the market discovers
them and they rise in price I’ll sell them. Then I’ll discover
other undervalued stocks and repeat the process all over
again. I know that the stock market is highly efficient, but
through my intelligence, my expert analysts, my computer
programs, and my trading strategies, I can spot temporary
inefficiencies and capture them, over and over again.”
As we have seen in Chapter 8, some fund managers
have actually succeeded in this task. But they are precious
few in number—over the past 36 years, just three funds
out of 355—8⁄ of 1 percent—have consistently distin-
10
guished themselves. Nonetheless, hope springs eternal
among money managers, and they strive for excellence.
Of course, they believe in themselves. (This field has few
shrinking violets!) But they also have a vested financial in-
terest in persuading investors that if they have done well
in the past they will continue to do so in the future. And
if they haven’t done well in the past, well, better days are
always ahead.

[156] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING
In recent years, something new has been added to the
mix. There are now financial entrepreneurs who believe,
I’m sure, sincerely (if with a heavy dollop of self-interest),
that they can create indexes that will beat the market. In-
teresting! They have developed new methods of weighting
portfolio holdings that they vow will outperform the tradi-
tional market-cap-weighted portfolio that represents the
holdings of investors as a group.
This new breed of indexers—not, in fact, indexers,
but active strategists—focuses on weighting portfolios by
so-called fundamental factors. Rather than weighting by
market cap, they use a combination of factors such as cor-
porate revenues, cash flows, profits, or dividends (for ex-
ample, the portfolio may be weighted by the dollar
amount of dividends distributed by each corporation,
rather than the dollar amount of its market capitaliza-
tion). They argue, fairly enough, that in a cap-weighted
portfolio, half of the stocks are overvalued to a greater or
lesser extent, and half are undervalued.
(cid:2)
No one would have the temerity to promote a
new strategy that has lagged in the past.
The traditional indexer responds: “Of course. But who
really knows which half is which?” The new fundamental

==================================================

bogl_c14.qxd 2/8/07 10:27 AM Page 157
INDEX FUNDS THAT PROMISE TO BEAT THE MARKET [157]
indexers unabashedly answer, “We do.” They actually claim
to know which is which. And—this will not surprise you—
the fundamental factors they have identified as the basis for
their portfolio selections actually have outpaced the tradi-
tional indexes in the past. (We call this data mining.For you
can be sure that no one would have the temerity to promote
a new strategy that has lagged the traditional index fund in
the past.)
The members of this new breed are not shy about their
prescience. They claim variously, if a tad grandiosely, that
they represent a “new wave” in indexing, a “revolution”
that will offer investors better returns and lower volatility,
and a “new paradigm.” Indeed, they describe themselves
as the new Copernicans, after the man who concluded that
the center of the solar system was not the earth, but the
sun. They compare the traditional market-cap weighted in-
dexers with ancient astronomers who attempted to perpet-
uate the Ptolemaic view of an earth-centered universe.
And they assure the world that we’re at the brink of a
“huge paradigm shift” in indexing.
They come armed with vast statistical studies that
prove how well their methodologies have worked in the past
(or at least since 1962, when their back-tested studies
began). But think for a moment about the message of
Chapter 8: in mutual fund investing, the past is not pro-
logue.These new paradigmists casually ignore that truism.

[158] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING
For example: “Dividend indexes outperform capitalized-
weighted indexes.” (Not, “have outperformed in the
past.”) “The fundamental index adds more than twice as
much incremental return.” (Not, “has added in the past.”)
Investors (and managers, too) love to believe that
the past is prologue. It would make life so easy. But
it is no accident that these new index funds are being
introduced only after their strategies have seen their
best days. Following the stock market bubble burst in
2000, value stocks outpaced growth stocks (the mar-
ket-cap index holds both) over the subsequent five
years; and for dividend-paying stocks, the pattern is
about the same.
Even including this recent advantage, the long-term
margins of superiority achieved by these theoretically
constructed back-tested portfolios are not large—between
1 percent and 2 percent per year. How much of that edge
would have been confiscated by their expense ratios?
(The lowest is 0.28 percent; the average is about 0.50
percent; the highest that I’ve seen is 1.89 percent.) How
much would have been confiscated by their extra portfolio
turnover costs compared with the classic index funds?
How much would have been confiscated by extra taxes
paid by shareholders when that turnover resulted in
gains? Even if the modest margins claimed in the past
were to repeat—which, I believe, is highly unlikely—these

back-tested hypothetical returns would be significantly
eroded, if not totally erased, by those costs.
(cid:2)
If these paradigms actually have been right in the
past, won’t they therefore be wrong in the future?
But the central issue remains: how can one claim that the
past will be prologue without a scintilla of apparent doubt?
The new paradigmists have never explained why these funda-
mental factors have been systematically underpriced by the
market in the past. And, if they have been underpriced, why
investors, hungry to capitalize on that apparent past ineffi-
ciency, won’t bid up prices until the undervaluation no longer
remains. Put another way, if these promoters of the pur-
ported new paradigms actually have been right in the past,
won’t they therefore be wrong in the future?
When active managers of equity funds claim to have a
way of uncovering extra value in our highly (but not per-
fectly) efficient U.S. stock market, investors will look at
their past record, consider the manager’s strategies, and in-
vest or not. These new index managers are in fact active
managers. But they not only claim prescience, but a pre-
science that gives them confidence that certain sectors of
the market (such as dividend-paying stocks) will remain un-
dervalued as far ahead as the eye can see.

[160] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING
I recommend skepticism. I have always been impressed
by the inexorable tendency for reversion to the mean in se-
curity returns. For example, mutual funds with a value man-
date have generally outperformed those with a growth
mandate since the late 1960s. But since 1977—indeed since
1937—there has been little to choose between the two. In
fact, from 1937 through 1967, growth mutual funds rather
consistently trumped value mutual funds. Never think you
know more than the market. Nobody does.
We never know when that reversion to the mean will
come to the various sectors of the stock market. But we
do know that such changes in style leadership have invari-
ably occurred in the past. With so much of the stock mar-
ket’s volatility based on expectations (emotions) rather
than business (economics), what else could we expect?
Before we too easily accept that fundamental indexing—
relying on style tilts toward dividends, value, or small-
ness—is the new paradigm, we need a longer sense of
history. We also need to call on our own common sense
that warns us that hindsight plays tricks on our minds.
There have been many new paradigms over the years.
None has persisted. The “concept” stocks of the Go-Go
years in the 1960s came and went. So did the “Nifty Fifty”
era that soon followed. The “January effect” of small-cap
superiority came and went. Option-income funds and “Gov-
ernment plus” funds came and went. In the late 1990s,

high-tech stocks and “new economy” funds came and went
as well. Today, the asset values of the survivors remain far
below their peaks. Intelligent investors should approach
with extreme caution a claim that any new paradigm is here
to stay. That’s not the way financial markets work.
(cid:2)
“The greatest enemy of a good plan is the dream
of a perfect plan.” Stick to the good plan.
Traditional all-market-cap-weighted index funds guar-
antee that you will receive your fair share of stock market
returns, and virtually assure that you will outperform, over
the long term, 90 percent or more of the other investors in
the marketplace. Maybe this new paradigm of fundamental
indexing—unlike all the other new paradigms I’ve seen—will
work. But maybe it won’t. I urge investors not to be
tempted by the siren song of paradigms that promise the ac-
cumulation of wealth that will be far beyond the rewards of
the classic index fund. Don’t forget the prophetic warning
of Carl von Clausewitz, military theorist and Prussian gen-
eral of the early nineteenth century, “The greatest enemy of
a good plan is the dream of a perfect plan.” Put your
dreaming away, pull out your common sense, and stick to
the good plan represented by the classic index fund.

Don’t Take My Word for It
While I feel strongly on this point, I am not alone.
First hear these words from Gregory Mankiw, Har-
vard professor and former chairman of the President’s
Council of Economic Advisers. “I am placing my
bets with Bogle on this one.” Then listen to William
Sharpe, professor of finance at Stanford and Nobel
Laureate in Economics: “It is quite remarkable that
people think that somehow a scheme that weights
stocks differently than capitalization can dominate a
capitalization-weighted index....New paradigms
come and go. Betting against the market (and spend-
ing a considerable amount of money to do so) is in-
deed likely to be a hazardous undertaking.”
Consider, too, this caution from John R. Mina-
han, director of research at New England Pension
Consultants: “I am amazed by all the managers that
make an assertion of the type: ‘In the long run X al-
ways wins,’ where X could be dividend yield, earnings
growth, quality of management, a quantitative factor
or mix of factors, etc.—yet are unable cite a reason
why X should be systematically underpriced by the
market. The managers may be able to point to data
suggesting that X has been associated with excess re-
turns in the past, but without a plausible explanation

of why X should outperform. Such data do not con-
vince me that X is likely to outperform in the future.”
Finally, consider this affirmation of classic index-
ing from Wharton School Professor Jeremy J.
Siegel,author of Stocks for the Long Runand adviser
to WisdomTree Investments, the promoter of the div-
idend-driven fundamental model. “It can be shown
that maximum diversification is achieved by holding
each stock in proportion to its value to the entire market
(italics added)....Hindsight plays tricks on our
minds...often distorts the past and encourages us to
play hunches and outguess other investors, who in
turn are playing the same game. For most of us, trying
to beat the market leads to disastrous results...our
actions lead to much lower returns than can be
achieved by just staying in the market...matching
the market year after year with index funds (such as)
the Vanguard 500 Portfolio...and Vanguard’s Total
Stock Market Index Fund.” (This quotation is from
the first edition of Dr. Siegel’s book in 1994. I un-
derstand that he has every right to change his mind.)

A Trader to the Cause

VENBEFORETHERISEof the so-called new paradigm of
fundamental indexing described in Chapter 14, traditional
indexing was being challenged by a sort of wolf-in-sheep’s
clothing, the exchange traded fund (ETF). Simply put,
the ETF is a fund designed to facilitate trading in its
shares, dressed in the guise of the traditional index fund.
If long-term investing was the original paradigm
for the classic index fund designed 31 years ago, surely
using index funds as trading vehicles can only be de-
scribed as short-term speculation. If the broadest pos-
sible diversification was the original paradigm, surely

holding discrete—even widely-diversified—sectors of
the market offers less diversification and commensu-
rately more risk. If the original paradigm was minimal
cost, then holding market sector index funds that
are themselves low-cost obviates neither the brokerage
commissions entailed in trading them nor the tax
burdens incurred if one has the good fortune to do so
successfully.

Typical ETF investors have absolutely no idea
what relationship their investment return will
have to the return earned by the stock market.
As to the quintessential aspect of the original para-

earn their fair share of the stock market’s return—the fact
is that investors who trade ETFs have nothing even re-
sembling such a guarantee. In fact, after all the selection
challenges, the timing risks, the extra costs, and the
added taxes—typical ETF investors have absolutely no
idea what relationship their investment return will have to
the return earned by the stock market.
These differences between the classic index fund and
the index fund nouveau represented by the ETF are stark

The first exchange traded fund, created in 1992 by
Nathan Most, was named “Standard & Poor’s Depositary
Receipts” (SPDRs), and quickly dubbed “Spider.” It was a
brilliant idea. Investing in the S&P 500 Index, operated at
low cost with high tax efficiency, and held for the long term,
it held the prospect of providing ferocious competition to
the traditional S&P 500 Index Fund. (Brokerage commis-
sions, however, made it less suitable for investors making
small investments regularly.) Most of the investors in the
Spiders, however, were not long-term investors. They were
active money managers, hedgers, and professional traders.
Currently, some 65 million (!) shares of Spiders ($8.8 billion
worth) are now traded every day.

THE EXCHANGE TRADED FUND [167]
From that single fund, ETFs have grown to be a huge
part—$410 billion—of the $1 trillion index fund asset base, a
41 percent share, up from just 9 percent as 2000 began and
only 3 percent a decade ago. Led by index portfolios whose
shares are rapidly traded in narrow market segments (de-
spite their stark contradiction of each of the five concepts
underlying the original index fund), ETFs have become a
force to be reckoned with in the financial markets. Their
amazing growth certainly says something about the energy of
Wall Street’s financial entrepreneurs, the focus of money
managers on gathering assets, the marketing power of bro-
kerage firms, and the willingness—nay, eagerness—of in-
vestors to favor complexity over simplicity, continuing to
believe, against all odds, that they can beat the market.
The growth of ETFs has approached a stampede, not
only in number but in diversity. There are now nearly 340
ETFs available, including 122 already formed during 2006,
and the range of the investment choices available is re-
markable.* There are 12 total stock market index funds
(U.S. and international) such as the Spider, still the largest
segment in terms of assets; 68 focused on investment
styles; 173 based on stock market sectors; and 58 concen-
trating their assets in particular foreign countries. There
*Early in 2007, 343 ETFs were on the drawing board, soon to be launched.
This stampede suggests a new investment fad. Such fads have rarely
enhanced the well-being of investors.

are also a handful of bond ETFs and a scattering of ETFs
utilizing high leverage (doubling the swings in the stock
market), tracking commodity prices and currencies, and
using other high-risk strategies.
The march of assets into ETFs has also been impres-
sive. Since 1999, ETFs have drawn $280 billion of net
new money, even larger than the $190 billion flowing into
their classic cousins. What’s more, the flow into style,
sector, and foreign funds has overwhelmed the flow into
the broad stock market index component. While these
broad funds accounted for 100 percent of the total ETF
inflow in the early years, they accounted for less than 20
percent from 2000 through 2006.

All-stock-market ETFs are the only instance in which
an ETF can replicate, and possibly even improve on, the
five paradigms of the original index fund listed earlier. But
only when they are bought and held for the long-term.
Their annual expense ratios are usually—but not always—
slightly lower than their mutual fund counterparts, although
commissions on purchases erode any advantage, and may
even overwhelm it. While their tax efficiency should be

higher, actual practice so far has failed to confirm theory,
and investors who trade them are subject to their own taxes.
Their use by long-term investors is minimal. The Spiders
are, in fact, marketed to day traders. As the advertisements
say, “Now you can trade the S&P 500 all day long, in real
time.”I can’t help likening the ETF—a cleverly designed fi-
nancial instrument—to the renowned Purdey shotgun, sup-
posedly the world’s best. It’s great for big-game hunting in
Africa. But it’s also excellent for suicide.
I suspect that too many ETFs will prove, if not suicidal
to their owners in financial terms, at least wealth-depleting.
We know that ETFs are largely used by traders, for the
turnover of Spider shares is running at 3600 percent annual
rate. The turnover for the NASDAQ Qubes is even higher,
at 6,000 percent per year. It is only guesswork, but long-
term investors hold perhaps 20 percent of the $100 billion
assets of these Spider-like broadly diversified ETFs, or
about $20 billion. The remaining assets, I presume, are
held by market makers and arbitrageurs, making heavy use
of short-selling and hedging strategies.
Assets of the other types of ETFs now total $310 billion.
Trading these funds is also remarkably high. The shares
of the major sector ETFs are typically turned over at an av-
erage annual rate of some 200 percent per year (an average
holding period of just six months), with the most popular
ETFs recently running turnover rates from 578 percent to

735 percent, all the way up to 7,100 percent (Russell 2000
iShares) and 8,500 percent (SPDR Energy shares). Could
there be speculation going on here? In all, some $390 billion
of the current $410 billion ETF base represents a vast depar-
ture from the beneficial attributes of the original index fund.
Yes, these specialized ETFs are diversified, but only in
their narrow arenas. Owning the semiconductor industry is
not diversification in any usual sense, nor is owning the
South Korean stock market. And while sector ETFs fre-
quently have the lowest expense ratios in their fields, they
can run three to six times the level of the lowest-cost all-
market index funds. What is more, sector ETFs not only
carry brokerage and trading costs, but often are sold as
parts of actively managed fund portfolios with adviser fees
of 1 percent or more, or in wrap accounts with annual fees
of 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent or more.
The net result of these differences is that sector
ETFs as a group are virtually certain to earn returns that
fall well short of the returns delivered by the stock mar-
ket. Perhaps 1 percent to 3 percent a year is a fair esti-
mate of these all-in costs, many times the 10 to 20
basis-point cost of the best classic index funds. It is not a
trivial difference. For no matter how often derided or ig-
nored, the tautology remains that sector funds, soundly
administered, will earn a net return equal to the gross re-
turn of that sector, less intermediation costs.

THE EXCHANGE TRADED FUND [171]
But whatever returns each sector ETF may earn, the
investors in those very ETFs will likely, if not certainly,
earn returns that fall well behind them. There is abundant
evidence that the most popular sector funds of the day are
those that have recently enjoyed the most spectacular re-
cent performance, and that such “after-the-fact” popular-
ity is a recipe for unsuccessful investing. The lesson in
Chapter 5—that mutual fund investors almost always do
significantly worse than the funds they own, and still
worse when they choose funds that are less diversified—is
likely to be repeated in ETFs.
To illustrate this point, consider the record of the 20
best performing ETFs during 2003–2006. Only one earned
a better return for its shareholders than the return it re-
ported. The average shortfall in shareholder return was
equal to 5 percentage points per year. The largest gap was
14 percentage points; iShares Austria reported a 42 percent
return, but its investors earned just 28 percent. “Handle
with Care” should be the first warning on the ETF label
(though I have yet to see it used). Or perhaps: “CAU-
TION: PERFORMANCE CHASING AT WORK.”

And so we have a “double whammy”: the near-
inevitability of counterproductive market timing (emo-
tions), as investors bet on sectors as they grow hot—
and bet against them when they grow cold—combined
with those heavy commissions and fees (expenses). To-
gether, these two enemies of the equity investor are
sure to be hazardous to your wealth, to say nothing of
consuming giant globs of your time that could easily be
used in more productive and enjoyable ways.
In 2006, ETFs were also at the cutting edge of the
“market-beating” (at least in retrospect) strategies described
earlier. These promoters and entrepreneurs seem to ac-
knowledge that their “fundamental indexing” approach is a
long-term strategy. Yet by choosing the ETF format, they
strongly imply that bringing stockbrokers into the distribu-
tion mix and actively buying and selling the funds will lead to
even larger short-term profits. I doubt it.
(cid:2)
ETFs are an entrepreneur’s dream come true.
But are they an investor’s dream come true?
ETFs are clearly a dream come true for entrepreneurs,
stock brokers, and fund managers. But is it too much to
ask whether these index funds nouveau are an investor’s
dream come true? Do investors really benefit from being
able to trade ETFs “all day long, in real time”? Is less
diversification better than more diversification? Is trend-

following a winner’s game, or a loser’s game? Are ETFs
truly low-cost when we add brokerage commissions to their
expense ratios? Is buy-and-sell (often with great frequency)
really a better strategy than buy-and-hold? If the classic
index fund was designed to capitalize on the wisdom of
long-term investing, aren’t investors in these index funds
nouveau too often engaging in the folly of short-term spec-
ulation? Doesn’t your own common sense give you the ob-
vious answers to these questions?
On the broad spectrum that lies between advancing
the interests of the business and the interests of the
clients, where do ETFs fit? If you are making a single
large initial purchase of either of those two versions of
classic indexing—the Spider or the Vanguard Total Stock
Market ETF—at a low commission rate and holding them
for the long term, you’ll profit from their low expense ra-
tios and may even enjoy a bit of extra tax efficiency. But if
you trade them, you’re defying the relentless rules of
humble arithmetic that are the key to successful investing.
If you like the idea of sector ETFs, use the appropriate
ones, don’t trade them, and use them in the right way—
sparingly, and only to diversify your portfolio.
Let me now answer the question I asked at the outset
of this chapter, “What have they done to my song, ma?”
As the creator of the world’s first index fund all those
years ago, I can only answer: “They’ve tied it up in a plas-
tic bag and turned it upside down, ma, that’s what they’ve

done to my song.” In short, the ETF is a trader to the
cause of classic indexing. I urge intelligent investors to
stay the course with the proven strategy. While I can’t say
that classic indexing is the best strategy ever devised,
your common sense should reassure you that the number
of strategies that are worse is infinite.
Don’t Take My Word for It
In an essay entitled “Indexing Goes Hollywood,”
here’s what Don Phillips, managing director of
Morningstar, has said: “[T]here is a dark side to in-
dexing that investors should not ignore. The poten-
tial for harm to investors increases as index offerings
become more specialized, which is exactly what has
happened in the world of ETFs....In the right
hands, precision tools can create great things; in the
wrong ones, however, they can do considerable
damage. In creating more complex offerings, the
index community has found new revenue sources
from...very specialized tools, but it has done so at
the risk of doing considerable harm to less sophisti-
cated investors. The test of character facing the
index community is whether it ignores that risk or
steps up and tries to mitigate it. The continued
good name of indexing lies in the balance.”

THE EXCHANGE TRADED FUND [175]
FromJim Wiandt, editor of the Journal of Indexes:
“I have always found it ironic that indexing—like
most everything else in the world of finance—comes
in waves. Hedge fund indexes, microcap indexes, div-
idend indexes, commodities indexes, China indexes
and ‘enhanced’ indexes are all flavors of the month.
And I’ll give you three guesses as to what all these in-
dexes have in common: (1) chasing returns, (2) chas-
ing returns, or (3) chasing returns.
“If you believe in indexing, then you know that
there is no free money. Ultimately, the push toward
enhanced indexing is about enhancing the bottom
line for managers....But it’s important for us to
keep our eyes on the ball and remember what makes
indexing, well, indexing. Low fees, broad diversifi-
cation, hold hold hold. Don’t believe the hype. Try
to beat the market—in any manner—and you’re
likely to get beat...by about the cost of doing it.”
And now listen carefully to the warnings from two
senior officers of a major ETF sponsor. Chief exec-
utive: “For most people, sector funds don’t make a
lot of sense...[don’t] stray too far from the market’s
course.” Chief investment officer:“It would be un-
fortunate if people focused pin-point bets on very
narrowly defined ETFs. These still involve nearly as
much risk as concentrating on individual stock
picks....You’re taking extraordinary risk. It’s possi-
ble to take a good thing too far....How many people
really need them?”

What Would Benjamin
Graham Have Thought
about Indexing?
(cid:2)
A Confirmation from Mr. Buffett
T
HEFIRSTEDITIONOFThe Intelligent Investorwas pub-
lished in 1949. It was written by Benjamin Graham, the
most respected money manager of the era, and coauthor
(with David Dodd) of Security Analysis, a scholarly tome
originally published in 1934. The Intelligent Investoris re-
garded as the best book of its kind—comprehensive, ana-
lytical, perceptive, and forthright—a book for the ages.
Although Benjamin Graham is best known by far for
his focus on the kind of value investing represented by the

category of stocks he describes as “bargain issues,” he
cautioned, “the aggressive investor must have a consider-
able knowledge of security values—enough, in fact, to
warrant viewing his security operations as equivalent to a
business enterprise. . . . It follows from this reasoning
that the majority of security owners should elect the de-
fensive classification.”
(cid:2)
The majority of investors should be
satisfied with the reasonably good return
obtainable from a defensive portfolio.
Why? Because “[the majority of investors] do not
have the time, or the determination, or the mental equip-
ment to embark upon such investing as a quasi-business.
They should therefore be satisfied with the reasonably
good return obtainable from a defensive portfolio, and
they should stoutly resist the recurrent temptation to in-
crease this return by deviating into other paths.” While
the index fund was not even imagined in 1949, he was cer-
tainly describing the very approach that this precedent-
setting fund would later follow. (Coincidently, it was also
in 1949 that an article in Fortune magazine introduced
me to the mutual fund industry, inspiring me to write my
1951 Princeton senior thesis on mutual funds, in which I

==================================================

[178] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING
even hinted at the index fund idea: “Mutual funds can
make no claim to superiority over the market averages.”)
For the defensive investor who required assistance, Gra-
ham originally recommended professional investment advis-
ers who rely on “normal investment experience for their
results...and who make no claim to being brilliant (but)
pride themselves on being careful, conservative, and compe-
tent...whose chief value to their clients is in shielding
them from costly mistakes.” He cautioned about expecting
too much from stock-exchange houses, arguing that “the
Wall Street business fraternity...is still feeling its way to-
ward the high standards and standing of a profession.” (A
half-century later, the quest remains far from complete.)
He also noted, profoundly if obviously, that Wall
Street is “in business to make commissions, and that the
way to succeed in business is to give customers what they
want, trying hard to make money in a field where they are
condemned almost by mathematical law to lose.” Later
on, in 1976, Graham described his opinion of Wall Street
as, “highly unfavorable . . . a Falstaffian joke that fre-
quently degenerates into a madhouse . . . a huge laundry
in which institutions take in large blocks of each other’s
washing.” (Shades of Harvard’s Jack Meyer and Yale’s
David Swensen, from whom we heard earlier.)
In that first edition of The Intelligent Investor, Gra-
ham commended the use by investors of leading investment



==================================================

==================================================

bogl_c16.qxd 2/8/07 11:00 AM Page 179
WHATWOULDGRAHAMHAVETHOUGHTABOUTINDEXING? [179]
funds as an alternative to creating their own portfolios.
Graham described the well-established mutual funds of his
era as “competently managed, making fewer mistakes than
the typical small investor,” carrying a reasonable expense,
and performing a sound function by acquiring and holding
an adequately diversified list of common stocks.
But he was bluntly realistic about what fund managers
might accomplish. He illustrated this point in his book
with data showing that from 1937 through 1947, when
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index provided a total return
of 57 percent, the average mutual fund produced a total
return of 54 percent, excluding the oppressive impact of
sales loads. (The more things change, the more they re-
main the same.) Graham’s conclusion: “The figures are
not very impressive in either direction . . . on the whole,
the managerial ability of invested funds has been just
about able to absorb the expense burden and the drag of
uninvested cash.” In 1949, fund expenses and turnover
costs were far lower than in the modern fund industry.
That change explains why, as fund returns were over-
whelmed by these costs in recent decades, the figures
were impressive only in a negative direction.
By 1965, Graham’s confidence that funds would
produce the market’s return, less costs, was somewhat
shaken. “Unsoundly managed funds,” he noted in a
later edition of The Intelligent Investor, “can produce

[180] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING
spectacular but largely illusionary profits for a while, fol-
lowed inevitably by calamitous losses.” He was describ-
ing the so-called performance funds of the mid-1960s
Go-Go era, in which a “new breed that had a spectacular
knack for coming up with winners . . . (managed by)
bright, energetic, young people who promised to per-
form miracles with other people’s money . . . (but) who
have inevitably brought losses to their public in the end.”
He could have as easily been presciently describing the
hundreds of risky “new economy” mutual funds formed
during the great bull market of 1998 to 2000, and their
utter collapse in the subsequent 50 percent market crash
that followed.
(cid:2)
“Unsoundly managed funds can produce
spectacular but largely illusionary profits for a
while, followed inevitably by calamitous losses.”
Graham also would have been appalled, not only by
the enormous (100 percent-plus) increase in those once-
reasonable fund expenses, but also by the incredible in-
crease in stock trading in mutual fund portfolios. During
Graham’s era, portfolio turnover ran to about 15 percent
per year. It now averages more than 100 percent. Gra-
ham would surely, and accurately, have described such an

approach as rank speculation that flies directly in the
face of his deeply held investment principles.
Graham’s timeless lesson for the intelligent investor,
as valid today as when he prescribed it in his first edition,
is clear: “the real money in investment will have to be
made—as most of it has been made in the past—not out of
buying and selling but of owning and holding securities,
receiving interest and dividends and increases in value.”
His philosophy has been reflected over and over again in
this book, exemplified in the parable of the Gotrocks fam-
ily in Chapter 1 and the distinction between the business
market and the expectations market in Chapter 2.
(cid:2)
The real money in investment will be made
not out of buying and selling but
of owning and holding securities.
Owning and holding a diversified list of securities?
Wouldn’t Graham recommend a fund that essentially
buys the entire stock market and holds it forever, pa-
tiently receiving interest and dividends and increases in
value? Doesn’t his admonition to “strictly adhere to
standard, conservative, and even unimaginative forms of
investment,” eerily echo the concept of market index-
ing? When he advises the defensive investor “to empha-
size diversification more than individual selection,”

[182] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING
hasn’t Benjamin Graham come within inches of describ-
ing the modern-day stock index fund?
Late in his life, in an interview published in 1976,
Graham candidly acknowledged the inevitable failure of
individual investment managers to outpace the market.
(Again coincidentally, the interview took place at the very
moment that the public offering of the world’s first mu-
tual index fund—First Index Investment Trust, now Van-
guard 500 Index Fund—was taking place.) He was asked,
“Can the average manager obtain better results than the
Standard & Poor’s Index over the years?” Graham’s
blunt response: “No.” Then he explained: “In effect that
would mean that the stock market experts as a whole
could beat themselves—a logical contradiction.”*
Then he was asked whether investors should be con-
tent with earning the market’s return. Graham’s answer:
“Yes.” All these years later, the idea that earning your fair
share of the stock market’s return is the winning strategy
is the central theme of this Little Book. Only the classic
index fund can guarantee that outcome.
Finally, he was asked about the objection made
against the index fund—that different investors have
*That is to say, there is no evidence that professional experts earn higher
returns than individual amateurs, nor that any class of institutional investor
(e.g., pension managers or mutual fund managers) earns more than any
other class.

different requirements. Again, Graham responded
bluntly: “At bottom that is only a convenient cliché or
alibi to justify the mediocre record of the past. All in-
vestors want good results from their investments, and
are entitled to them to the extent that they are actually
obtainable. I see no reason why they should be content
with results inferior to those of an indexed fund or pay
standard fees for such inferior results.”
(cid:2)
“I see no reason why investors should be content
with results inferior to those of an indexed fund.”
The name Benjamin Graham is intimately connected,
indeed almost synonymous, with “value investing” and the
search for undervalued securities. But his classic book
gives far more attention to the down-to-earth basics of
portfolio policy—the straightforward, uncomplicated prin-
ciples of diversification and rational long-term expecta-
tions, two of the overarching themes of the little book you
are now reading—than to solving the sphinxlike riddle of
selecting superior stocks through careful security analysis.
Graham was also well aware that the superior rewards he
had reaped using his valuation principles would be difficult
to achieve in the future. In that 1976 interview, he made this
remarkable concession, “I am no longer an advocate of elab-
orate techniques of security analysis in order to find superior

value opportunities. This was a rewarding activity, say, 40
years ago, but the situation has changed a great deal since
then. In the old days, any well-trained security analyst could
do a good professional job of selecting undervalued issues
through detailed studies; but in the light of the enormous
amount of research now being carried on, I doubt whether
in most cases such extensive efforts will generate sufficiently
superior selections to justify their cost.”
It is fair to say that, by Graham’s demanding standards,
the overwhelming majority of today’s mutual funds, largely
because of their high costs and speculative behavior, have
failed to live up to their promise. As a result, a new type of
fund—the index fund—is now gradually moving toward as-
cendancy. Why? Both because of what it does—providing
the broadest possible diversification—and because of what it
doesn’t do—neither assessing high costs nor engaging in
high turnover. These paraphrases of Graham’s copybook
maxims are an important part of his legacy to that vast ma-
jority of shareholders who, he believed, should follow the
principles he outlined for the defensive investor.
(cid:2)
“To achieve satisfactory investment results
is easier than most people realize.”
It is Benjamin Graham’s common sense, clear think-
ing, simplicity, and sense of financial history—along with

his willingness to hold fast to the sound principles of long-
term investing—that constitute his lasting legacy. He
sums up his advice: “Fortunately for the typical investor,
it is by no means necessary for his success that he bring
the time-honored qualities . . . of courage, knowledge,
judgment and experience . . . to bear upon his program—
provided he limits his ambition to his capacity and con-
fines his activities within the safe and narrow path of
standard, defensive investment. To achieve satisfactory in-
vestment results is easier than most people realize; to
achieve superior results is harder than it looks.”
When it’s so easy—in fact unbelievably simple—to
capture the stock market’s returns through an index fund,
you don’t need to take extra risks—and wasteful costs—in
striving for superior results. With Benjamin Graham’s
long perspective, common sense, hard realism, and wise
intellect, there is no doubt whatsoever in my mind that he
would have applauded the index fund.
Don’t Take My Word for It
While Benjamin Graham’s clearly written commen-
tary can easily be read as an endorsement of a low-
cost all-stock-market index fund, don’t take my
word for it. Listen instead to Warren Buffett, his

protégé and collaborator whose counsel and practi-
cal aid Graham acknowledged as invaluable in the
final edition of The Intelligent Investor. In 1993,
Buffett, unequivocally endorsed the index fund. In
2006, he went even further, not only reaffirming
this endorsement, but personally assuring me that,
decades earlier, Graham himself had endorsed index
funds. Hear Mr. Buffett: “A low-cost index fund is
the most sensible equity investment for the great
majority of investors. My mentor, Ben Graham
took this position many years ago and everything I
have seen since convinces me of its truth.” I can
only add, after Forrest Gump, “And that’s all I have
to say about that.”

To these independent experts add fund industry insid-
ers like Magellan’s Peter Lynch, former Investment Com-
pany Institute Chairman Jon Fossel, Philadelphia money
manager Ted Aronson, hedge fund manager Cliff Asness,
fund supermarket king Charles Schwab, and analyst
Mark Hulbert. Then heed the similar advice of financial
journalists, from Tyler Mathisen and Jason Zweig of
Money magazine, to the Economist of London and its
neighbor The Spectator; and Jonathan Clements and
Holman Jenkins, Jr., of the Wall Street Journal. Perhaps
even more important, don’t forget the convictions of in-
telligent investors—hundreds of corporate and govern-
ment pension funds and millions of individuals, from the
very wealthy to the man on the street—who have put their
money where their mouth is, now investing some $5 tril-
lion in index strategies.
That confidence is further buttressed by simply look-
ing at the record, as discussed in chapter after chapter.
That record confirms the superiority of indexing—by a
wide margin—over the average stock fund (and the aver-
age bond fund as well) and—by an even wider margin—
over the average fund investor. Further, the superiority of
the index fund is based, not on the fleeting accomplish-
ments of a tiny handful of funds (often achieved by money
managers who had ceased managing the funds’ portfolios
years earlier), but on the permanent accomplishments of

an all-market strategy where no money manager even en-
ters the picture. Truly, the classic index fund is the only
mutual fund you can hold forever.
As John Maynard Keynes warned earlier in a different
context, historical returns are of no value unless we can
explain the source of those returns. In this context, let me
reiterate the two basic sources of the superior returns
achieved by the index fund: (1) the broadest possible di-
versification, eliminating individual stock risk, style risk,
and manager risk, with only market risk remaining; and
(2) the tiniest possible costs and minimal taxes. Together,
they enable the index fund to provide the gross return
earned in the stock market, minus a scintilla of cost.
(cid:2)
The two sources of the superior returns of the
index fund: (1) the broadest possible
diversification; and (2) the tiniest possible costs.
Actively managed equity mutual funds as a group also
provide, as common sense tells you, a gross return equal
to the average return of the market. Today, holding al-
most 25 percent of all U.S. stocks, they trade largely
with one another, enriching on balance only the brokers
who receive the commissions on their vigorous trading of
portfolio securities (and who also happen to sell their

shares) and the management companies that control
them, as a result impoverishing, as it were, the net returns
that the funds deliver to their investors.
Fund investment managers, distributors, marketers,
administrators, brokers, and investment bankers have gar-
nered staggering rewards for themselves. But the high
prices they charge for their services, their high turnover
policies and the attendant transaction costs, and the exces-
sive taxes that their investors incur have siphoned off an
enormous portion of the high real returns provided by the
stock market in the past. With the subdued real returns on
stocks that seem almost destined to prevail in the future
(discussed in Chapter 7), those same huge rewards to those
in the fund business will confiscate an even larger share—
indeed, the lion’s share—of the stock market’s real return.
On the one hand, it is as certain as the rising and set-
ting of the sun that the large cost advantage that exists for
the index fund will continue in the years ahead. Price
competition among index funds will keep the expense ra-
tios of the low-cost providers at a minuscule level. On the
other hand, marketing competition and the drive for prof-
its among the giant financial conglomerates that hold do-
minion over the fund industry will create strong pressure
to maintain the high fee revenues generated by their ac-
tively managed funds where, tragically, investors too often
ignore the impact of the baneful fees that they pay.

“THE RELENTLESS RULES OF HUMBLE ARITHMETIC” [191]
It is at least theoretically possible that the fund industry
will at last turn from its present competition to raise prices
in order to serve the interest of fund sellers, to a new compe-
tition to cut prices and serve the interest of fund buyers. But
it’s impossible to imagine that the huge gap between the all-
in costs of the index fund and the all-in costs of the average
equity fund—a gap that has now reached some 2.5 percent-
age points per year—will be significantly reduced. And even
if the gap were slashed by one-half—which will only happen
(to use a wonderful barnyard metaphor for the inconceivable)
when pigs finally whistle—the classic index fund would re-
main the investment of choice.
There’s also no guarantee that fund investors will con-
tinue to suffer that additional loss of the 3 percentage
points per year of return that they have incurred in the past
through the twin penalties of market timing and fund selec-
tion. If investors, however, finally realize the error of their
ways, the negative impact of their counterproductive emo-
tions could be substantially reduced in the years ahead. At
some point, after all, smart investors ought to figure out
for themselves that pouring money into hot funds in hot
markets, and pulling money out of those funds when they
turn cool, often in cold markets, is a loser’s game.
On the other hand, with the craze in trading ETFs, the
gap could get even larger. Whatever the case, it seems set
in stone that a substantial gap between the return earned by

[192] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING
fund investors and the returns reported by the funds them-
selves will continue to exist. If you expect a substantial re-
versal of that trend, I would simply warn: don’t count on it.
But above all, I’m confident about the long-term suc-
cess that lies in store for sound investment in business
through the classic index fund and those who invest in it,
because virtually the entire case that I present is based on
“the relentless rules of humble arithmetic.” Lest we forget,
let me again take you through these commonsense rules:
1. Over the long term, stock market returns are cre-
ated by real investment returns earned by real busi-
nesses—the annual dividend yield on publicly held
U.S. corporations, plus their subsequent rate of
earnings growth.
2. Over the short run, illusory speculative returns,
caused by the impact of the change in the amount
investors are willing to pay for each dollar of corpo-
rate earnings, can increase or decrease investment
returns. But in the long run, the impact of specula-
tive return washes out.
QQEEDD 11:: In investing, the winning strategy for
reaping the rewards of capitalism depends on own-
ing businesses, not trading stocks.
3. Individual businesses come and go. Given the rapid
pace of technological change we face today, along

“THE RELENTLESS RULES OF HUMBLE ARITHMETIC” [193]
with powerful new global competition, the failure
rate of individual corporations is hardly likely to
falter and may well increase.
The best protection for individual investors
from the risks inherent in individual stocks is the
broadest possible diversification.
QQEEDD 22:: Owning businesss in the aggregate
through an all-market index fund is the consum-
mate risk-reduction strategy. (Broad economic
risks to corporate earnings and dividends, however,
cannot be diversified away.)
4. As a group, all investors in the stock market earn
its gross returns. When the market provides an 8
percent return, investors divide up 8 percent
(before taking account of costs). What else is new?
5. While investors earn the market’s entire return,
they do not capture the market’s entire return.
Rather, they capture the market’s return only after
the costs of financial intermediation are deducted—
commissions, management fees, marketing costs,
sales loads, administrative expenses, legal expenses
and custodial fees, and so on. Unnecessary taxes
simply enlarge the gap.
QQEEDD 33:: Gross market return, minus costs,
equals net return for investors as a group. (Again,
remember the Gotrocks family.)

QQEEDD 44:: Gross market return, minus costs,
minus timing and selection penalties, equals the net

Let me remind you again of the “4 Es” that you
read about in Chapter 5: The two greatest enemies of
the equity fund investor are expenses and emotions. In
that context, the index fund is the investment of choice
because all the other choices have serious problems.
These problems begin with the grossly excessive costs
that overwhelm the ability of all but the ablest (or luck-
iest) fund managers to outpace the index fund. But they
don’t end there, for the mutual fund industry has cre-
ated for itself other problems that are wholly counter-
productive to the interests of the investors that it seeks
to serve.
(cid:2)
Common sense suggests
that fund owners should control their funds.

==================================================

“THE RELENTLESS RULES OF HUMBLE ARITHMETIC” [195]
These problems include:
• The industry’s very structure, in which managers
control the funds that they serve under contract.
Mutual funds themselves are required under the
law to be governed by a board of directors that in-
cludes a majority of independent members who are
unaffiliated with the management company. While
common sense would suggest that the owners of
the fund should be in the driver’s seat of fund op-
erations, they have been consigned to the rumble
seat, essentially powerless and voiceless.
• The overriding drive among fund managers is for
asset size, seemingly above all else, simply because
piling assets on assets results in fees piled on fees.
Yet the record shows that when small and midsize
funds capitalize on their flexibility and succeed in
generating exceptional returns, they draw immense
cash flows and become giant funds that are muscle-
bound and inflexible, limited to a return that paral-
lels the stock market (before costs)—pinned to the
earth, as it were, like Gulliver.
• The worship of the Great God Market Share,
which demands aggressive and costly marketing,
promotional, and advertising efforts not only to
build existing funds (easiest to do with those funds
that have provided superior returns in the past), but

[196] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING
to bring out new funds with each change in the mar-
ket environment. And so we had “Go-Go” funds in
the 1960s; “Nifty Fifty” (proven growth stocks)
funds in the 1970s; “Government-Plus” funds in the
1980s; and “New Economy” funds (notably in tech-
nology, telecommunications, or internet stocks) in
the late 1990s. Today, the popular favorites include
real estate funds, emerging market funds, and com-
modity funds. And we’ve added a whole new fillip:
the ability to trade these funds “all day long, in real
time” via the increasingly popular ETFs.
No business can forever ignore the interest of its
clients. The fund industry could do so during the 1980s
and 1990s only because it was blessed with the powerful
tailwind of financial markets that provided the highest re-
turns in all history—18 percent from stocks, 80 percent
above the long-term average of 10 percent; 10 percent
from bonds, 100 percent above the long-term average of
5 percent. But while investors seemed willing to accept
the loss of a few percentage points from those enormous
returns (if they were even aware of the impact of those all-
in costs), they surely will not accept such a loss in the en-
vironment of sharply lower returns on stocks and bonds
alike that seem certain in the years ahead. And as in-
vestors come to rely on a measurement benchmark based
not on nominal returns, but on real returns, they will be

even more skeptical about the ability of the fund industry
to serve their interests.
(cid:2)
No business can forever ignore
the interest of its clients.
The fund industry, finally, will be hoist on its own
petard—an explosion created by the lethal mix of a flawed
governance structure with a failed industry mission. Its
unremitting aim to build enormous assets through oppor-
tunistic marketing and “new product” adventurism, all
lumped on top of costs that cannot possibly be recouped
by superior performance. In a brutish world peopled by
smart, educated, experienced, and professional money
managers who are competing with one another, managers
as a group are inevitably consigned to average returns be-
fore costs; and after costs are deducted, they are destined
to be losers. The arithmetic is unarguable.
“Remember, O Stranger, arithmetic is the first of the
sciences.” The mutual fund industry has forgotten that sim-
ple rule. Unless it changes, the industry will begin a long de-
cline, condemned to its fate by its willingness, even its
eagerness, to ignore the relentless rules of humble arith-
metic. As more and more investors come to recognize the
simple commonsense truth of these humble realities, the
passively managed index fund is destined to become an even
more formidable competitor to its actively managed rivals.

Don’t Take My Word for It
Listen first to David Swensen, chief investment offi-
cer of Yale University, “Invest in low-turnover, pas-
sively managed index funds...and stay away from
profit-driven investment management organizations...
The mutual fund industry is a colossal failure...re-
sulting from its systematic exploitation of individual
investors...as funds extract enormous sums from in-
vestors in exchange for providing a shocking disserv-
ice....Excessive management fees take their toll, and
(manager) profits dominate fiduciary responsibility.”
Then listen to Holman Jenkins, Jr., of the Wall
Street Journal, “Will customers keep supporting the
enormous overhead required to sustain ineffectual,
unproductive stock picking across an array of thou-
sands of individual funds devoted to every investing
‘style’ and economic sector or regional subgroup that
some marketing idiot can dream up? Not likely. A
brutal shakeout is coming and one of its revelations
will be that stock picking is a grossly overrated piece
of the puzzle, that cost control is what distinguishes a
competitive firm from an uncompetitive one.”
Then listen to Nobel Laureate in Economics
and Princeton professor Daniel Kahneman. His
life’s work explains that investors are prone to over-
confidence, and that overconfidence causes us to
misinterpret information and let our emotions warp
our judgment. When it comes to investing, “I don’t

try to be clever at all. The idea that I could see what
no one else can is an illusion.” So he sticks with,
yes, index funds.
But for simple prose, hear this unmistakable en-
dorsement from Warren Buffett:“By periodically in-
vesting in an index fund, the know-nothing investor
can actually out-perform most investment profession-
als. Paradoxically, when ‘dumb’ money acknowledges
its limitations, it ceases to be dumb....Those index
funds that are very low cost...are investor-friendly
by definition and are the best selection for most of
those who wish to own equities.”

EEP DOWN, I REMAIN absolutely confident that the
vast majority of American families will be well served by
owning their equity holdings in an all-U.S. stock-market
index portfolio and holding their bonds in an all-U.S.
bond-market index portfolio. (Investors in high tax brack-
ets, however, would hold a very low-cost quasi-index port-
folio of high-grade intermediate-term municipal bonds.)
While such an index-driven strategy may not be the best
investment strategy ever devised, the number of invest-
ment strategies that are worse is infinite. The rationale
for a 100-percent-index-fund portfolio remains as solid as
a rock. It’s all about common sense.

WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW? [201]
(cid:2)
While an index-driven strategy may not be the
best investment strategy ever devised, the number
of investment strategies that are worse is infinite.
But I also fear, again deep down, that very few in-
vestors will follow that approach—the essence of simplic-
ity—for their entire investment portfolio. You must now be
as exhausted as I am by the unremitting pounding of my
theme that simplicity is the answer and that complexity
simply doesn’t work. But we investors seem all-too-willing
to ignore the verities described in this book. Instead of
index funds, we opt for costly active funds and trade them
to excess. Why? We are sold funds more often than we
buy them. We have far too much self-confidence. We
crave excitement. We succumb to the distraction that is
the stock market. We fail to understand the arithmetic of
investing, and the arithmetic of mutual funds.
I cannot tell you whether betting on a particular man-
ager who pursues an active investment strategy will win or
lose in the future. But I can guarantee that it hasn’t worked
very well in the past. To be sure, there are lots of smart, en-
gaging, purposeful money managers and financial advisers.
And all of the activity that seems endemic to the investment
business can be exciting and enticing. But after all is said
and done, there are no surefire solutions for investment suc-

cess—wealth without risk, if you will. It’s just not a realistic
expectation. Nonetheless, building an investment portfolio
can be exciting, and trying out modern remedies for age-old
problems lets you exercise your animal spirits. If you crave
excitement, I would encourage you to do exactly that. Life is
short. If you want to enjoy the fun, enjoy! But not with one
penny more than 5 percent of your investment assets.
That can be your Funny Money account. But at least
95 percent of your investments should be in your Serious
Money account. That core of your program should consist
of at least 50 percent in index funds, up to 100 percent.
What about your Funny Money account? Enjoy the fun of
gambling and the thrill of the chase, but not with your rent
money and certainly not with college education funds for
your children, nor with your retirement nest egg. Test, if
you will, two or three aggressive investment strategies.
You’re likely to learn some valuable lessons, and it probably
won’t hurt you too much in the short term. Here are seven
Funny Money approaches, and my advice about using them:
1. Individual stocks? Yes. Pick a few. Listen to the
promoters. Listen to your broker or adviser. Listen
to your neighbors. Heck, even listen to your
brother-in-law.
2. Actively managed mutual funds? Yes. But only if
they are run by managers who own their own firms,

who follow distinctive philosophies, and who invest
for the long term, without benchmark hugging.
(Don’t be disappointed if the managed fund loses to
the index fund in at least one year of every three!)
3. “Closet index” funds whose returns are tied closely
to the returns of the stock market and that carry
excessive costs? No.
4. Exchange traded funds? Those that track defined
industry sectors that exclude the field in which the
family breadwinner earns his or her living? Maybe.
Those that hold the classic index portfolio? Yes.
But in the Serious Money account. Whatever the
case, don’t speculate in ETFs. Invest in them.
5. Commodity funds? No. Of course, there will be
commodity bubbles that will attract you only after
they have inflated to absurd proportions. But unlike
stocks and bonds, commodities have no fundamen-
tals to support them (neither earnings and divi-
dends nor interest payments).
6. Hedge funds? No. Too much hype. Too much dif-
fusion of performance among winners and losers.
Too many different strategies. Too many successful
managers who won’t accept your money. Too much
cost and too little tax efficiency. The management
fees are so high that they often destroy even the
small chance you have of winning. (The hedge

compensation strategy.)

hedge fund is too expensive, just imagine a fund of
hedge funds that lays on another whole layer of

In your Serious Money Account,
50 percent to 95 percent in classic index
funds. In your Funny Money Account,
not one penny more than 5 percent.
If you decide to have a Funny Money Account, be sure
to measure your returns after one year, after five years, and
after ten years. Then compare those returns with the re-
turns you’ve earned in your Serious Money Account. I’m
betting that your Serious Money will win in a landslide. If it
does, you can then decide whether all that fun was adequate
compensation for the potential wealth you’ve relinquished.
Fun, finally, may be a fair enough purpose for your
Funny Money account. But how, you ask, should you invest
your Serious Money Account—that 50 percent to 95 per-
cent of your assets which you now depend on, or will one
day depend on, for retirement? Use an index fund strategy.
Even better, use it for 100 percent of your assets.

WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW? [205]
The fact that few of you are likely to go that far
doesn’t mean it isn’t the best strategy. Here, listen to
Warren Buffett: “Most investors, both institutional and
individual, will find that the best way to own common
stocks is through an index fund that charges minimal fees.
Those following this path are sure to beat the net results
(after fees and expenses) delivered by the great majority
of investment professionals.” (Don’t forget that indexing
is also, for most investors, the best way to own bonds.)

Reasonable alternative strategies for
supplementing the index funds
in your Serious Money portfolio.
While I favor the pristine and classic all-U.S.-stock-
market and all-bond-market approach, there are perfectly
reasonable alternative strategies for supplementing the
index funds in your Serious Money portfolio. Kept within
limits, here are some acceptable variations:*
• An international flavor: While international busi-
nesses comprise more than 30 percent of the rev-
enues and profits of U.S. corporations, many
*Because of space limitations, I deal with each strategy in a cursory man-
ner here. But further study on your part will be rewarded.

[206] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING
investors seek a larger global participation. Al-
though foreign stocks account for about one-half
of the world’s market capitalization, I recommend
that they account for no more than about 20 per-
cent of your own equity portfolio. By far the
soundest way to acquire that participation is to
hold (no surprise here!) a low-cost total interna-
tional index fund that tracks the returns of all non-
U.S. corporations. A modest holding in a low-cost
emerging market index fund is also a reasonable
approach, but be sure you understand the risks.
• Slice-and-dice:Impressed both by the long-term per-
formance (and recent performance) of value stocks
and small-cap stocks, some investors hold the all-
market (or S&P 500) index fund as the core, and
add a value index fund and a small-cap index fund as
satellites. I’m skeptical that any kind of superior per-
formance will endure forever. (Nothing does!) But if
you disagree, it would not be unreasonable to hold,
say, 85 percent in the core, another 10 percent in
value, and another 5 percent in small-cap. But doing
so increases the risk that your return will fall short of
the market’s return, so don’t push too far.
• Bond strategy: The all-U.S.-bond-market portfolio
remains the bond investment of choice. It holds in-
vestment-grade corporate bonds, mortgage-backed

securities, and U.S. Treasurys, and has an interme-
diate-term maturity in the range of 5 to 10 years.
Yet we all differ in our liquidity preferences, in-
come requirements, and tolerance for volatility.
Combining a mix of index funds linked to short-
term, intermediate-term, and long-term bonds in
varying amounts is a sound way of honoring these
preferences. I don’t recommend money market
funds in this mix (they are for savings, not for in-
vestment), but rather favor short-term bond funds
for investors who lean toward greater short-term
stability of principal and in return are willing to ac-
cept less durability of income over the long term.
• Inflation protection: Inflation-linked bonds provide
excellent protection against the long-term erosion
of the purchasing power of the dollar, particularly in
tax-deferred accounts. The U.S. Treasury offers
these bonds in various maturities, which pays a
basic interest rate (currently about 2.4 percent on
the 10-year Treasury note) and is adjusted for infla-
tion (currently expected to be about 2.3 percent).
This all-in yield totals 4.7 percent, the same as the
regular 10-year Treasury. The difference is that if
inflation rises (or for that matter, falls), the total re-
turn that you earn will reflect the change. Since the
value of Treasury note at maturity is deemed risk-

free, there is no need for the diversification of an
index fund. If you prefer a bond fund owning infla-
tion-linked bonds, choose only the lowest-cost funds
(in effect, an index strategy).
• Asset allocation: How much in stocks? How much
in bonds? Asset allocation is almost universally con-
sidered the most important determinant of your
long-term investment return. Most of us will want
more stocks when we’re young, have relatively small
assets at stake, many years to recoup losses, and do
not depend on investment income. When we’re
older, we’re likely to prefer more bonds. If we’ve
planned intelligently and invested wisely, our asset
accumulations have grown to substantial size; we
have far less time on our side; and when we have re-
tired we will rely on our portfolios to produce a
steadyandcontinuingstreamofincome.Myfavorite
rule of thumb is (roughly) to hold a bond position
equal to your age—20 percent when you are 20, 70
percent when you’re 70, and so on—or maybe even
your age minus 10 percent. There are no hard-and-
fast rules here. (Most experts think my guidelines
are too conservative. But I am conservative.)
• Balanced index funds: Since the formation of the
first balanced index fund in 1990 (60 percent total
U.S. stock market, 40 percent total U.S. bond

market), many variations on that theme have been
created. First came Life Strategy Funds, each with
a fixed allocation ranging from roughly 20 percent
to 80 percent in stocks (often with a moderate in-
ternational allocation), and the remainder in U.S.
bonds. More recently, Target Funds have come to
the fore. Here, investors can begin with an alloca-
tion appropriate to their age, which inches gradu-
ally toward a more conservative allocation as they
approach the retirement age they have targeted.
Such gradual rebalancing makes considerable
sense.Essentially,yourallocationstrategyisonau-
tomatic pilot for your lifetime. The most effective
way to implement this strategy is through target
funds investing in stock and bond index funds.
Such a strategy is likely to be carefree (even bor-
ing),justasitislikelytobeenormouslyproductive.
The low-cost index fund is especially important
today in your asset allocation strategy. With the eq-
uity premium—the spread between the prospective
stock return (about 7 percent per year) and prospec-
tive return on the U.S. 10-year Treasury Bond (now
less than 5 percent)—at only about 2 percent, you can
eat your cake and have it too. For index funds can de-
liver virtually that entire premium to investors. In
contrast, even costs as low as 2 percent per year for

[210] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING
an actively managed equity fund would erase the en-
tire premium. Under these circumstances, for exam-
ple, a fund investor with 75 percent stocks in an
active equity fund and 25 percent in bonds would
earn a net annual return of 5 percent per year. But an
investor in a passive equity fund, pursuing a far more
conservative 50/50 strategy, would earn 6 percent.
Twenty percent more return with 33 percent less risk
would seem to be an offer that’s too good to refuse.

For all the inevitable uncertainty amidst the
eternally dense fog surrounding the world of
investing, there remains much that we do know.
As you seek investment success, realize that it’s never
given to us to know what the returns stocks and bonds
will deliver in the years ahead, nor the future returns that
might be achieved by alternatives to the index portfolio.
But take heart. For all the inevitable uncertainty amidst
the eternally dense fog surrounding the world of invest-
ing, there remains much that we do know. Just consider
these commonsense realities:
• We knowthat we must start to invest at the earliest
possible moment, and continue to put money away
regularly from then on.

• We know that investing entails risk. But we also
knowthatnotinvestingdoomsustofinancialfailure.
• We know the sources of returns in the stock and
bond markets, and that’s the beginning of wisdom.
• We know that the risk of selecting specific securi-
ties, as well as the risk of selecting both managers
and investment styles, can be eliminated by the
total diversification offered by the classic index
fund. Only market risk remains.
• We know that costs matter, overpoweringly in the
long run, and we know that we must minimize
them. (We also know that taxes matter, and that
they, too, must be minimized.)
• We know that neither beating the market nor suc-
cessfully timing the market can be generalized
without self-contradiction. What may work for the
few cannot work for the many.
• We know that alternative asset classes such as
hedge funds aren’t really alternative, but simply
pools of capital that invest—or overinvest or disin-
vest—in the very stocks and bonds that comprise
the portfolio of the typical investor.
• Finally, we know what we don’t know. We can
never be certain how our world will look tomorrow,
and we know far less about how it will look a
decade hence. But with intelligent asset allocation

and sensible investment selections, you will be pre-
pared for the inevitable bumps along the road and
should glide right through them.
Our task remains: earning our fair share of whatever re-
turns that our business enterprises are generous enough to
provide in the years to come. That, to me, is the definition
of investment success. The classic index fund is the only in-
vestment that guarantees the achievement of that goal.
Don’t count yourself among the losers who will fail to out-
pace the stock market. You will be a winner if you follow the
simple commonsense guidelines in this Little Book.
Don’t Take My Word for It
The ideas in this closing chapter seem like common
sense to me, and perhaps they seem like common
sense to you as well. But if you have any doubt, listen
to their echo in these words by Clifford S. Asness,
managing principal of AQR Capital Management.
“We basically know how to invest. A good analogy is
to dieting and diet books. We all know how to lose
weight and get in better shape: Eat less and exercise
more...that is simple—but it is not easy.Investing is
no different....Some simple, but not easy, advice for
good investing and financial planning in general in-
cludes: diversify widely...keep costs low...rebal-
ance in a disciplined fashion...spend less...save

more...make less heroic assumptions about future
returns...when something sounds like a free lunch,
assume it is not free unless very convincing arguments
are made—and then check again...stop watching
the stock markets...work less on investing, not
more....In true Hippocratic fashion: Do No
Harm! You do not need a magic bullet. Little can
change the fact that current expected returns on a
broad set of asset classes are low versus history. Stick to
the basics with discipline.”
The wisdom of Cliff Asness is in fact age-old. Con-
sider these thoughts from Benjamin Franklin, the mas-
ter of common sense and simplicity. “If you would be
wealthy, think of Saving as well as Getting....Re-
member that time is money....Beware of little Ex-
penses; a small Leak will sink a great Ship....There
are no Gains, without Pains....He that would catch
Fish, must venture his Bait....Great Estates may ven-
ture more, but little Boats should keep near
shore....Tis easy to see, hard to foresee....Industry,
Perseverance, and Frugality make Fortune yield.”
The simple ideas in this chapter really work. A few
years ago, I received this letter from a Vanguard
shareholder holding our 500 Index Fund and Total
Stock Market Index Fund, several of our managed
equity funds and taxable and tax-exempt bond
funds, and a diversified list of individual stocks.

As a dyed-in-the-wool indexer, of course, I believe
the classic index fund must be the core of that winning
strategy. But even I would never have had the temerity
to say what Dr. Paul Samuelson of M.I.T.said in a
speech to the Boston Society of Security Analysts
in the autumn of 2005: “The creation of the first
index fund by John Bogle was the equivalent of the in-
vention of the wheel and the alphabet.”Those two es-
sentials of our existence that we take for granted
every day have stood the test of time. So will the
classic index fund.

Acknowledgments
I
N WRITING THIS BOOK, I have received incredibly
wonderful support from the entire (three-person) staff of
Bogle Financial Markets Research Center, the Vanguard-
supported unit that began its formal activities at the
beginning of 2000.
I want to express special thanks to Assistant to the
President Kevin P. Laughlin, who joined me in 1999 and
is among the longest-serving of the 13 assistants who have
worked with me over the years, going all the way back to
1960. Kevin has done just about everything but actually
write this book—researching subjects, developing data,
checking sources, helping to edit the text, working with
the publisher. He has done it not only with excellence but
with a patience and equanimity that have to be seen to be
believed.
Emily Snyder, my executive assistant for 17 years now
(and with 22 years of service on the Vanguard crew), has

also been an enormous help, with extraordinary skill,
steadfast finesse, and unfailing good humor. While I
think she winced when I told her that, yes, I’d be writing
my sixth book (and only a few short months after the pub-
lication of number five, The Battle for the Soul of Capi-
talism), she has turned my scrawled writing on piles of
legal pages into a beautifully rendered typescript, and she
patiently carried me through the usual eight or so edits
that I can’t help myself from doing—all in the pursuit of a
clear, accurate, logical, and reader-friendly text.
While Sara Hoffman is new to our little group, she,
too, did her share of endless typing and retyping, adjust-
ing the rhythm of my writing to the frantic pace of our ac-
tivity, also with skill, patience, and good humor.
I should note that I take full responsibility for the
strong opinions expressed in this Little Book. These
opinions do not necessarily represent the opinions of the
present management of Vanguard. I remain deeply dedi-
cated to Vanguard and its crew members, and continue to
“press on, regardless” in the furtherance of the values
that I invested in the firm when I founded it in 1974, and
during the 25 years in which I served as chief executive,
then chairman, and then senior chairman.
