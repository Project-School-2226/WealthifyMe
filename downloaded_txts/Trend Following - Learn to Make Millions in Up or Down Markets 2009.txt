“Conventional wisdom says buy low and sell high, but what do you do now
that your favorite market—be it a stock, bond, or commodity—is at an all-time
high or low? For a completely different perspective, from people who actually
make money at this business, take a look inside. Michael Covel has written a
timely and entertaining account of trend following—how it works, how to do it,
and who can do it. While it’s not for everybody, it might be for you.”
—Charles Faulkner, NLP modeler and trading coach, featured in
numerous books including The New Market Wizards
“I think the book did a superb job of covering the philosophy and thinking
behind trend following (basically, why it works). You might call it the Market
Wizards of Trend Following.”
—Van K. Tharp, Ph.D., president, International Institute of Trading
Mastery, Inc. Van was originally profiled in The Market Wizards
by Jack Schwager.
“I think that this book documents a great deal of what has made trend
following managers a successful part of the money management landscape
(how they manage risk and investment psychology). It serves as a strong
educational justification on why investors should consider using trend
following managers as a part of an overall portfolio strategy.”
—Tom Basso, retired CEO, Trendstat Capital Management, Inc.
Tom was originally profiled in The New Market Wizards
by Jack Schwager.

thoughts and quotes of successful traders, investors and society’s leaders.
This is a valuable contribution and some of the best writing on trend following

for me of two important, intertwined investment themes: trend

we went to school. They don’t care if you’re short or tall. I was never
very good in school and I wasn’t a good athlete either. With my
background, the way I saw it, I never had any problem with the idea
that I could be wrong. So, I have always built in an assumption of
wrongness to anything that I do. We now kindly refer to this
practice as risk management, but I just wanted to answer the
question: “What’s the worst thing that could happen to me?” I never
wanted to do anything that could kill me. Knowing that I was not
likely to be right that often, I had to trade in a way that would make
me a lot of money when I was right and not lose me a lot of money
when I was wrong. If that wasn’t enough, it also had to be simple
enough for me to understand.
After many years of searching and learning things the hard way,
I evolved my own version of trend following. The idea made sense
and I had some good examples to follow. Still, I wanted to prove to
myself that it worked without betting real money. I had to test what
would have happened had I traded that way in the past. These were
the early days of computers and we even had to “borrow” time on
university computers to test and prove our theories. It was a
painstaking task, but it gave me the comfort that I needed. Now, in
reading Trend Following, the do-it-yourselfers might argue that
having a book that illustrates these same basic principles takes
some of the fun out of it.
Actually, Covel, like any good trend follower, has not focused
solely on the endpoint. He gives you a deep understanding of the
most important part: the path. Unlike so many other books that

investing, and all other types of fundamental analysis, but lacking
any resource or, for that matter, practically any reference to what I
believe is the single best strategy to consistently make money in the
markets. That strategy is known as trend following. Author Van
Tharp has described it succinctly:
“Let’s break down the term ‘trend following’ into its com-
ponents. The first part is ‘trend.’ Every trader needs a
trend to make money. If you think about it, no matter
what the technique, if there is not a trend after you buy,
then you will not be able to sell at higher prices … ‘follow-
ing’ is the next part of the term. We use this word because
trend followers always wait for the trend to shift first, then
‘follow’ it.”2
Trend following trading seeks to capture the majority of a
market trend, up or down, for profit. It aims for profits in all major
asset classes—stocks, bonds, currencies, and commodities. Unfor-
tunately, however simple the basic concepts about trend following
are, they have been widely misunderstood by the public. My desire
to correct this state of affairs is what, in part, launched my research.

I wanted to be as objective as possible, so I based my writing on all
available data:
• Trend followers’ month-by-month performance histories
• Trend followers’ published words and comments over the last
30 years
• News accounts of financial disasters
• News accounts of the losers in those financial disasters
• Charts of markets traded by trend followers
• Charts of markets traded by losers in the financial disasters

However, unlike Collins who was writing about generally well
known public companies, trend followers form a sort of under-
ground network of relatively unknown traders who, except for an
occasional article, the mainstream press has virtually ignored. What
I have attempted to do is lift the veil, for the first time, on who these
enormously successful traders are, how they trade, and what is to
be learned from their approach to trading that we might all apply to
our own portfolios.
Trend Following challenges much of the conventional wisdom
about successful trading and traders. To avoid the influences of
conventional wisdom, I was determined to avoid being influenced
by institutionalized knowledge defined by Wall Street and was
adamant about fighting “flat earth” thinking. During my research,
starting with an assumption and then finding data to support it was
avoided. Instead, questions were asked and then, objectively,
doggedly, and slowly, answers were revealed.
If there was one factor that motivated me to work in this
manner, it was simple curiosity. The more I uncovered about trend
followers, the more I wanted to know. For example, one of the
earliest questions (without an answer already) was learning who

profited when Barings Bank collapsed. My research unearthed a
connection between Barings Bank and trend follower John W.
Henry (now the majority owner of the Boston Red Sox). Henry’s
track record generated new questions, such as, “How did he
discover trend following in the first place?” and “Has his approach
changed in any significant way in the past 30 years?”

considering what mutual fund and hedge fund managers lost during
SirWilliam Bragg
October 2008 and what successful trend followers earned during
the same time, I could not understand why so few investors were
oblivious to even the existence of trend following trading. Other
questions quickly appeared:
• How do trend followers win in the zero-sum game of trading?
• Why has trend following been the most profitable style of
trading?
• What is the philosophical framework of trend followers’
success?
• What are the timeless principles of trend following trading?
• What are trend followers’ worldview of market behavior?
• What are the reasons why trend following is enduring?
Many of the trend followers studied are reclusive and extremely
low key. Some discovered trend following on their own and used it
to make their fortunes out of home offices. Bill Dunn, a successful
trend follower who has beaten the markets for over 30 years, works
out of a quiet, Spartan office in a Florida coastal town. For Wall
Street, this approach to trading is tantamount to sacrilege. It goes
against all the customs, rituals, trappings, and myths we have grown
accustomed to with Wall Street success. In fact, it is my hope that
my profiles of trend followers will correct the public’s miscon-
ception of a successful trader as a harried, intense workaholic who
spends 24/7 in the labyrinth of a Wall Street trading firm,
surrounded by monitors and screaming into a phone.
When the first edition of Trend Following hit the streets in
April 2004 I hoped to assemble the first comprehensive look at
trend following trading. Almost five years since initial publication,

xx Trend Following (Updated Edition): Learn to Make Millions in Up or Down Markets
that goal was realized. How do I know? Since the first edition of
Trend Following, I have met literally dozens of trend following
traders managing collectively billions upon billions of dollars. Their
feedback has been the validation. I never would have expected that
an obscure book put together five years ago would lead me to having
conversations with the likes of Nobel Prize winner HarryMarkowitz
and hedge fund managers Boone Pickens and David Harding, but
itdid.
Validation aside, October and November 2008 made me want
another bite at the apple, another chance to “work” on this book.
And lucky for me, the 2008 market chaos gave me that window.
There is no doubt that October and November 2008 were the most
historic market months since the Great Depression. Most people,
most mutual funds, and most hedge funds lost unimaginable sums
of money. It has long been said that “genius is leverage in a rising
market,” and when the bubble popped in 2008 clearly people who
had long been positioned as genius weren’t that smart after all.
Already guessed where I am headed with this rant? Yes, while the
rest of the world got creamed in 2008, trend followers made
fortunes. Performance numbers for top trend following traders for
October 2008 alone ranged from +5 percent to +40 percent. Making
that much in one month when much of the rest of the world was
losing big time is noteworthy to say the least. My publisher Jim
Boyd agreed with me.

“It is the very essence of prices that they are the offshoot of
the actions of individuals and groups of individuals acting
on their own behalf. The catallactic concept of exchange
ratios and prices precludes anything that is the effect of
actions of a central authority, of people resorting to
violence and threats in the name of society or the state or
of an armed pressure group. In declaring that it is not the
business of the government to determine prices, we do not
step beyond the borders of logical thinking. A government
can no more determine prices than a goose can lay hen’s
eggs.”3
Although government can’t determine prices in the long run, in
the short term as we have all seen with the popping of the credit
bubble, the government can greatly affect the market system.
However, at the end of the day, all we have are prices and
speculation. Because that is the case, finding out how to best

Wall Street players brought millions of players into the real estate

fundamental projections and rode bubbles straight up with no clue
how to exit when those bubbles finally burst. Consider an exchange
between a questioner and President Bush at a December 17, 2007
press conference:
Q: “I wanted to ask you [Mr. President]—I’m a financial
advisor here in Fredericksburg [Virginia], and I wanted to
ask you what your thoughts are on the market going
forward for ’08, and if any of your policies would make
any difference?”

One trend follower summarized the conundrum:

Quantitative Capital Management, L.P.
John W. Henry, one of the best trend followers over the last 25
years, makes a clear distinction between the two strategies: “[I]
believe that an investment strategy can only be as successful as the
discipline of the manager to adhere to the requirements in the face
of market adversity. Unlike discretionary traders, whose decisions
may be subject to behavioral biases, [I] practice a disciplined
investment process.”15
When Henry speaks of decisions that may be subject to
behavioral biases, he is referring to the legions of traders who make
their buy and sell decisions based on the sum of their market
knowledge, their view of the current market environment, or any
number of other factors. In other words, they use their discretion—
hence, the use of discretionary to describe their approach to
trading.
Decisions made at the “discretion” of the trader are subjective
and can be changed or second-guessed. There are no ironclad
assurances that these discretionary trading decisions are not
colored by personal bias. Of course, a trader’s initial choice to
launch a trading system is discretionary. You must make
discretionary decisions such as choosing a system, selecting your
portfolio, and determining a risk percentage. However, after you’ve
decided on the basics, you can choose to systematize these
discretionary decisions and from that point forward, make them
systematic.

Let’s put change in perspective. Markets behave the same as
they did 300 years ago. In other words, markets are the same today
because they always change. This is the philosophical underpinning
of trend following trading. A few years ago, for example, German
mark trading had significant trading volume. Now the Euro has
replaced the German mark. This was a huge, yet typical, change. If
you are flexible, market changes, like changes in life, don’t have to
impact you negatively. Trend traders traded the mark; now they
trade the Euro.
Accepting the inevitability of change is the first step to
understanding trend following philosophy. One trend follower
describes the benefits of understanding change:
“But what won’t change? Change. When a period of difficult
performance continues, however, most investors’ natural
conclusion is that something must be done to fix the
problem. Having been through these draw downs before, we
know that they are unpleasant, but they do not signal that
something is necessarily wrong with the future. During
these periods, almost everyone asks the same question in
these exact words: ‘Have the markets changed?’ I always
tell them the truth: ‘Yes.’ Not only have they changed, but
they will continue to change as they have throughout
history and certainly throughout our 19 years. Trend
following presupposes change. It is based on change.”21
Markets go up, down, and sideways. They trend. They flow.
They surprise. No one can forecast a trend’s beginning or end until
it becomes a matter of record, just like the weather. However, if
your trading strategy is designed to adapt to change, you can take
advantage of the changes to make money as John W. Henry noted:
“If you have a valid basic philosophy, the fact that things
change turns out to be a benefit. At least you can survive.
At the very least, you will survive over the long term. But if

or how irrational they seem at the end, we follow trends.”22 CharlesFaulkner23
What does Henry mean by “a valid basic philosophy?” He is
talking about a trading strategy that can be defined, quantified,
written down, and measured in terms of numbers—as a way to
track trends. Do you have one of those? Does your broker have
one? Does your mutual fund manager have one? Does your high-
flying hedge fund have one? Trend followers do not guess if they
must buy or sell. They know what to do because they have their
“valid basic philosophy” codified in a specific plan. What is behind
the source of those trends, those profits? The Man Group, one of
the largest trend following traders, sees “trends as a persistent price
phenomenon that stem[s] from changes in risk premiums—the
amount of return investors demand to compensate the risks they
are taking. Risk premiums vary massively over time in response to
new market information, changes in economic environment, or
even intangible factors such as shifts in investor sentiment. When
risk premiums decrease or increase, underlying assets have to be
priced again. Because investors typically have different expecta-
tions, large shifts in markets result over several months or even
years as expectations are gradually adjusted. As long as there is
uncertainty about the future, there will be trends for [trend
followers] to capture.”

There are plenty of people who ignore trend following’s
tremendous track record and argue that it is outdated, inferior, or it
plain doesn’t work.
“Has Trend Following Changed?” was the topic of a panel at a
Managed Fund Association’s conference. Patrick Welton saw that
there is no evidence that trend following has changed. To prove this
fact, he constructed 120 trend following models. Some were
reversal-based, and others were not. Some were breakout style
trading systems based on price action with others relying on

Market prices are the objective data. Accepting that truth
allows you to compare and study prices and measure their
movements, even if you know nothing about those markets
themselves. You can look at individual price histories and charts
without knowing which market is which and trade them
successfully. Think about that. That is not what they teach at
Wharton, but it is the foundation of making millions.
Follow the Trend
Don’t try to guess how far a trend will go. You can’t. Peter
Borish, former second-in-command with Paul Tudor Jones, lays
bare the only concern a trader must have:
“Price makes news, not the other way around. A market is
going to go where a market is going to go.”28
The concept of price as the trading cue is just too darn simple
for people to accept. This is seen in the mainstream press that
always emphasizes the wrong numbers. Bill Griffith, an anchor at
CNBC, once pondered:
“At some point, investing is an act of faith. If you can’t
believe the numbers, annual reports, etc., what numbers
can you believe?”
Griffith misses the point when he asks what numbers you can
believe if you can’t believe a company’s annual report. It doesn’t
matter whether you can or cannot believe the earnings statement.
All of these numbers can be doctored, fixed, or cooked. The traded
market price can’t be fixed. It’s the only number to believe. You can
see it every day in the paper or online. However, this simple fact
does not diminish the confusion. Alan Sloan, by all accounts a fine
finance reporter, searches for numbers to trust without ever
understanding how futile his search will be:
“If some of the smartest people on Wall Street can’t trust
the numbers, you wonder who can trust the numbers.”
What numbers is Sloan talking about? Balance sheets? Price-
earnings ratios? You can’t ever trust those numbers. Someone can
always alter them. Beyond that, even if you knew accurate balance
sheet numbers, how can they can help you determine when or how
much to buy or sell? A critical lesson from John W. Henry:

if the trend does, indeed, mature and get big enough to make big
money. How do trend following strategies succeed? MichaelRulle of
Graham Capital Management offers:
“The ability of trend following strategies to succeed
depends on two obvious but important assumptions about
markets. First, it assumes that price trends occur regularly
in markets. Secondly, it assumes that trading systems can
be created to profit from these trends. The basic trading
strategy that all trend followers try to systematize is to ‘cut
losses’ and ‘let profits run.’”33
I asked Charles Faulkner, a modeler of top traders, to expand
upon what at first glance appears to be a simple idea:
“…the first rule of trading is to, ‘Cut your losses, and let
your profits run.’ And then, that it’s the hardest thing to do.

Are you a bull market A good example of not letting profits run can be seen in trading
baby? Can you survive in strategies that take profits off the table before a trend is over. For
any situation?
example, one broker told me that one of his strategies was to ride a
stock up for a 30 percent gain and then exit. That was his strategy.
Let it go up 30 percent and get out. Sounds reasonable. However, a
strategy that uses profit targets is problematic. The biggest problem
is that it goes against the math of getting rich, which is to let your
profits run. If you can’t predict the end or top of a trend, why get
out early and risk leaving profits on the table?
For example, you start with $50,000. The market takes off and
your account swells to $80,000. You could, at that point, quickly
pull your $30,000 profit off the table. Your misconception is that if
you don’t take those profits immediately, they will be gone.
Trend followers know that a $50,000 account may go to
$80,000, back to $55,000, back up to $90,000, and from there,
perhaps, all the way up to $200,000. The person who took profits at
$80,000 is not around to take the ride up to $200,000. Letting your
profits run is tough psychologically. But understand that in trying to
protect every penny of your profit, you actually prevent yourself
from making the big profits.

If you don’t have losses, you are not taking risks. If you don’t
risk, you won’t ever win big. Losses aren’t the problem. It’s how you
deal with them. Ignore losses with no plan and they will come back
to haunt you and your account size. Consider:

inevitable…The rationale for hanging in is that any price
move could be the beginning of a trend, and the occasional
big breakout justifies a string of small losses.”37
Conclusion
Ed Seykota once told me a story about being in Bermuda with
a new trader who wanted to learn the “secrets.” “Just give me the
quick-and-dirty version of your magical trading secrets,” the
neophyte said. Seykota took the new trader out to the beach. They
stood there watching the waves break against the shoreline. The
neophyte asked, “What’s your point?” Seykota said, “Go down to
the shoreline where the waves break. Now begin to time them. Run
out with the waves as they recede and run in as the waves come in.
Can you see how you could get into rhythm with the waves? You
follow the waves out and you follow them in. You just follow their
lead.”
In my search for the facts about trend following, it became clear
that its basic tenets, its philosophical underpinnings, are relevant
not only to trading, but to our lives in general, from business to
personal relationships. I also found in my conversations with the
old pro trend followers that trend following works best when
pursued with unbridled passion.
How important is passion? Author Brett Steenbarger puts Many people would
passion into perspective: sooner die than think; in
fact, they do so.
“Find your passion: the work that stimulates, fascinates, BertrandRussell
and endlessly challenges you. Identify what you find
meaningful and rewarding, and pour yourself into it. If your
passion happens to be the markets, you will find the
fortitude to outlast your learning curve and to develop the
mastery needed to become a professional. If your passion is
not the markets, then invest your funds with someone who
possesses an objective track record and whose investment
aims match your own. Then go forth and pour yourself into
those facets of life that will keep you springing out of bed
each morning, eager to face each day.”38
While assembling Trend Following, it became clear that when
used within the context of passion, the term “trend following” could

Trend followers I met don’t seem to trade with grim resolve or
with an intention to impress others. They are playing the game to
win and enjoying every moment of it. Like other high-level
performers, such as professional athletes and world-class musicians,
they understand how critical it is to maintain a winning attitude for
success. And as Larry Hite reminded, good trend traders ask them-
selves straightforward questions:
“The first question you have to ask yourself: ‘who are you?’
I’m not kidding. And don’t look at your driver’s license! But
what you got to say to yourself: ‘what am I comfortable

What are you going to do exactly? What has to be done? Is
it hard to you? Is it easy? Do you have the materials to do
it? One of the great things about the market is the markets
don’t care about you. The market doesn’t care what color
you are. The markets don’t care if you are short or tall.
They don’t care about anything. They don’t care whether
you leave or stay. The last question you have to ask
yourself: ‘what follows?’ You have to ask yourself, ‘if I do
this and it works, where am I? What have I got?’ Now what
I’ve said may really sound like it’s pretty simple and
common sense, [but think about the failed hedge fund Long

The best way to understand trend following is not by only
reading rules that might make up a particular trend trading strategy,
but also by meeting the men and women who practice it. Unfortu-
nately, investors today are reluctant to concede that they might do
better when it comes to their finances with mentoring or guidance.
Although they will sign up for a cooking course, they won’t take
advantage of wisdom from those who have made fortunes. They
prefer “reinventing the wheel” to modeling their behavior after
proven excellence. However, because I consider role modeling to be
critical to learning correct trading, this chapter profiles excellent
trend followers.

David Harding Richard Donchian
DavidHarding has had tremendous success as a trend following
trader. Today, his trend following fund for clients exceeds $10
billion in assets, give or take a billion or two to the upside. He
typically makes 20 percent a year. How did he reach that pinnacle?
Born in London and reared in Oxfordshire, Harding had always
been interested in investing—a result of his father’s influence, a
horticulturalist who enjoyed betting on the markets. His mother by
comparison was a French teacher. As a young man, he had a natural
inclination for science and quickly found a way to put the talent to
use. Early in his career, he took a job at Sabre Fund Management
where he designed trading systems. Soon thereafter, he met Michael
Adam and Martin Lueck. The trio went on to launch Adam,
Harding, and Lueck (AHL), a trend following firm managing money
for clients. In two years, the Man Group bought AHL out and built
its trend following firm and systems into a monster with $21 billion
under management.3 Harding, while wealthy from the sale, knew
much of Man Group’s success was built around his trading systems.
But he wanted more than to rest on his buyout winnings and over
time built his new firm Winton Capital into a trend-trading
juggernaut. All of that success comes with a basic philosophical
underpinning. But, before jumping into his philosophies, consider
his performance, the main reason I am writing about him (see
Chart 2.1).

I have had the opportunity to interview Harding on two
occasions. Both times he came across as a down-to-earth, hard
worker, but also highly competitive. He wants to win. Did Harding
start out with that great trading performance? No silver spoon for
him. He worked. He practiced:
“I worked for a company [early on], and the people who ran
that took a very old-fashioned approach to trading. About
10 people and I spent the first half of every day drawing
about 400 charts by hand. It was very tedious. I did thisfor

charts forces you to focus in much more minute detail on
data than you normally would, and over a period of time, I
became completely convinced the market was not efficient,
contrary to the theory at the time.4 I became convinced
that markets weren’t efficient and absolutely trended…We
trade everything using trend-following systems, and it
works. By simulation, you come up with ideas and
hypotheses, and you test those. Over the years, what we’ve
done, essentially, is conduct experiments. But instead of
using a microscope or a telescope, the computer is our
laboratory instrument. And instead of looking at the stars,
we’re looking at data and simulation languages…it’s
counterintuitive to think in terms of statistics and
probability. It takes discipline and training; it tortures the
machinery. People are much better, for instance, at judging
whether another person is cheating in a human
relationship. We’re hugely social creatures. We’re keen on
our intuition. But when our intuition is wrong, we’ll still be
very resistant to being corrected. What are traders’ biggest
failures about understanding risk? There’s a human desire
to seek spurious certainty. We try to come to a yes-no
answer, one that’s absolute, when the right answer might be
neither yes nor no. People see things in black and white
when often they need to be comfortable with shades of
gray.”5
Shades of gray are tough medicine to follow, a tough philosophy
to believe down to your core. No one wants to think that way when
it comes to their money, we want to imagine uniform precision is
possible, but if the guys who make the most money think like
Harding, isn’t it worth it for everyone else to try to think that way,
too? At the end of the day, perhaps the best lessons I took from
Harding came from his original marketing materials titled “The
Winton Papers.” His explanation about human decision making
should be absorbed by everyone before they ever put a dollar to
work in the markets:
“The aggregate effect of shared mental biases and imitation
results in patterns of behavior, which while they are
nonconsistent with Mr. Spock-like, rational decision
making or with informational efficiency, are demonstrably

systematic. The market equivalent of these behavioral
patterns is trending, whereby prices tend to move
persistently in one direction or another in response to
information. The widespread adoption of investing
fashions, like indexation, introduces market mechanisms,
which magnify herding behavior on a large scale.”6
Although Harding’s words were written before the events of
2008, his insights explain how the crash unfolded. To those who
want to learn how to trade better, to those who don’t just want to
affix blame for down performance, Harding offers a way out. But, he
knows his “agnostic” approach to investing has critics. “Most people
believe it doesn’t work, or if it did it soon won’t work. We almost
never do anything based on our opinions. If we do, it’s based on
opinions about mathematical phenomenon and statistical
distribution, not opinions about Fed policy.”
Bill Dunn
Whenever you can, count. BillDunn, like Harding, is a trend follower. He made 50 percent
Sir FrancisGalton8 in 2002 when the majority of investors were losing big. He made 21
percent in the one month of October 2008 when most of Wall Street
was melting down. He never hesitates to swing for the home run
because for Dunn, it can be all or nothing. I originally started this
chapter with a profile of Dunn because his performance data is a
clear, consistent, and dramatic demonstration of trend following.
Dunn is founder and chairman of Dunn Capital Management,
Inc. He is one of the purest trend followers alive because he trades
his trading system full throttle, aiming for huge returns. Dunn
Capital has no defined “target” for an annual return (other than
positive). There is nothing in Dunn Capital’s risk management that
precludes annual returns approaching 100 percent. There is no
policy that if, for example, a Dunn program were to be up 50
percent by mid-year that the company would “rest on its laurels,”
so to speak, and dial back trading for the rest of the calendar year.
Further, it is not surprising to see Dunn down 20 percent or more
every three or four years, and in some cases down 50 percent, but
whatever the level of volatility, this independent, self-disciplined,
long-term trend follower never deviates from his core strategy. His
son Daniel Dunn offers:

“We have a risk budgeting scheme that certainly was ahead

ensures that they exit a market when the trade goes against them:

How does Dunn do it? Here are two charts that reflect different
periods of his trading history but tell the same story about his
approach to trading. The first one (Chart 2.3) is the Japanese Yen
trade from December 1994 to June 1996, where Dunn made a
killing.

CHART 2.3: Dunn’s Japanese Yen Trade Source: Dunn Capital Management
1995 was a great year for Dunn. In 2003, for the first time, he
publicly walked through his thought processes—his trend following
process—with an audience of investors, who came away with an
invaluable lesson:
“This is 18 months of the Japanese yen and as you can see,
it went up and down and there was some significant trends
so we should have had an opportunity to make some money
and it turns out we did. Because the WMA is a reversal
system, it’s always in the market, it’s either long or short,
trying to follow and identify the major trends. So while this
is the first signal … that’s shown on the chart and is long,
we obviously must have been short coming in [to this] big
rise. [The rise] was enough to tell us we should quit being
short and start being long and it seemed like a pretty smart
thing do … after we saw that [big rise up].”13

work.
mechanical system. He continues:
Plato
“Then we have significant retracement, which caused a
short signal for the WMA program; our model has always
incorporated near-term volatility and this volatility [as we
went long] was far less than the volatility that was going on
[when we went short].”14
Dunn summarizes the trade:
“Now also because the volatility was very high here … this
rise was—not enough to give us a long signal and as a result,
we rode this short position for nearly a year all the way
down—where we got a long signal that was wrong and we
reversed and went down to short. Now that was a very, very
good market for our program, but some markets are not so
good … ”15
Unfortunately, the confidence of his tone and delivery cannot
be replicated in print.
Be Nimble
Dunn once opined with a straight face after riding a trend to
great profit: “The recent volatility in the energy complex has been
quite exciting and potentially rewarding for the nimble.”16
What exactly does Dunn mean by the word nimble? He means
he is ready to make decisions based on market movement. When an
opportunity to get on a potential trend appears, he is prepared. He
takes the leap. He is nimble when, relying on his system, he reacts
to the Japanese yen move with alacrity because he trusts his trading
plan and his management of risk.
The second chart is the British pound (Chart 2.4) where, unlike
the Japanese yen, the market proved unfavorable for Dunn. It was
a typical whipsaw market, which is always difficult for trend
followers because small losses add up. You can see how he entered
and was stopped out; then entered and was stopped out again.
Remember, trend followers don’t predict markets, they react to
them—so the small losses were part of the game. He managed the
small losses because the British pound was only a portion of his

portfolio. His yen trade more than made up for his losses on the
British pound trade, because no matter how uncomfortable others
are with his approach, for Dunn, big winners offset small losers in
the long run.
CHART 2.4: Dunn’s British Pound Trade Source: Dunn Capital Management
If you told Dunn that his approach made you uncomfortable, I
know what he would say, because he has said it often:
“We don’t make market predictions. We just ride the
bucking bronco.”17
Dunn’s failed trades on the British pound—the up and down, go
nowhere trend—is exactly what he means when he says, “We just
ride the bucking bronco.” In hindsight, you might ask yourself why

he was trading the British pound if he was losing. The simple
answer is that neither he nor anyone else could have predicted
whether or not the British pound would be the next great home run.
The real question is, “Do you stay out of the game because you can’t
predict how the game is going to unfold?”

It’s not uncommon for long-term trend followers to have trades
in place for well over a year, hence the term “long.” If you want day

not the person you should choose as a trading role model.
Following his computerized trading system, Dunn holds long-
term positions in major trends typically trading only two to five
times per year in each market. The original system was and still is
a reversal system, whereby it is always in the market, either long or

whole lot of other people’s money to use a promising system he
developed.”20
Ed Seykota, another trend follower profiled later in this
chapter, is fond of pointing out that when you stop trying to please
others and concentrate on pleasing yourself, you gradually become
aware of what you are passionate about in life. And when that
happens, all sorts of people come out of the woodwork to help you
achieve your goals. Dunn is proof positive.
Life at Dunn Capital
Back in the mid-nineties Marty Bergin arranged for me to visit
Stuart, Florida, and spend a day at Dunn Capital. In one of those
classic small world stories Bergin had been my baseball coach when
I was sixteen in Northern Virginia. Today, he is a key member of
Dunn’s firm.
Dunn’s office is on a quiet street, located off a waterway in the
heart of Stuart, a quiet retirement community 30 miles from West
Palm Beach. There is no receptionist at Dunn Capital, so after you
enter the office, your only recourse is to saunter down a hallway to
see if anyone is in. It feels more like an accountant’s office than a
high-powered trading firm. In fact, the atmosphere is so casual that
there is no atmosphere. Dunn is a shining example of why location,
pretentious offices, and intense activity have little to do with
trading success.
There are only a handful of employees at Dunn because it
doesn’t take many employees to run hisfund (which stands around
$500 million total as of fall of 2008). Plus, employees are not all
traders. The hardest thing to deal with when running a hedge fund
is not the trading decisions, but the accounting and regulatory
concerns. No one at Dunn is tied to screens watching the market
because trades are entered only after an alarm at a PC goes off
indicating a buy or sell signal and thus the need to place an order.

Another reason Dunn has so few employees is because he has a
relatively few well-chosen clients. In fact, he’s fond of saying, “If
people want to invest with me, they know where to find me.” Dunn’s
investors benefit from the fact that there is no disconnect between
his bottom line as a fund manager and the investor’s bottom line—
to wit, trading profits.
Dunn’s fund is different than many because he compounds
absolute returns. He leaves his money on the table by reinvesting in
the fund. As a result, Dunn’s trading capital is not only made up of
clients, but rather the result of systematically reinvesting profits of
his own over a long period of time.

Chapter 2 • Great Trend Followers 41
“We only have two systems. The first system is the one I
started with in 1974. The other system, we developed and
launched in 1989. The major strategic elements of these
two models—how and when to trade, how much to buy and
sell—have never changed in almost 30 years. We expect
change. None of the things that have happened in the
development of new markets over the past 30 years strike
us as making the marketplace different in any essential
way. The markets are just the markets. I know that is
unusual. I know in the past five years a lot of competitors
have purposefully lowered the risk on their models i.e. they
are deleveraging them or trying to mix them with other
things to reduce the volatility. Of course, they have also
reduced their returns.”23
He is addressing a critical issue here: reducing risk to reduce
volatility to appeal to nervous clients. The result is always lower
absolute returns. If you remain fixated on volatility as your enemy,
instead of correctly realizing volatility is the actual source of profit,
you will never “get” trend following trading.
Dunn is very good at using risk management—more commonly

score big. In June 2002, Dunn returned +24.26 percent, then
followed with +14.84 percent for the month of July. By that time, he
was up +37 percent for the same year in which buy-and-holders of
the NASDAQ for this period were crushed. He finished 2002 up
more than 50 percent. His 2008 performance is right there again—
big up when others are down.
How does Dunn do it?
• He cuts his losses.
• He never changes his core strategy: His performance is not a
result of human judgment. Dunn’s trend following is
quantitative and systematic, with no discretionary overrides of
his system-generated trade signals. This is a foreign concept to
those investors who watch CNBC for stock tips. His trading
style doesn’t drift.
• Long-term holding: For holding periods of approximately 3.75
years and beyond, all returns are positive for Dunn. Lesson?
Stay with a system for the long haul and you do well.

==================================================

• Compounding: Dunn compounds relentlessly. He plows profits
back into his trading system and builds upon fresh gains.
• Recovery: Dunn had losing years of 27.1 percent in 1976 and
32.0 percent in 1981 followed by multiyear gains of 500
percent and 300 percent, respectively. You must be able to
accept drawdowns and understand that recovery is, by the
nature of trend trading, around the corner.
• Going short: Dunn goes short as often as he goes long. In
general buy-and-holders never consider the “short side.” If you
are not biased to trend direction, you can win either way.
Drawdowns Are Part of the Game
Dunn Capital has had its share of drawdowns, but his approach
to losses is clear and calm:
“Some experience losses and then wait for gains, which
they hope will come soon…But sometimes they don’t come
soon and sometimes they don’t come at all. And [the
traders] perish.”25
But don’t think for a second that you are not going to suffer
pain, either by trading like Dunn or letting Dunn manage your
money. Because drawdowns—a.k.a. your account going down—will
make you feel like you need an extra dose of Prilosec.
Dunn Capital in Print
There are great lessons to be learned from the performance
data of Dunn, but you can find insight from their writings as well.
The Dunn Capital monthly newsletter adopts a brutally honest tone
when communicating with clients, as evidenced by the following
excerpts from monthly newsletters throughout the spring of 2003:26
1. “As global monetary, fiscal, and political conditions grow
increasingly unsustainable, the trend following strategy that
DUNN steadfastly employs may possibly be one of the few
beneficiaries.”

large, unsustainable imbalances and structural problems that AlvinToffler
must be corrected. Perhaps the equity markets are correctly
predicting a rapid return to more stable and prosperous times.
Perhaps not. Regardless, there seems to be more than ample
fodder for the creation of substantial trends in the coming
months.”
3. “It seems that Mr. Greenspan’s twin bubbles, equities and
housing, working along side the federal, municipal, and
external deficits, will make the coming weeks and months more
interesting than anyone may really care to witness. If this all
seems a bit too grim, do not forget that California, on its own,
would be the fifth largest economy in the world. Currently, the
state has a 33 billion dollar budget gap, which seems almost
certain to result in the peaceful overthrow of the state’s chief
executive in November. Also remember that the analysis
presented here may be nothing more than an incorrect
interpretation of the facts. On the truly bright side, it is
comforting to know that the opinions expressed in this letter
will have absolutely no bearing on the time-tested methods that
DUNN uses to generate trading profits and manage risk.”
I love the fact that even though Dunn has strong political
opinions, he knows that his opinions mean zilch when it comes to
properly trading the market. His political and or economic opinions
do not form the basis of when he buys and sells.
Clients
What problems can prevent clients from seeing Dunn’s way?
• Clients usually do not understand the nature of trend following.
They often panic and pull out just before a big move makes
them a lot of money.
• Clients may start asking for the trader to change his approach.
Although they may not have articulated this directly to the
fund manager, they really wanted the trend following strategy

customized for them before investing their money in the first
place. The manager is then faced with a difficult decision: Take
the client’s money and make money through management fees
(which can be lucrative) or trade the capital as originally
designed. Trading a trend following system as originally
designed is the optimal path in the long run.
If clients try to change or adjust how Dunn trades, he either lets
them go or doesn’t take them on as a client in the first place:
“A person must be an optimist to be in this business, but I
also believe it’s a cyclical phenomenon for several other
reasons. In our 18 years of experience, we’ve had to endure
a number of long and nasty periods during which we’ve
asked ourselves this same question. In late 1981, our
accounts had lost about 42 percent over the previous 12
months, and we and our clients were starting to wonder if
we would ever see good markets again. We continued to
trade our thoroughly researched system, but our largest
client got cold feet and withdrew about 70 percent of our
total equity under management. You guessed it. Our next
month was up 18 percent, and in the 36 months following,
their withdrawal of our accounts made 430 percent!”27
This observation always made me wonder why Dunn is not
studied in MBA programs. Are Harvard MBAs aware of Dunn’s
trading when they graduate?
Check Your Ego at the Door

demands taking personal responsibility for one’s actions, and Dunn
makes it clear that he is responsible for Dunn Capital.
One of the interesting traits of the many trend followers I spoke
with personally or observed from afar is their honesty. If you listen
closely to their words and review their performance data, they are
more than happy to tell you exactly what they are doing and why.

• Dunn goes short as often as long.

• Dunn’s designed risk is a 1 percent chance of a 20 percent or
greater loss in a month.
John W. Henry
The performance data of Bill Dunn and John W. Henry shows
them to be trend followers cut from similar cloth. They are both
astonishingly successful self-made men who started without formal
association to Wall Street. They developed trading systems in the
1970s that have made them millions of dollars again and again.
Their correlated performance data shows that they both trade for
absolute returns and often trade in the same trends at the same
time.
Henry’s performance is clear (Chart 2.5):
Henry has captured some of the great trends of our generation.
By all available evidence, Henry was on the other side of the Barings
Bankblowout in 1995. In the zero-sum game, he won what Barings
Bank lost. More recently, in 2002, Henry was up 40 percent while
the NASDAQ was spiraling downwards. He, like Dunn, doesn’t have
a strategy that could be remotely considered “active or day
trading,” but when his trading system tells him, “It’s time,” he can

Also, I can’t help but notice that, as the owner of the Boston Red
Sox, Henry applies the basic tenets of trend following—simple
heuristics for decision making, mathematics, statistics, and
application of a system—to the world of sports. Henry and baseball
are connected clearly, as discussed in Chapter 5, “Baseball:

“There has been surprisingly little change. Models we
developed 20 years ago are still in place today. Obviously,
we trade a different mix of markets. We’ve also added new
programs over the last 20 years, but relative to many of our
peers, we have not made significant adjustments in our
trading models. We believe that markets are always
changing and adjusting, and the information that’s
important to investors will also change. In the 1980s,
everyone was interested in the money supply figures…
everyone would wait by their phones until that number
came out. In the 1990s, the information du jour was

that’s what we’re trying to exploit. Even if you have better
and faster dissemination of information, the one thing we
haven’t really improved is people’s ability to process
information. We’re trying to exploit people’s reaction,
which is embedded in prices and leads to trends. These
reactions are fairly stable and may not require major
adjustments of models.”32
He reiterates an important philosophical tenet of trend
following: In looking at the long term, change is constant. And
because change is constant, uncertainty is constant. From
uncertainty, trends emerge. It is the exploitation of these trends
that forms the basis of trend following profit. All of the cutting edge
technology and news-gathering capabilities in the world are not

there is anxiety because you often do not know how far you

A World-View Philosophy
Trend followers like Henry and Dunn could not have developed
their trading systems without first deciding how they were going to
view the world. Each, through experience, education, and research,
came to an understanding of how markets work before they
determined how to trade them. What each of them found,
separately, was that market trends are more pervasive than people
think, and could have been traded in the same way 200 years ago
as they are today.
To that end Henry spent years studying historical price data
from the 18th and 19th centuries in order to prove to himself that
there was only one successful way to approach trading. When he
explains his investment philosophy, he is crystal clear about what it
is and what it is not:
• Long-term trend identification: Trading systems ignore short-
term volatility in the attempt to capture superior returns
during major trending markets. Trends can last as long as a few
months or years.
• Highly disciplined investment process: Methodology is
designed to keep discretionary decision making to a minimum.

50 Trend Following (Updated Edition): Learn to Make Millions in Up or Down Markets
• Risk management: Traders adhere to a strict formulaic risk
management system that includes market exposure weightings,
stop-loss provisions, and capital commitment guidelines that
attempt to preserve capital during trendless or volatile periods.
• Global diversification: By participating in more than 70
markets and not focusing on one country or region, they have
access to opportunities that less diversified firms may miss.
As I have seen, some traders dismiss trend following as simply
predictive technical analysis. Henry is not some “technical
indicator guru” trying to make predictions:
“…‘Some people call what we do technical analysis, but
JWH just identifies and follows trends. It’s like, if you are in
the fashion world, you have to follow trends, or you’re
yesterday’s news.’ But as with technical analysis, trend
followers believe that markets are smarter than any of their
individual participants. In fact, they make it their business
not to try to figure out why markets are going up or down
or where they’re going to stop.”36
Henry’s use of fashion as a metaphor for trend following hits the
nail on the head and goes beyond obvious comparison between
trends in clothing and trends in markets. He explains that to be
fashionable, you have no choice but to follow stylistic trends of the
moment. Likewise, trend followers have no choice but to react to
trends, and like those who dictate fashion, successful trend
followers exploit trends long before the public is paying attention.
We don’t predict the Trend followers would agree with H. L. Mencken when he said,

“Hours and hours were spent in the depths of the university

think, photo copying grain prices, and interest rate data—

at overseas interest rates back to that time period. A lot of

that things really jumped around back then as they do
now.”42
It reminded me of the scene in the Wizard of Oz when Toto
pulls back the curtain to reveal how the wizard really works his
magic. It was clear that there were no secret formulas or hidden
strategies with Henry. There were no short cuts. This was slow,
painstaking trench warfare in the bowels of a research library,
armed only with a photocopying machine to memorialize price
histories for their analysis.
Years later, I was inspired to do my own price research. My
objective was not to use price data at that time in a trading system
but to see instead how little markets had changed. One of the best
places to research historical market data in newspapers and
magazines from over 100 years ago is the U.S. National Agricultural
Library. Don’t be misled by the word “Agricultural.” You can review
the stacks at this library and spend hours pouring over magazines
from the 1800s. Like Henry’s firm, I discovered that markets were
indeed basically the same then as now.
John W. Henry on the Record
I had the chance to hear Henry speak in person at an FIA
Research Division Dinner held in New York City years back. This
was only months after the Barings Bank debacle. During the Q&A,
Henry revealed some of the qualities shared by all successful trend
followers. This excerpt from the post-dinner Q&A shows Henry at
his best, full of grace and good humor. He refused to waste time
discussing fundamentals and offered a genuine appreciation of the
nature of change:
Moderator: The question that always comes up for
technicians is, “Do you believe the markets have changed?”

==================================================

Henry: It always comes up whenever there are losses,
especially prolonged losses. I heard it, in fact, when I
started my career 14 years ago. They were worrying, “Is
there too much money going into trend following?” You
laugh, but I can show you evidence in writing of this. My
feeling is that markets are always changing. But if you
have a basic philosophy that’s sound, you’re going to be
able to take advantage of those changes to greater or less-
er degrees. It is the same with using good, sound business
principles—the changing world is not going to materially
hurt you if your principles are designed to adapt. So the
markets HAVE changed. But that’s to be expected and it’s
good.
Everything flows. Female Voice: John, you’re noted for your discipline. How
Heraclitus did you create that, and how do you maintain that?
Henry: Well, you create discipline by having a strategy you
really believe in. If you really believe in your strategy, that
brings about discipline. If you don’t believe in it, in other
words, if you haven’t done your homework properly, and
haven’t made assumptions that you can really live with
when you’re faced with difficult periods, then it won’t
work. It really doesn’t take much discipline, if you have a
tremendous confidence in what you’re doing.
Male Voice: I’d like to know if your systems are completely
black box.
Henry: We don’t use any black boxes. I know people refer
to technical trend following as “black box,” but what you
have is really a certain philosophy of trading. Our
philosophy is that there is an inherent return in trend
following. I know CTAs that have been around a lot longer
than I have, who have been trading trends: Bill Dunn,
Millburn, and others who have done rather well over the
last 20 to 30 years. I don’t think it’s luck year after year
after year.
Successful trend followers are often described as simply
profiting from their “good luck” when in fact, it is not luck but
discipline that enables them to win absolute returns.

What this transcript cannot recreate on the page is the
audience’s reaction. I remember looking around at all the Henry
fans jammed into that Wall Street hotel suite and thinking,
“Everyone in this room is far more interested in viewing Henry as a
personality—a rock star—instead of figuring out what he does to
make money.” Henry is one of the best traders for the last 25 years.
But shouldn’t the goal be to try and find similar success in whatever
walk of life you pursue rather than only applaud Henry’s?
Change Is Overrated
Often more vocal than other trend followers over the years,
Henry has been publicly forthright about trend following for years.
For instance, his presentation in Geneva, Switzerland could have
been a semester course in trend following for anyone open to the
message:
“We began trading our first program, in 1981 and this was
after quite a bit of research into the practical aspects of a
basic philosophy of what drives markets. The world was
frighteningly different in those days than it is today when I
was designing what turned out to be a trend following
system. That approach—a mechanical and mathematical
system—has not really changed at all. Yet the system
continues to be successful today, even though there has
been virtually no change to it over the last 18 years.”44
I can’t help but notice that the “we haven’t changed our
system” chorus is sung not only by Dunn, but by Henry and
numerous other trend followers as well. And how does this timeless When people are in doubt,

Fade the Fed
Regular overreaction to Federal Reserve announcements is part
of Wall Street life. Some so-called pros take the Federal Reserve’s
words and act on them even if there is no real way to know what
any of it even means at that moment. And does it make logical
sense to worry about what the Fed isgoing to do if there is no clear
way to decipher where they might go to begin with? The Fed, to the
best of my knowledge, has never offered any statement you could
rely on that would dictate, “Buy 1000 share of GOOG today.”

Henry’s trend following system is predicated on price action,
not Bernanke’s words. Henry is ready for a change in price at all
times. The moving lips of a Fed’s head have no impact if a trading
style has been developed from the ground up to respond to change:
“I know that when the Fed first raises interest rates after
months of lowering them, you do not see them the next day
lowering interest rates. And they don’t raise rates and then
a few days later or a few weeks later lower them. They raise,
raise, raise, raise…[PAUSE]…raise, raise, raise. And then
once they lower, they don’t raise, lower, raise, lower, raise,
lower. Rather they lower, lower, lower, lower. There are
trends that tend to exist, whether they are capital flows or
interest rates…if you have enough discipline, or if you only
trade a few markets, you don’t need a computer to trade
this way.”47
Henry knows human minds can create anxiety by conjuring up
terrifying future market scenarios, so he relies on his system to
keep him focused in the present on what he can actually control—
his system.

Key Points
• Henry’s first managed fund was staked with $16,000 in 1981.
He now owns the Boston Red Sox baseball team.
• Henry has a four-point investment philosophy: long-term trend
identification, highly disciplined investment process, risk
management, and global diversification.
• Henry understands change. This understanding gives him a
distinct advantage.

statement of his is, “Everybody gets what they want out of the
market.” This was a response to a question about trading, but I feel
certain that Seykota would say it also applies to life.
Although almost completely unknown to both traders and
laymen alike, Seykota’s achievements rank him as one of the best
trend followers (and traders) of our time. I first met Seykota at a
small beachside cafe. I had received an invitation from Seykota to
get together to discuss the outreach possibilities of the Internet.
During our first meeting, he asked me what I thought Richard
Dennis was looking for when he hired his student traders the
Turtles (Seykota knew I had a website called TurtleTrader.com). My
reply was to say I thought Dennis was looking for students who
could think in terms of odds. Seykota’s response was to ask me if
my reply was my own thinking or something I was told by someone
else. This was my first indoctrination to Seykota’s “direct nature.”

is headed or the trend is up when price is moving up, etc.’ EdSeykota52
His replies were simple, straight-forward answers to the
questions asked of him. Later, I learned through the event
organizer that a large majority of the audience (who paid
good money, presumably to learn the ‘secrets’ of trading
from a market wizard) were not impressed. Many felt they
had wasted their time and money listening to Seykota.
Seykota’s message couldn’t be clearer to anyone who cared
to listen. The answers were found in the very questions
each person asked. Don’t ask, ‘How do you know the trend
is moving up?’ Instead, ask, ‘What is going to tell me the
trend is up?’ Not, ‘What do you think of gold?’ Instead, ask,
‘Am I correctly trading gold?’ Seykota’s answers effectively
placed everyone in front of a huge mirror, reflecting their
trading self back at them. If you don’t even know the
question to ask about trading, much less the answers, get
out of the business and spend your life doing something you
enjoy.”50
How would you have reacted to Seykota’s speech? Walk out or
be curious? Think about it.
Performance Second to None
What are Seykota’s performance numbers? “Seykota earned,
after fees, nearly 60 percent on average each year from 1990 to
2000 managing proprietary money in his managed futures
program.”51
But Seykota is different than Harding, Henry, and Dunn. He
literally has been a one-man shop his entire career. There is no
fancy office or other employees. He does not hold himself out as a
money manager and he is extremely selective of his clients. He
doesn’t really care whether people have money that they want him
to trade or not. I’ve had the chance to review his monthly
performance data for the decade of the 1990s. The month-by-
month numbers are eye popping. Seykota takes big risks, and he
gets big rewards.

About Ed Seykota
Seykota was born in 1946. He earned his Bachelor of Science
from MIT in 1969 and by 1972 had embarked on the trading career
he pursues to this day—investing for his own account and the
accounts of a few select others. He was self-taught, but influenced
in his career by Amos Hostetter and Richard Donchian.
Early in his career, Seykota was hired by a major broker. He
conceived and developed the first commercial computerized
trading system for client money in the futures markets. According
to Jack Schwager’s Market Wizards, he increased one client’s
account from $5,000 to $15,000,000 in just 12 years.
For the past few years, Seykota has worked from a home office
in Incline Village, Nevada. His trading is largely confined to the few
minutes it takes to run his internally written computer program,
which generates trading signals for the next day. He also mentors
traders through his Web site and his Trading Tribe, a widespread
community of like-minded traders. He has served as a teacher and
mentor to some great traders, including Michael Marcus and David
Druz. Seykota’s Trading Tribe is discussed further in Chapter 6,
“Human Behavior.”
The Seykota “Secret”
Seykota’s style is direct. He enjoys debunking market ignorance
with terse, Zen-like statements that force the listener to look
inward:
“The biggest secret about success is that there isn’t any big
secret about it, or if there is, then it’s a secret from me, too.
The idea of searching for some secret for trading success
misses the point.”53
That self-deprecating response emphasizes process over
outcome, but don’t be misled by his modesty, because he gets
impatient with hypocrisy and mindlessness. He is a fearless trader
and does not suffer fools gladly. Yet when he remembers his first
trade, I saw how he uncovered the passion for what he does:
“The first trade I remember, I was about five years old in
Portland, OR. My father gave me a gold-colored medallion,
a sales promotion trinket. I traded it to a neighbor kid for

                     PAGE 88

five magnifying lenses. I felt as though I had participated in
a rite of passage. Later, when I was 13, my father showed
me how to buy stocks. He explained that I should buy when
the price broke out of the top of a box and to sell when it
broke out of the bottom. And that’s how I got started.”54
On how he first started trading:
“I saw a letter published by Richard Donchian, which
implied that a purely mechanical trend following system
could beat the markets. This too seemed impossible to me.
So I wrote computer programs (on punch cards in those
days) to test the theories. Amazingly, his [Donchian]
theories tested true. To this day, I’m not sure I understand
why or whether I really need to. Anyhow, studying the
markets, and backing up my opinions with money, was so
fascinating compared to my other career opportunities at
the time, that I began trading full time for a living.”55
Trading was in his blood at a young age and at age 23, he went
out on his own with about a half-dozen accounts in the
$10,000–25,000 range.56
Seykota had found an alternative to a Wall Street career built
only on commissions. From the beginning, he worked for incentive
fees alone. If he made money for his clients, he got paid. If he did
not make money, he did not get paid. Does your broker, mutual
fund manager, or hedge fund work like that?
Amos Hostetter: “Never Mind the Cheese”
As a new trader, Seykota passed through Commodities Corp, a
trader training ground then based in Princeton, New Jersey. One of
his mentors was Amos Hostetter. Hostetter made phenomenal
amounts of money trading. (He died early in an auto accident, but
his son is a billionaire today.) When a market’s supply-and-demand
prospects looked promising, Hostetterwould put up one-third of his
ultimate position. If he lost 25 percent of that stake, he’d get out.
“Never mind the cheese,” he’d crack, “let me out of the trap.” But
when the market swung his way, he’d add another third, taking a
final position when prices climbed half as high as he thought they’d
go. Hostetter’s strategies were so successful that they were com-
puterized so other traders could learn to duplicate his success.57

turn affects the original variable, and so on. An example of this is
money in a bank account. Money in the bank earns interest, which
increases the size of the account. Now that the account is larger, it
earns even more interest, which adds more money to the account.
This goes on and on. What system dynamics attempts to do is
understand the basic structure of a system, and thus understand
the behavior it can produce. Many of these systems and problems
that are analyzed can be built as models on a computer. System

calculations than can the mental model of the human mind.”59
This type of thought process and computer modeling is not only
a foundation of Seykota’s success, but it can be seen across the
trend following success landscape.

“To avoid whipsaw losses, stop trading.”

Lesson: You will have losses. Accept them.
“Here’s the essence of risk management: Risk no more than
you can afford to lose, and also risk enough so that a win is
meaningful. If there is no such amount, don’t play.”
Lesson: Money management is crucial. This is further
investigated in Chapter 10.
“Trend following is an exercise in observing and responding
to the ever-present moment of now. Traders who predict
the future dwell upon a nonexistent place, and to the extent
they also park their ability to act out there, they can miss
opportunities to act in the now.”
Lesson:All we have is now. It is much better to react to the fact
of market movements in present time than a future time that
doesn’t exist.
“Markets are fundamentally volatile. No way around it. Your
problem is not in the math. There is no math to get you out
of having to experience uncertainty.”
Lesson: You can crunch all the numbers you like, but your
“gut” still has to handle the ups and downs. You have to live with
and feel the uncertainty.
“I recall, in the old days, people showing a lot of concern
that markets are different and trend following methods no
longer work.”

he is the best trader in history, period. Isn’t he? Who else
comes close? I don’t know of anyone. Livermore made
fortunes, but had drawdowns to zero. There are numerous
examples of managers with a few years of meteoric returns
who subsequently blow up. The household names, Buffet
and Soros, are less than half of Ed’s return each year. One
might apply filters such as Sharpe ratios, AUM, etc., and
perhaps massage the results. But as far as the one central
metric—raw percentage profit—Ed is above anyone else I
know, and I’ve been around managing money for 20 years.”

Jason Russell: Seykota Student #2
Russell is a student of Ed Seykota’s. He provided me a glimpse
into the process of training with Seykota:
“Through working with Ed, I have learned many things in
the past couple of years, one of the most important being:
Apply trend following to your life as well as to your trading.
Freeing yourself from the need to understand “why” is as
useful when dealing with family, friends, and foes as it is
when entering or exiting a trade. It also has the added
benefit of making you a much better trader.”
Most traders cannot recognize how simple life really is. This is
similar to what Russell describes as Seykota’s view of simplicity:
“There is simplicity beyond sophistication. Ed spends a lot
of time there. He listens, he feels, he speaks with clarity. He
is a master of his craft. Before working with Ed, I spent
years learning, reading, and earning various designations.
All of this has been useful as it provides me with a high level
of technical proficiency. However, somehow through this
whole process, I have gained a strong appreciation for
simplifying. MilesDavis was once asked what went through
his mind when he listened to his own music. He said: ‘I
always listen to what I can leave out.’ That sounds like Ed.”

being in his presence. It was tough surviving working with
him because of the mental gymnastics involved. If you have
a personality weakness, he finds it—fast. But it’s a positive
thing because successful traders must understand
themselves and their psychological weaknesses. My time
with Ed was one of the greatest times of my life and gave me
tremendous confidence—but I don’t trade any differently
because of it. A guy like Ed Seykota is magic.”64

ThomasVician, Jr. felt it was important to tell me about Seykota’s life beyond the
Student of Ed Seykota’s markets:
“I lived with Ed and his family for a little over two months
in early 1997. One of the more amazing things I observed
about Ed is that he has gifts in so many areas, trading being
just one of them. He showed me a music video that he
produced many years ago. It was an excellent production.
He also recorded an album several years before the video.
He is a very talented musician. My favorite song was Bull
Market, which he used to play for me on his acoustic guitar.
During the time I was with him, he was very involved in
experiments that attempted to redefine airflows as they
relate to the Bernoulli Principle. He spent an enormous
amount of time putting together academic papers and
sending them to several experts in the field concerning this
work. He is the consummate scientist. One day, we took a
‘field trip’ to visit Ed’s state legislator to discuss Charter
School legislation and the impact on Ed’s children and the
students of Nevada. Not long after I left, Ed ran for the local
school board. He has a keen interest in and knowledge of
education. Ed Seykota will never be defined solely by
trading. He has a love of learning and is a modern-day
Renaissance man.”
Charles Faulkner, profiled in Chapter 6, once said that if
Seykota had wanted to stay in academia, he would have won a
Nobel Prize. That said, Seykota would have abhorred life in an ivory
tower and the accompanying politics. This is a man who relishes
the here and now, where he can confront real problems and provide
real solutions. He chooses to live real trading, not admire it.

the market. Some people seem to like to lose, so they win by
losing money.”
• Seykota: “To avoid whipsaw losses, stop trading.”
• Seykota: “Risk no more than you can afford to lose and also
risk enough so that a win is meaningful.”
• Seykota: “Trend following is an exercise in observing and
responding to the ever-present moment of now.”
• Seykota: “Fundamentalists and anticipators may have
difficulties with risk control because a trade keeps looking
‘better’ the more it goes against them.”
• Seykota: “Until you master the basic literature and spend some
time with successful traders, you might consider confining your
trading to the supermarket.”

About Keith Campbell
Perhaps one reason trend followers respect the unexpected is
because many of them did not set out to become traders. When
unexpectedly exposed to trading many realized how well suited
they were for it and eventually came upon trend following as the
ideal strategy. In the 1960s, Campbell took a job in California where
he could both ski and surf. When his roommate moved out of their
California apartment, he advertised for a replacement and ended up
with Chet Conrad, a commodity broker. Campbell recalled that,
“(Conrad) got me into trading as a customer. But he was always
moaning he didn’t have enough money to trade.” Campbell then put
together $60,000 from 12 investors to form his first futures fund
with three advisors—a fundamentalist, a bar chartist, and a point-
and-figure advocate. When that fund struggled, he started the
Campbell Fund and then took it over on January 1, 1972. A few
years later, Campbell and Conrad went their separate ways. Conrad

Many skeptics like to think trend followers are the only ones
with drawdowns. The chart, however, shows the truth of drawdowns
across several indexes and fund types.
The key is to accept drawdowns and be able to manage them
when they occur. Otherwise, you are left watching the NASDAQ
drop 77 percent peak to trough over 2000—2002 with no plan on
what to do next. Buy and hope?
Campbell and Company Still, Campbell’s strategies were often doubted by Wall Street,
analyzes only technical especially the “old guard” who like to gripe how supposedly risky
market data, not any
trend following is. Campbell refutes that:
economic factors external
to market prices.71 “A common perception is that futures markets are
extremely volatile, and that investing in futures is therefore
very risky, much riskier than equity investments. The
reality is that generally futures prices are less volatile than
common stocks prices. It is the amount of leverage
available in futures which creates the perception of high
risk, not market volatility. The actual risk involved in
futures trading depends, among other things, upon how
much leverage is used.”70
Managing the use of leverage is a crucial component of trend
followers’ risk management. It is the part of the trading strategy that
allows them to keep coming back day after day and year after year
to trade and win.
Correlation and Consistency
Most trend followers earn their returns at different times than
common benchmark measures, such as the S&P stock index.
Campbell (see Chart 2.10), like John W. Henry & Company and
other longtime trend followers, is not correlated with major stock
market indexes.

Even more remarkable than his lack of correlation to the S&P

Management managed over $1 billion. For Parker, like Bill Dunn,
trappings appeared meaningless.
Parker grew up in Lynchburg, Virginia, graduating from the
University of Virginia. He was working as an accountant in
Richmond when he applied to Richard Dennis’ training program
and was the first student Dennis accepted. Pragmatic and
consistent, he went on to start his own money management firm,
Chesapeake Capital, in 1988. He made the decision to risk less and
make less for clients, so he took his Turtle trading approach, a trend
following strategy, and ratcheted it down a degree. In other words,
he took an aggressive system for making money and customized it
to investors who were comfortable with lower leverage.
Even though he was shooting for lower risk he returned 61.82
percent on his money in one incredible year of 1993. That put his
firm on the map (see Chart 2.12). However, he is generally in the
12–14 percent return range today. His more conservative approach
to trend following is different from Dunn or Seykota who have
always pushed their systems for absolute returns. Parker does it a

Ask yourself if you want to be right or do you want to win. They

Parker Downplays Intelligence
Trend following success is much more predicated on discipline
than pure academic achievement. Parker is candid about the
intelligence required at his firm:
“We have a system in which we do not have to rely on our
intellectual capabilities. One of the main reasons why what
we do works in the markets is that no one can figure out
what is happening.”79
The best trend followers are willing to admit that pure I.Q. is
not the key. They also know that the latest news flash of the day is
not information that figures into their decisions about when to buy,
when to sell, or how much to buy or sell at any time. Parker adds,
“Our pride and opinions should not interfere with sound trading
approaches.”81
Parker has also trained and influenced other traders. Look no
further than an associate of Parker’s, Salem Abraham.

Salem Abraham does it differently than most trend followers.

Chapter 2 • Great Trend Followers 75
It would be hard to find a financial firm in the United States as
removed from Wall Street, geographically and culturally, as the
Abraham Trading Company. Housed in the same building where his
grandfather Malouf Abraham once chewed the fat with local
politicians and ranchers while building a sizable land-speculation
business, the company has evolved into one of the nation’s most
unusual trading operations.82
It was while he was a student at Notre Dame University that
Abraham found he had a natural ability for and interest in trading.
Like Greg Smith, one of Seykota’s students, he researched which
traders were the most successful and discovered trend following.
Abraham returned home to the family ranch in Canadian, Texas
after graduating and discussed the idea of trading for a living with
his “granddad,” who cautiously agreed to help him get started.
According to Abraham, he was to “try it out for six months,” and
then discard the idea (“throw the quote machine out the window”)
if he failed.83
There was no failure for Abraham. He quickly developed a Wall I think the only cardinal

Abraham‘s “meat-and-potatoes” approach to trading is no
nonsense:
“The underlying premise of ATC’s [Abraham Trading
Company] trading approach is that commodity interests
will, from time to time, enter into periods of major price
change to either a higher or lower level. These price
changes are known as trends, which have been observed
and recorded since the beginning of market history. There

designed to exploit these price moves.”85
When asked about his relationship with Parker, Abraham gave
an example of six degrees of separation and the randomness of life:
“We do in fact know JerryParker with Chesapeake Capital.
The shortest version I can give you is he is my dad’s sister’s
husband’s brother’s daughter’s husband. I’m not sure you
can call that related but something like that. I first learned
about the futures industry by talking to him while he visited
in-laws in Texas.”
A lesson learned? Keep your eyes open to possibilities, as you
never know where opportunity will appear. Parker knows
Abraham’s age (and success) can cause problems:
“Sometimes people have a tendency to resent a young guy
who’s making so much money,” said Jerry Parker, himself a
hedge fund manager from Richmond, Virginia, who has
been an investor in Mr. Abraham’s fund for the last five
years. “I just think he has a lot of guts.”87
Consider Abraham’s trading performance (see Chart 2.13).
If there is a lesson to be learned from Abraham, it is simply that
if you want to become a trend follower, it doesn’t hurt to get out
there and meet the players.
Parker and Abraham are ultimately realists. They play the zero-
sum game hard in similar ways and excel at it, but they have also
found a way to balance key components of their lives. Without
compromising integrity, they have found a way to apply their
trading philosophy and at the same time please clients.

RichardDennis89 death-knell of trend following. It is true that Dennis’ career had big
ups and downs, but trend following itself is doing just fine.
Dennis was born and raised in Chicago in close proximity to the
exchanges. He began trading as a teenager with $400 saved from his
pizza delivery job. Because he was too young to qualify for
membership on the exchange, he would send signals to his father,
who would do the actual trading. At 17, he finally landed a job in
the pit as a runner on the exchange floor and started trading.88
Dennis’ Students: The Turtles
Eventually, Dennis would achieve fantastic wealth with profits
in the hundreds of millions of dollars. However, his real fame would
come from his experiment in teaching trading to new traders.
In 1983, he made a bet with his partner William Eckhardt.
Dennis believed that trading could be taught. Eckhardt belonged to
the “you’re born with it or you’re not” camp. They decided to
experiment by seeing whether they could teach novices successful
trading. Twenty-plus students were accepted into two separate
training programs. Dennis called his students “Turtles,” after
visiting a turtle-breeding farm in Singapore.
How did it start? Dennis ran classified ads saying “Trader
Wanted’’ and was immediately overwhelmed by some 1,000 queries
from would-be traders. He picked 20+ novices, trained them for two

(i.e. Curtis Faith). Their root problems might be traced to poor
personal discipline coupled with an incomplete understanding of
the psychology needed to win. Perhaps, after some Turtles went out
on their own, they could not cope without the safety net of being
under Dennis’ wing. Of course, JerryParker is a monster exception
to this theory—he is absolutely the most successful of the turtle
traders.
This is not a criticism of the system Dennis taught his students.
It is rather an acknowledgement that some people could not stick
with the trading system as it was taught them or perhaps were never
comfortable with it to begin with. In stark contrast, Bill Dunn was
completely unknown to the general public when the Turtles burst
onto the scene in the 1980s. Since that time, Dunn has slowly
overtaken most, if not all, trend followers in terms of absolute
performance. You have to wonder if something about the initial
small one-man shop of Dunn set in motion the habits that enabled
him to roar past the Turtles that seemingly had the superior head
start. For years, many of the Turtles also refused to acknowledge
they were even trend followers while Dunn was always candid. Did
the hype and mystery of the Turtles set forward in the Market
Wizards books help most of them in the long run?
All this said, the story of the Turtles is so widespread that the
criteria Dennis used to select his students is still insightful (see
more in The Complete TurtleTrader, my second book).
Turtle Selection Process

comfortable with.

computed his moving averages, posted his own charts by hand, and
developed his market signals—without the benefit of an accurate

Much of Donchian’s work went unnoticed by the numerous
stars of finance that followed him. Dixon makes it clear that her
mentor’s work preceded and prefigured that of the academic
theorists who developed the foundations of the modern theory of
finance. Long before Harvard’s John Litner published his
quantitative analysis of the benefits of including managed futures in
a portfolio with stocks and bonds, Donchian used concepts like
diversification and risk control, key elements of modern portfolio

==================================================

Chapter 2 • Great Trend Followers 87
What were his rules? The following Donchian trading guidelines
were first published in 1934:
General Guides
1. Beware of acting immediately on a widespread public opinion.
Even if correct, it will usually delay the move.
2. From a period of dullness and inactivity, watch for and prepare
to follow a move in the direction in which volume increases.
3. Limit losses and ride profits, irrespective of all other rules.
4. Light commitments are advisable when market position is not
certain. Clearly defined moves are signaled frequently enough
to make life interesting and concentration on these moves will
prevent unprofitable whip-sawing.
5. Seldom take a position in the direction of an immediately
preceding three-day move. Wait for a one-day reversal.
6. Judicious use of stop orders is a valuable aid to profitable
trading. Stops may be used to protect profits, to limit losses,
and from certain formations such as triangular foci to take
positions. Stop orders are apt to be more valuable and less
treacherous if used in proper relation to the chart formation.
7. In a market in which upswings are likely to equal or exceed
downswings, heavier position should be taken for the upswings
for percentage reasons— a decline from 50 to 25 will net only
50 percent profit, whereas an advance from 25 to 50 will net
100 percent profit.
8. In taking a position, price orders are allowable. In closing a
position, use market orders.
9. Buy strong-acting, strong-background commodities and sell
weak ones, subject to all other rules.
10. Moves in which rails lead or participate strongly are usually
more worth following than moves in which rails lag.
11. A study of the capitalization of a company, the degree of
activity of an issue, and whether an issue is a lethargic truck
horse or a spirited race horse is fully as important as a study of
statistical reports.

==================================================

88 Trend Following (Updated Edition): Learn to Make Millions in Up or Down Markets
Donchian Technical Guidelines
1. A move followed by a sideways range often precedes another
move of almost equal extent in the same direction as the
original move. Generally, when the second move from the
sideways range has run its course, a counter move approaching
the sideways range may be expected.
2. Reversal or resistance to a move is likely to be encountered:
a. On reaching levels at which in the past, the commodity has
fluctuated for a considerable length of time within a narrow
range
b. On approaching highs or lows
3. Watch for good buying or selling opportunities when trend lines
are approached, especially on medium or dull volume. Be sure
such a line has not been hugged or hit too frequently.
4. Watch for “crawling along” or repeated bumping of minor or
major trend lines and prepare to see such trend lines broken.
5. Breaking of minor trend lines counter to the major trend gives
most other important position taking signals. Positions can be
taken or reversed on stop at such places.
6. Triangles of ether slope may mean either accumulation or dis-
tribution depending on other considerations, although triangles
are usually broken on the flat side.
7. Watch for volume climax, especially after a long move.
8. Don’t count on gaps being closed unless you can distinguish
between breakaway gaps, normal gaps, and exhaustion gaps.
9. During a move, take or increase positions in the direction of the
move at the market the morning following any one-day
reversal, however slight the reversal may be, especially if
volume declines on the reversal.
Donchian’s Student
Barbara Dixon was one of the more successful female trend
traders in the business. She graduated from Vassar College in 1969,
but because she was a woman and a history major, no one would
hire her as a stockbroker. Undaunted, she finally took a job at

her own in 1973. Before long, she had some 40 accounts, ranging
from $20,000 to well over $1 million.
Dixon saw an uncomplicated genius in Donchian’s trading:
“I’m not a mathematician. I believe that the simple solution
is the most elegant and the best. Nobody has ever been able
to demonstrate to me that a complex mathematical
equation can answer the question, ‘Is the market moving in
an uptrend, downtrend, or sideways.’ Any better than
looking at a price chart and having simple rules to define
those three sets of circumstances. These are the same rules
I used back in the late 70s.”105
Donchian was, once again, ahead of his time when he taught the
critical importance of fast and simple decision making, a subject
covered in Chapter 7, “Decision Making.”
Dixon was fond of pointing out that a good system is one that
keeps you alive and keeps your equity intact when there are no
trends. She explained that the reason for any system is to get you
into the market when a trend establishes itself. Her message is
clear: “[D]on’t give up the system, even after a string of losses…that
is important because that’s just when the profits are due.”106
Dixon doesn’t attempt to predict price moves, nor expect to be
right every time. She knows she can’t forecast the top or bottom of
a price move. The hope is that it continues indefinitely because you
expect to make money over the long run, but on individual trades,
you admit when you’re wrong and move on.107
Today, most people fixate on the new and fresh fast money idea
of the day, yet I still find almost every word Donchian (or Dixon)
wrote newer, fresher, and more honest than anything currently
broadcast on CNBC. My favorite Donchian wisdom tackles an issue
that people are still struggling with in 2009:
“It doesn’t matter if you’re trading stocks or soybeans.
Trading is trading, and the name of the game is increasing
your wealth. A trader’s job description is stunningly simple:
Don’t lose money. This is of utmost importance to new
traders, who are often told do your research. This is good

advice, but should be considered carefully. Research alone
won’t ensure a profit, and at the end of the day, your main
goal should be to make money, not to get an A in How to
Read a Balance Sheet.”
Donchian’s blunt talk may explain why Harvard’s finance
curriculum does not include mention of Dunn, Henry, Seykota,
Campbell, Parker, Abraham, or Donchian himself.

Jesse Livermore and Dickson Watts
Ed Seykota found wisdom and inspiration through the work of
Richard Donchian. But who else influenced trend followers? How
long ago did this style of trading start? Trend followers would point
to Jesse Livermore, an early twentieth-century stock and
commodity trader, who traded as a trend follower long before the
term existed.
Livermore was born in South Acton, Massachusetts in 1877. At
the age of 15, he went to Boston and began working in Paine
Webber’s Boston brokerage office. He studied price movements and
began to trade their price fluctuations. When Livermore was in his
20s, he moved to New York City to speculate in the stock and

commodities markets. After 40 years of trading, he developed a
knack for speculating on price movements. One of his foremost
rules was, “Never act on tips.”
The unofficial biography of Livermore was Reminiscences of a
Stock Operator first published in 1923 and written by journalist
Edwin Lefevre. Readers likely guessed Lefevre as a pseudonym for
Livermore himself. Reminiscences of a Stock Operator went on to
become a Wall Street classic. Numerous quotations and
euphemisms from the book are so embedded in trading lore that
traders today don’t have the slightest idea of their origination. I’ve
selected a few of his best:108

mistakes. They say there are two sides to everything. But there
is only one side to the stock market; and it is not the bull side

2. “I think it was a long step forward in my trading education
when I realized at last that when old Mr. Partridge kept on
telling the other customers, ‘Well, you know this is a bull
market!’ he really meant to tell them that the big money was
not in the individual fluctuations but in the main movements—
that is, not in reading the tape, but in sizing up the entire
market and its trend.”
3. “The reason is that a man may see straight and clearly and yet
become impatient or doubtful when the market takes its time

5. “A man will risk half his fortune in the stock market with less
reflection than he devotes to the selection of a medium-priced
automobile.”
Think about the wild speculation that took place during the dot-
com bubble of the late 1990s, the wild speculation that ended with
the October 2008 market crash, and then remember Livermore was
referring to the market environment of 75 years ago, not today.
Livermore did write one book: How to Trade in Stocks: The
Livermore Formula for Combining Time, Element, and Price. It
was published in 1940. The book is rare and difficult to find, but a
little persistence paid off for me. Livermore was by no means a
perfect trader (and he says so). He was no role model. His trading
style was bold and extremely volatile. He went broke several times
making and losing millions. That said, his personal trading
performance does not detract from the wisdom of his words.
Was Livermore the first trend follower? I doubt it. One trader
who had an influence on Livermore was Dickson Watts. Watts was
president of the New York Cotton Exchange between 1878 and
1880, yet his words are as relevant as ever:
“What is speculation? All business is more or less
speculation. The term speculation, however, is commonly
restricted to business of exceptional uncertainty. The
uninitiated believe that chance is so large a part of
speculation that it is subject to no rules, is governed by no
laws. This is a serious error. Let us first consider the
qualities essential to the equipment of a speculator:
1. Self-reliance: A man must think for himself, must
follow his own convictions. Self-trust is the
foundation of successful effort.
2. Judgment: That equipoise, that nice adjustment of
the facilities one to the other, which is called good
judgment, is an essential to the speculator.
3. Courage: That is, confidence to act on the decisions
of the mind. In speculation, there is value in
Mirabeau’s dictum: Be bold, still be bold; always be
bold.

==================================================

Chapter 2 • Great Trend Followers 93
4. Prudence: The power of measuring the danger,
together with a certain alertness and watchfulness,
is important. There should be a balance of these
two, prudence and courage; prudence in
contemplation, courage in execution. Connected
with these qualities, properly an outgrowth of them,
is a third, viz: promptness. The mind convinced, the
act should follow. Think, act, promptly.
5. Pliability: The ability to change an opinion, the
power of revision. ‘He who observes,’ says Emerson,
‘and observes again, is always formidable.’
“The qualifications named are necessary to the makeup of
a speculator, but they must be in well-balanced
combination. A deficiency or an over plus of one quality
will destroy the effectiveness of all. The possession of such
faculties, in a proper adjustment is, of course, uncommon.
In speculation, as in life, few succeed, many fail.”110
Ultimately, people want to know why trend following keeps
working. Livermore’s words from another time answer that question
for our time:
“Wall Street never changes, the pockets change, the
suckers change, the stocks change, but Wall Street never
changes, because human nature never changes.”
Key Points
• Trend followers are not lucky. They are prepared for the
unexpected.
• Trend followers take what the market offers in the moment.
They don’t predict the future.
• Making money requires that you be able to live with and accept
volatility.

Absolute Returns
An absolute return trading strategy simply means that you are
trying to make the most money possible without being limited to a
linkage to an index such as the S&P. Author Alexander Ineichen
explains:
“An absolute return manager is essentially an asset
manager without a benchmark—Bench marking can be
viewed as a method of restricting investment managers so
as to limit the potential for surprises, either positive or
negative.”2
Trend followers don’t track or attempt to mimic any particular
index in their trading—ever. If trend followers had a coat of arms,
“Absolute Returns” would be emblazoned upon it. They thrive and
profit from the “surprises” that benchmarking by its nature
artificially stops.
This ain’t clipping Are all trend followers shooting for absolute returns and the
coupons. No risk, most amount of money possible? No, not all play the game full tilt.
noreturn. Jerry Parker, a good trend follower, purposefully aims for lower
Anonymous returns to cater to a different client base (those who want less risk
and hence less return).
Trend trader John W. Henry has long made the case for his
absolute return strategy:
“JWH’s overall objective is to provide absolute returns. JWH
is an absolute return manager, insofar as it does not manage
against a natural benchmark. Relative return managers,
such as most traditional equity or fixed income managers,
are measured on how they perform relative to some pre-
determined benchmark. JWH has no such investment
benchmark, so its aim is to achieve returns in all market
conditions, and is thus considered an absolute return
manager.”3
Shoot for a benchmark in return, and you run with the crowd.
Benchmarks such as the S&P might make people feel safe, even
when that feeling is clearly artificial. Trend followers, on the other
hand, understand that trading for absolute returns and not from

blind adherence to benchmarks is the best way to handle
uncertainty.
The concept of indexing and benchmarking is very useful in the
world of traditional, long-only investing, but it has limited
usefulness for absolute return investing. Again, it gets back to the
notion of what it takes to achieve an absolute return—portfolio
managers need to have an enormous amount of latitude and
freedom in the execution of their trading strategy to ensure capital
preservation and achieve a positive return. At its core, the concept
of absolute return investing is almost antithetical to benchmarking,
which encourages traditional managers to have similarly structured

Fear of Volatility and Confusion with Risk
There are organizations that rank and track monthly
performance numbers. One organization givesa “star ranking” (like
Morningstar):
“The quantitative rating system employed ranks and rates
the performance of all commodity trading advisors
(CTA)…Ratings are given in four categories: a) equity, b)
performance, c) risk exposure, and d) risk-adjusted returns.
In each category, the highest possible rating is five stars and
the lowest possible rating is one star. The actual statistics
on which the percentiles are based as follows:
1. Performance: Rate of Return
2. Risk: Standard Deviation
3. Risk Adjusted: Sharpe Ratio
4. Equity: Assets”5

Volatility is the tendency Dunn Capital receives one star for “risk,” the implication being
for prices to change that an investment with Dunn is risky. However, do these rankings
unexpectedly.7
give accurate information on Dunn’s true risk? This rating group
uses standard deviation as their measure of risk. But is this a
measure of volatility and not necessarily risk. High volatility alone
does not necessarily mean higher risk.
It’s doubtful that Dunn is too concerned about being penalized
with this measurement, but using standard deviation as a risk
measurement simply distorts critical issues.
The ranking of infamous trader Victor Niederhoffer demon-
strates a great example of the star system weakness. At the time of
Niederhoffer’s public-trading demise in 1997 (more on Niederhoffer
in Chapter 4, “Big Events, Crashes, and Panics”), he was rated as
four stars for “risk.” Based on the past performance of Niederhoffer,
the rankings were saying that he was a much “safer bet” than Dunn.
Obviously, the star system failed for people who believed
Niederhoffer was less “risky.” Standard deviation as a risk measure
has done trend followers an injustice. One of my goals is to dispel
the simplistic notion that trend following is “just risky” or that they
“all have high standard deviations,” which means they are “bad.”

102 Trend Following (Updated Edition): Learn to Make Millions in Up or Down Markets
However, volatility (what standard deviation measures) is still a
four-letter word for most market participants. Volatility scares
people; even when a freshman student can quickly analyze any
historical data series of any market or trend follower and see that
volatility is normal, many investors run away from a hint of
volatility (even when running is not even possible). Of course, some
markets and traders are more volatile than others, but degrees of
volatility are a basic fact of life. To trend followers, volatility is the
precursor to profit. No volatility equals no opportunity for profit.
The press is just as confused with the concept of volatility as
seen in this excerpt from Business Week:
“Trend followers are trying to make sense out of their
dismal recent returns. ‘When you look past the superficial
question of how we did, you look under the hood and see
immense change in the global markets,’ says John W.
Henry’s president. ‘Volatility is just a harbinger of new
trends to come.’ Maybe. But futures traders are supposed to
make money by exploiting volatility. Performance isn’t a
‘superficial question’ if you were among the thousands of
commodity-fund customers who lost money when the
currency markets went bonkers.”8
Focusing on one time period in isolation while ignoring a
complete performance history does not present the full picture. I
wondered if this reporter had written a follow-up article correcting
his observations about trend following since the following year

Chapter 3 • Performance Data 103
What does this mean? Trend following performance is unfairly
penalized by performance measures such as the Sharpe ratio. The
Sharpe ratio does not care whether volatility is on the plus or the
minus side because it does not account for the difference between
the standard deviation and the semi-standard deviation. The actual
formula for calculating them is identical, with one exception, the
semi-standard deviation looks only at observations below the mean.
If the semi-standard deviation is lower than the standard deviation,
the historical pull away from the mean has to be on the plus side. If
it is higher, the pull away from the mean is on the minus side.
Meaden points out the huge difference that puts trend following
volatility on the upside if you compare monthly standard (12.51)
and semi-standard (5.79) deviation.10
Here is another way of thinking about upside volatility: Ponder Trading is a zero-sum

upside volatility in action. losses of the losers.12
Trend followers have greater upside volatility and less downside
volatility than traditional equity indices such as the S&P because
they exit losing trades quickly with preset stop losses. This means
they have many small loses as they constantly try to see if an entry
into a market pans out into a big trend.
Michael Rulle, president of Graham Capital, helps to mitigate
volatility fears:
“A trend follower achieves positive returns by correctly
targeting market direction and minimizing the cost of this
portfolio. Thus, while trend following is sometimes referred
to as being ‘long volatility,’ trend followers technically do
not trade volatility, although they often benefit from it.”11
The question, then, is not how to reduce volatility (you can’t
control the market after all), but how to manage it through proper
position sizing or money management.
Bottom line, you have to get used to riding the bucking bronco.
Great trend traders don’t see straight up equity curves in their
accounts, so you are in good company when it comes to the up and
down nature of making money.

John W. Henry makes the clear distinction between volatility
and risk:
“…Risk is very different from volatility. A lot of people
believe there is no difference, but there’s a huge difference
and I can spend an hour on that topic. Suffice it to say that
we embrace both volatility and risk and, for us, risk is that
we’re going to lose if we risk two tenths of one percent on a
particular trade. That is, to us, real risk. Giving back a
profit to you probably seems like risk, to us it seems like
volatility.”
Some people seem to like Henry’s long-term world-view doesn’t avoid high volatility. The

a major trend before he can make big profits. DineshDesai, a trend
EdSeykota14
follower from the 1980s, was fond of saying that he loved volatility.
Being on the right side of a volatile market was the source of his
profits.
However, the skeptics mistakenly view high volatility, the
engine that drives trend following’s spectacular returns, as
consistently negative. For example, a fund manager who manages
$1.5 billion in assets remains on the sidelines refusing to believe in
trend following:
“My biggest source of hesitancy about the asset class [trend
following] is its reliance on technical analysis. Trading
advisors do seem to profit, but because they rarely
incorporate economic data, they simply ride price trends
until they reverse. The end result of this crude approach is
a subpar return to risk ratio.” Another money manager
opines: “Why should I give money to a AA baseball player
when I can hire someone in the major leagues?”13
How can one look at the absolute performance of great trend
traders and call it AA baseball? I wonder if this manager still exists
following October 2008? Weren’t the funds and banks that blew out
all considered Major League? If you can get beyond the majority’s
irrational fear of volatility, you can learn how volatility really
matters. Trend follower JasonRussell states for him when volatility
starts:

lose all confidence and throw in the towel. Traders,
portfolio managers, and mathematicians seem well

Russell’s comments, however, don’t mean people easily accept
his wisdom. Trend trader David Harding has seen the persistent
confusion. He was recently asked: “You’ve attracted quite a lot of
new money into the fund since you’ve launched, but particularly in
the last couple of years. Why?”
Harding replied: “I think that the market has bought what

Drawdowns
With volatility comes the inevitable drawdown. What do I
mean? A drawdown is any losing period during an investment
record. It is defined as the percent retrenchment from an equity
peak to an equity valley. A drawdown is in effect from the time an
equity retrenchment begins until a new equity high is reached, i.e.,
in terms of time, a drawdown encompasses both the period from
equity peak to equity valley (length) and the time from the equity
valley to a new equity high (recovery).15
For example, if you start from $100,000 and drop to $50,000,
you are in a 50 percent drawdown. You could also just say that you
have lost 50 percent. Thus, the drawdown is just a reduction in
account equity.

and risk management.19 leads to the recovery conversation, which simply means bringing
capital back to the point where a drawdown began. Historically,
trend followers quickly make money back during recovery from
drawdowns.
However, you can’t neglect the math associated with losing
money and making it back. What if you start with $100 and it drops
to $50? You are now in a 50 percent drawdown. How much do you
have to make just to get back to breakeven (Chart 3.3)? One
hundred percent. That’s right, when you go down 50 percent, you
need to make back 100 percent to get to breakeven again.
Notice that as drawdown increases (see Chart 3.3), the percent
gain necessary to recover to the breakeven point increases at a
much faster rate. Trend followers live with this chart daily. Their
strategy is designed to deal with the following math:

Correlation
Correlation comparisons help to show that trend following is a

112 Trend Following (Updated Edition): Learn to Make Millions in Up or Down Markets
among trend followers. Correlation is not only important in
assembling the portfolio you trade (see Chapter 9, “Holy Grails”),
but it is a critical tool to analyze and compare performance
histories of trend followers. Unlike misguided comparisons, such as
using standard deviation, I find correlation comparisons of
performance data useful.
In a research paper titled “Learning to Love Non-Correlation,”
correlation is defined as “a statistical term giving the strength of
linear relationship between two random variables. It is the
historical tendency of one thing to move in tandem with another.”
The correlation coefficientis a number from –1 to +1, with –1 being
the perfectly opposite behavior of two investments (for example, up
5 percent every time the other is down 5 percent). The +1 reflects
identical investment results (up or down the same amount each
period). The further away from +1 one gets (and thus closer to –1),
the better a diversifier one investment is for the other. But because
his firm is keenly aware of keeping things simple, it also provides
another description of correlation: the tendency for one investment
to “zig” while another “zags.”27
I took the monthly performance numbers of trend followers and
computed their correlation coefficients. Comparing correlations
provided evidence that trend followers trade typically the same
markets in the same way at the same time.
Look at the correlation chart (see Chart 3.5) and ask yourself:
“Why do two trend followers who don’t work in the same office, who
are on opposite sides of the continent, have the same three losing
months in a row with similar percentage losses?” Then ask: “Why
do they have the same winning month, then the same two losing
months, and then the same three winning months in a row?” The
relationship is there because they can respond only to what the
market offers. The market offers trends to everyone equally.
They’re all looking at the same market aiming for the same target of
opportunity.
Does Chart 3.5 mean trend followers are using similar
techniques? Absolutely.

Surprisingly, correlation can be a touchy subject for some trend
followers. The Turtles (see Chapter 2) were all grateful to Richard
Dennis for his mentoring, but some seemed to become ambivalent
over time, obviously indebted to Dennis but struggling to achieve
their own identity:
“[One Turtle] says his system is 95 percent Dennis’ system
and the rest his ‘own flair…I’m a long way from someone
who follows the system mechanically…but by far, the
structure of what I do is based on Richard’s systems, and
certainly, philosophically, everything I do in terms of
trading is based on what I learned from Richard.’”28
Even when correlation data still shows similar patterns of
trading among Dennis’ Turtle students, the desire to differentiate
themselves from each other is stronger than their need to honestly
address obvious similarities in their return streams:

“There no longer is a turtle trading style in my mind. We’ve
all evolved and developed systems that are very different
from those we were taught, and that independent evolution
suggests that the dissimilarities to trading between turtles
are always increasing.”29
A Turtle correlation chart paints a clear picture. The
relationship is solid. The data (Chart 3.6) is the judge:

positive performance correlation. Consequently, values exceeding –0.66 might be
viewed as having significant negative performance correlation.

Of course, there is more to the story than just correlation.
Although correlations show the Turtles trade in similar ways, their
returns can also differ because of their individual leverage choices.
Some traders use more leverage, whereas others, such as Jerry
Parker, use less. Parker explains, “The bigger the trade, the greater
the returns and the greater the drawdowns. It’s a double-edged
sword.”30
Zero Sum Nature of the Markets
Zero-sum trading is arguably the most important concept in
this chapter. Larry Harris, chair in Finance at the Marshall School
of Business at University of Southern California, gets to the crux of
the matter:



==================================================
                     PAGE 142

“Trading is a zero-sum game when gains and losses are If you get people asking
measured relative to the market average. In a zero-sum the wrong questions, you
don’t have to worry about
game, someone can win only if somebody else loses.”31
the answers.
Another good explanation of zero sum is found in “The Winners HunterS. Thompson
and Losers of the Zero-Sum Game: The Origins of Trading Profits,
Price Efficiency and Market Liquidity,” a white paper authored by
Harris. In speaking with Harris, he told me that he was amazed at
how many people came from the TurtleTrader.com website to his
site to download his white paper on zero-sum trading.
In brief, Harris examines what factors determine who wins and
who loses when trading. He does this by categorizing traders by
type and then evaluating their trading styles to determine whether
the styles lead to profits or losses. Harris adds:
“Winning traders can only profit to the extent that other
traders are willing to lose. Traders are willing to lose when
they obtain external benefits from trading. The most
important external benefits are expected returns from
holding risky securities that represent deferred consump-
tion. Hedging and gambling provide other external benefits.
Markets would not exist without utilitarian traders. Their
trading losses fund the winning traders who make prices
efficient and provide liquidity.”32
There are those who absolutely do not accept that there must
be a loser for them to be a winner. They cannot live with the idea
that everyone can’t win. Although they want to win, many do not
want to live with the guilt that by their winning, someone else has
to lose. This is a poorly thought out, yet an all too common view of
the mindset of a losing trader.
What separates winnersfrom losers? Harris was clear: “On any
given transaction, the chances of winning or losing may be near
even. In the long run, however, winners profit from trading because
they have some persistent advantages that allow them to win
slightly more often (or occasionally much bigger) than losers
win.”33
For anyone who has ever played poker or studied “edges” in
gambling, Harris’ words ring true:



==================================================
                     PAGE 143                     
==================================================

“To trade profitably in the long run, you must know your
edge, you must know when it exists, and you must focus
your trading to exploit it when you can. If you have no edge,
you should not trade for profit. If you know you have no
edge, but you must trade for other reasons, you should
organize your trading to minimize your losses to those who
do have an edge. Recognizing your edge is a prerequisite to
predicting whether trading will be profitable.”34
The noted finance professor RobertSamuelson adds, “For every
trader betting on higher prices, another is betting on lower prices.
These trades are matched. In the stock market, all investors
(buyers and sellers) can profit in a rising market, and all can lose in
a falling market. In futures markets, one trader’s gain is another’s
loss.”
In “The Gartman Letter,” Dennis Gartman clarifies the
situation even more: “In the world of futures speculation, for every
long there is an equal and opposite short. That is, unlike the world
of equity trading where there needn’t be equal numbers of longs
versus shorts, in the world of futures dealing there is. Money is
neither made, nor lost, in futures; it is simply moved from one
pocket to the next as margins are swapped at the close of trading
each day. Thus, every time there is a buyer betting that prices shall
rise in the future, there is an equal seller taking the very opposite
‘bet,’ betting that prices will fall.”
These observations will save your skin if you’re willing to accept
them, but as you can see throughout this chapter and the next,
many traders are either ignorant of zero-sum thinking, choose to
ignore it, or refuse to believe it.
George Soros and Zero Sum
The success of famed trader George Soros is well known.
He is the best-known hedge fund manager. In 1992 he was
called ‘the man who broke the British Pound’ for placing $10 billion
in bets against the British pound that netted him at least $1 billion
in profit.35
That said, even really smart guys sometimes miss the key point.
Years back, Soros appeared on Nightline, the ABC news program.

important to realize…”
Ted Koppel: “Well, it’s not zero sum in terms of investors. But,
for example, when you bet against the British pound that was not
good for the British economy?”
George Soros: “Well, it happened to be quite good for the
British economy. It was not, let’s say, good for the British treasury
because they were on the other side of the trade…It’s not—your
gain is not necessarily somebody else’s loss.”
Ted Koppel: “Because—I mean put it in easily understandable
terms—I mean if you could have profited by destroying Malaysia’s
currency, would you have shrunk from that?”
George Soros: “Not necessarily because that would have been
an unintended consequence of my action. And it’s not my job as a
participant to calculate the consequences. This is what a market is.
That’s the nature of a market. So I’m a participant in the market.”
Soros opens a can of worms with his view on zero sum. Here’s
an online weblog post that incorrectly analyzes Soros’ interview.
The poster argues:
“Cosmetically, Koppel wipes the floor with Soros. He’s able
to portray Soros as a person who destroys lives and
economies without a second thought, as well as simplify,
beyond belief, something that should not be simplified.”36
This is nonsense. The fact that Soros is a player in the market
does not establish him as a destroyer of lives. You might disagree
with Soros’ political ideology, but you can’t question his morality for
participation in the market. Do you have a 401k plan designed to
generate profits from the market? Of course you do, just like Soros.
Others, such as Lawrence Parks, a union activist, correctly
states that Soros is in a zero-sum game, but gets sidetracked by
declaring zero sum unfair and harsh for the “working man”:

Parks argues that the only choice he has been given is to lose.
He loses; his union loses. It seems everyone loses in the zero-sum
game. Of course, there are winners and he knows that. The zero-
sum game is, indeed, a wealth transfer. The winners profit from the
losers. Parks correctly describes the nature of the zero-sum game,
but positions the game in terms of morality. Life is not fair. If you
don’t like being a loser in the zero-sum game, perhaps it is time to
consider how the winners play the game.
Although it might appear that I am defending Soros, I am not.
The market is a zero-sum game. Trying to understand Soros’
reasons for denying this would be speculation on my part. Soros is
not always a zero-sum winner either. Soros was on the losing side
of the zero-sum game during the Long Term Capital Management
fiasco in 1998. He lost $2 billion. (I discuss this in more detail in
Chapter 4.) He also had severe trouble in the 2000 technology
meltdown:

These wins and losses seem to have taken a toll on Soros:
“Maybe I don’t understand the market. Maybe the music has
stopped but people are still dancing. I am anxious to reduce my
market exposure and be more conservative. We will accept lower
returns because we will cut the risk profile.”40
I don’t see evidence that the market has changed. Nor has the
zero-sum game of the markets changed. However, something might
have changed within George Soros.

class action suits clearly illustrates the concept of zero sum. He

handful of lucky winners. Those few lucky winners, who are
not before the Court, now hold the monies that the unlucky
plaintiffs have lost, fair and square, and they will never
return those monies to plaintiffs. Had plaintiffs themselves
won the game instead of losing, they would have owed not
a single penny of their winnings to those they left to hold
the bag (or to defendants).”41
A 96-year-old judge bluntly telling the plaintiffs to take
responsibility for their own actions might have been painful reading
for investors who were following the case hoping for a bailout.

market process by using the legal process. He is basically saying
that there would be no free lunch.
The harsh reality of the markets is that you only have yourself
to blame for the decisions you make with your money. You can
make losing decisions or winning decisions. It’s your choice.
David Druz, a student of Ed Seykota and a longtime trend
follower, takes Judge Pollack’s ruling a step further and spells out
the practical effects of the market’s zero-sum nature:
If all it took to beat the “Everyone who enters the market thinks they will win, but

BillDries43 thinks he’s going to be right, too.”
The market is a brutal place. Forget trying to be liked. Need a
friend? Get a dog. The market doesn’t know you and never will. If
you are going to win, someone else has to lose. Don’t like these
survival-of-the-fittest rules? Then stay out of the zero-sum game.
Key Points
• Trend followers always prepare for drawdowns after strong
periods of performance.
• An absolute return strategy means you are trying to make the
most money possible.
• The fact that markets are volatile is not a problem. The
problem is you if volatility scares you.
• Trading is a zero-sum game in an important accounting sense.
In a zero-sum game, the total gains of the winners are exactly
equal to the total losses of the losers.
• Trend followers go to the market to trade trends. However, not
all market players are trying to do the same thing. Fannie Mae
could be making a change in their bond portfolio. A major
investment bank could be trading a strategy that will not
tolerate volatility. The bottom line is that people trade for

different goals. George Crapple, a trend follower with 25+ years
in experience, makes the point: “So while it may be a zero-sum
game, a lot of people don’t care. It’s not that they’re stupid; it’s
not speculative frenzy; they’re just using these markets for a
completely different purpose.”

This chapter outlines high profile times where trend followers won

Wall Street is famous for corporate collapses or mutual and
hedge fund blow-ups that transfer capital from winners to losers and
back again. However, interestingly, the winners always seem to be
missing from the after-the-fact analysis of the mainstream media.
The press is fascinated with losers. Taking their lead from the press,
the public also gets caught up in the drama and narrative of the
losers, oblivious to the real story: Who are the winners and why?

Prominent academics in finance searching for winners also
come up short, as Christopher Culp of the University of Chicago
laments:
“It’s a zero-sum game. For every loser there’s a winner, but
you can’t always be specific about who the winner is.”3
When the big trading events happen, many people know the
losses are going somewhere, but after time passes, they stop
thinking about it. Reflecting on the unknown is not pleasant, as
author Alexander Ineichen notes:
“Fear is still in the bones of some pension fund trustees—

Barings Bank is probably the most often cited derivatives
disaster. While the futures market had been the instrument
used by Nick Leeson to play the zero-sum game [and]

Bill Eckhardt, John W. Henry, and Jerry Parker (to name a few)

during uncertain times:
“For markets to move in tandem, there has to be a common
perception or consensus about economic conditions that
drives it. When a major ‘event’ occurs in the middle of such
a consensus, such as the Russian debt default of August

1998, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, or the
corporate accounting scandals of 2002 [and the 2008
equity market crash], it will often accelerate existing trends
already in place…‘events’ do not happen in a vacuum…
This is the reason trend following rarely gets caught on the
wrong side of an ‘event.’ Additionally, the stop loss trading
style will limit exposure when it does—When this
consensus is further confronted by an ‘event,’ such as a
major country default, the ‘event’ will reinforce the crisis
mentality already in place and drive those trends toward
their final conclusion. Because trend following generally
can be characterized as having a ‘long option’ profile, it
typically benefits greatly when these occurrences
happen.”7

Superfund Annual Returns:

• 2001: 18.82% • 2008: 30.02%
• 2002: 38.42%
Not only trend following trader Superfund won big. Consider
other trend following traders during the same period:
1. One fund run by John W. Henry & Co., founded by Boston Red
Sox baseball-team owner John W. Henry, was up 72.4 percent
through October 2008.
2. TransTrend, a Dutch-based trend following trader managing
more than $1 billion in assets, saw one of its funds go up +71.75
percent from January 2008 through November 2008.
3. Clarke Capital Management Inc., led by MichaelClarke, saw its
$72.2 million fund gain 82.2 percent through October 2008.
Clarke, as but one example of his winning bets, shorted crude
oil when it was around $140, and then stayed with the trade
down to $80 before exiting, thereby collecting the bulk of the
trend. This is just one example of his winning bets.
4. Trend follower Bernard Drury started selling short S&P 500
index futures in November 2007. The index is down about 36
percent since and the largest Drury fund was up 56.9 percent
through October 2008.10
5. Paul Mulvaney, another trend following trader who has used a
much longer timeframe in his trading (weekly bars), saw his
fund post a 45.49 percent return for the month of October
2008—yes, in one month.
How did these numbers happen? What is the source of these
returns? For example, trend follower Superfund provided some
insights into its 2008 trading performance:

“October 2008 provides a prime example of how [we] can
produce gains in volatile and otherwise adverse market
conditions. During this month and preceding months, [our]
trading system not only profited from trends that were
gaining momentum, but also responded to historic volatility
by reducing or eliminating positions, and thus risk
exposure, in markets in which trends were growing stale.”
How did they do it? How did it work out like this? Superfund
explained to me:
“In February 2008, a sustaineddownward trend in the U.S.
dollar against various currencies accelerated. This coin-
cided with a significant rally in gold and energy markets.
Many trend following trading systems…profited from short
positions in the U.S. dollar [see Chart 4.1] and long
positions in gold and energies.”
CHART 4.1: U.S. Dollar Short Trade
Superfund described the continuing unfolding market chaos:
“At the same time, several world stocks indices exhibited
signs of weakness. By June, however, gold stumbled nearly
$200 from recent highs above $1,000 per ounce [see Chart
4.2]. [We were able] to continue capturing gains in the U.S.
dollar, energies, and stocks while reducing its long exposure
to gold as returns in this market faltered.”

132 Trend Following (Updated Edition): Learn to Make Millions in Up or Down Markets
Superfund, like most all trend followers, realized the bulk of
their October profits as a result of the ability to capitalize on a
variety of different market conditions while limiting losses based on
a combination of diversification, flexibility, risk management, and
discipline. While a substantial portion of trend following October
profits were derived from short positions in the stock indices and
world currencies, trend followers also realized profits from long
bond positions. They also avoided major losses by reducing
exposure to gold and energies.
Although not as large as more established trend following traders
in terms of assets under management, JustinVandergrift of Chadwick
Investment Group offered insights into his 2008 performance. He
took me through some of his trades where he saw monster returns at
a time when buy and holders were all gasping for air.
Vandergrift first outlined a European interest trade (see Chart
4.7): “In the midst of the global financial crisis,we received signals
on many short-term interest rates. The Euribor is a short-term
interest rate futures contract traded at the EUREX. We bought on
October 7 and are still long (through December 2008). Central
banks around the globe began dropping interest rates to ward off
equity market declines. Lower interest rates mean higher Euribor
futures prices. That said, fundamentals did not drive our decisions.”
CHART 4.7: December 2008 Euribor

==================================================

Chapter 4 • Big Events, Crashes, and Panics 133
Vandergrift explained how he profited from another short term
interest rate, the EuroSwiss (see Chart 4.8): “The EuroSwiss is
another short-term interest rate futures contract. We entered this
position well before the global equity market crash.”
CHART 4.8: December 2008 EuroSwiss
I know I perhaps sound redundant about how trend followers
don’t even care what markets they make money in, but it is a
critical point. Consider Vandergrift’s explanation about trading
“hogs” (see Chart 4.9): “The Hog position was one of the most
beautiful trends that I’ve seen in years. As the U.S. dollar rallied,
nearly every commodity tied to the dollar moved violently.
Although our larger portfolio gains happened in October, this
position profited throughout the fall of 2008.”
Sure, we all focus on “stocks,” but what about lumber?
Vandergrift explained his lumber trade (see Chart 4.10): “Lumber
was another great market over the fall of 2008. Lumber fell due to
the housing crisis in the U.S. Lower demand means lower
lumber prices. We sold the market short in the late summer and
held the position until mid-November. However, it is important to
keep in mind that we went short based off of price action, not
fundamentals.”

purchasing power in other currencies, pushing Robusta lower. My
fundamental views once again mean little, we just followed the
trend.”
CHART 4.11: January 2009 Robusta Coffee
Perhaps no other market than the U.S. dollar was more
important to trend followers. Once again, they did not care whether
they made money in the dollar going long or going short—they were
agnostic to the dollar’s direction (see Chart 4.12): “The trend up in
the U.S.dollar was cut into two segments. We saw more volatility in
this contract than others, simply due to the U.S. equity markets.
Although our entries and exits are tied to highs and lows in the U.S.
dollar futures, moves in the U.S. equity markets influenced the
price as well. The rise of this contract created opportunities in
many of the other markets we trade, because they are so closely
tied to the price of the dollar.”
All you can do as a trend follower is take what is given. The goal
is to make money in trending markets. The goal is not to fall in love
with one particular market to the exclusion of another market,
which is potentially a better opportunity.

Not only were there massive winners and losers in Enron stock,
but the zero-sum game sprang into full force during the California
energy crisis in late 2000 and during 2001. Enron was a primary
supplier of natural gas to California. California, bound by its own
flawed deregulation schemes, freely signed long-term contracts with

and Enron (see Chart 4.23), you have to question Feinstein’s basic
market understandings.
Why did California lock itself into stringent agreements with
firms such as Enron? Why did California, through its own deals,
trade outside typical market structures? Why couldn’t they deal
with a changing natural gas price? California must accept blame for
its dumb decisions.
Anyone at any time can trade natural gas at the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Anyone can hedge a natural gas position. The
opportunity to speculate and hedge is there for everyone. It is not a
novel concept. Of course, trend followers were playing the natural
gas game too, riding it up and down for profit, as Chart 4.25
demonstrates.

One Enron employee was frustrated by the entire sordid affair:
“My fellow (former) colleagues have no one to blame other than
themselves for allowing such disastrous losses to occur in their
retirement accounts. An abdication of personal responsibility
should not be rewarded. It is a sad consequence, but it is reality.”19
From private mutual fund companies such as Janus, to
retirement funds managed by state governments, no one had a plan
for exiting Enron. They all bought the stock, but incredibly selling
was never part of the plan. The Enron story is much more profound
than a tale of one company’s journey to disaster. It is the story of
inept individuals managing billions of retirement wealth.

rationalize their losses. However, the game doesn’t change, even if

An interesting aspect of the Enron fiasco was the close
relationship between the Enron share price and natural gas. To lose
money in Enron stock was essentially to lose money in natural gas.
They were connected at the hip. Enron acted like a derivative for
natural gas. The company presented mutual funds and pension
funds an opportunity to get into natural gas speculation even if their
mission statement might have limited them to stock speculation.
Using Enron as a proxy, mutual and pension funds were able to ride
natural gas to the top. Not only was everyone buying and holding
Enron, they were, for all intents and purposes, buying and holding
natural gas. The data makes the case.

be in the market was? Before considering September 11th
specifically, consider Ed Seykota’s words in general:
“A surprise is an event that catches someone unaware. If
you are already on the trend, the surprises seem to happen
to the other guys.”22
No one could have predicted that a terrorist attack would close
Wall Street for four days. Although it was difficult to stay focused on
the rigors of everyday life, trend followers maintained a sense of
balance. Unlike those investors who made trading decisions they
would not have made before September 11, trend followers
confronted the market as always. They dealt with it as they always
had—with a plan set in motion long before an unexpected event
happened.
Trend followers were short stocks and long bonds ahead of the
attack, because that was where those markets were already headed.
For example, Marty Ehrlich of Sunrise Capital Partners said how
lucky they were to be well positioned ahead of the September 11
attack. Jim Little, executive vice president for Campbell and Co.
makes the case that currency markets also followed through with
continued trends. “The (U.S.) dollar had already begun to weaken
before the attacks, hence Campbell was short that market.” He also
noted that Campbell had been long bonds and short a number of
global stock index futures contracts ahead of the attack because of
established trends.23
Their entries into positions were not triggered by actions on
September 11. Their decisions to be in or out of the market were
set in motion long before the unexpected event of September 11
happened. Although Enron, the California energy crisis, and
September 11 are vivid illustrations of the zero-sum game with
trend followers as the winners, the story of Long-Term Capital
Management in the summer of 1998 may be thebest trend following
case study.
Event #3: Long-Term Capital Management Collapse
Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) was a hedge fund that
went bust in 1998. The story of who lost has been told repeatedly
over the years; however, because trading is a zero-sum game,

==================================================

152 Trend Following (Updated Edition): Learn to Make Millions in Up or Down Markets
exploring the winners was the real story. LTCM is a classic saga of
the zero-sum game played out on a grand scale with trend followers
as winners.
“Trillion Dollar Bet,” a PBS special, described how LTCM came
to be. In 1973, three economists—Fischer Black, Myron Scholes,
and Robert Merton—discovered an elegant formula that
revolutionized modern finance. This mathematical Holy Grail, the
Black-Scholes Option Pricing Formula, was sparse and deceptively
simple. It earned Scholes and Merton a Nobel Prize and attracted
the attention of John Meriweather, the legendary bond trader of
Salomon Brothers.
LTCM promised to use complex mathematical models to make
investors wealthy beyond their wildest dreams. LTCM attracted the
elite of Wall Street’s investors and initially reaped fantastic profits
managing their money. Ultimately, their theories collided with
reality and sent the company spiraling out of control.24
Needless to say, this was not supposed to happen:
“They were immediately seen as a unique enterprise. They had
the best minds. They had a former vice chairman of the Federal
Reserve. They had John Meriwether…So they were seen by
individual investors, but particularly by banks and institutions that
went in with them, as a ticket to easy street.”25
The most damaging To understand the LTCM fiasco, we first need to take a quick
consequence of the LTCM
look at the foundations of modern finance. Merton Miller and his
episode is, therefore, the

In other words, Miller and Fama believed that perfectly rational
people would never pay more or less than any financial instrument
was actually worth. A fervent supporter of the Efficient Markets
Hypothesis, Myron Scholes was certain that markets could not
make mistakes. His associate, Robert Merton, took it a step further
with his continuous-time finance theory, which essentially wrapped
the finance universe into a supposed tidy ball.28

Chapter 4 • Big Events, Crashes, and Panics 153
Merton’s markets were as smooth as well brewed java, in which
prices would flow like cream. He assumed…that the price of a share
of IBM would never plunge directly from 80 to 60 but would always
stop at 79 3/4, 79 1/2, and 79 1/4 along the way.29
If LTCM’s universe was supposed to be “in a tidy ball,” it might
have been because where Merton and Scholes pioneered their
theories, academic life was tidy. LTCM’s founders believed the
market was a perfect normal distribution with no outliers, no fat
tails, and no unexpected events. Their problems began the moment
they accepted these assumptions.
After Merton, Scholes, and Meriwether had Wall Street
convinced that the markets were a nice, neat, and continuous
normal distribution, and there was no risk worth worrying about,
LTCM began using mammoth leverage for supposedly risk-free big
returns.
Approximately 55 banks gave LTCM financing, including

and Development described a single trade that exemplified LTCM’s
overall trading strategy. It was a bet on the convergence of yield
spreads between French bonds (OATs) and German bonds (bunds).
When the spread between the OATs and the bunds went to 60 basis
points in the forward market, LTCM decided to double its position.
That deal was only one leg of an even more complex convergence
bet, which included hedged positions in Spanish peseta and Italian
lira bonds.31
The result of all these complex convergences was that no one
had a clue what LTCM was up to, risk-wise, including LTCM. The
LTCM professors ran a secretive and closed operation so convoluted
that regulators and investors had no idea what, when, or how much
they were trading. Not being able to price an instrument or trade
freely in and out of it on a daily basis ignores what Wall Street calls

about how beautiful formulas could pose problems in the real world.
LTCM had the beautiful formulas; they were just not for the real
world. Eugene Fama, Scholes’ thesis advisor, had long held deep
reservations about his student’s options pricing model:

in global markets throughout August. We are down 44
percent for the month of August and 52 percent for the year
to date. Losses of this magnitude are a shock to us as they
surely are to you, especially in light of the historical
volatility of the fund.”38
At the time of Meriwether’s letter, LTCM’s history consisted of
only four short years, and although its “losses of this magnitude”
might have shocked LTCM, its clients, and the lender banks to
whom it owed over $100 billion, those trading losses became the
source of profits for trend followers. Amazingly, years later, Scholes
still seemed to have a problem with accepting personal
responsibility for his action in the zero-sum game:
“In August of 1998, after the Russian default, you know, all
the relations that tended to exist in a recent past seemed to
disappear.”39
Ultimately, the Fed, along with major world banks, most of
which were heavily vested in LTCM, bailed the firm out. I believe
that if this bailout was not allowed to happen, we might not have
had the events of October 2008 unfold, which included bailouts that
made LTCM look like a walk in the park. The LTCM bailout stopped
normal market forces. It set in motion the events of the next 10
years, culminating in the fall of 2008.

G.K. Chesterton44 his firm from LTCM:
• Transparent—By and large, trend followers trade markets on
regulated exchanges. They are not cooking up new derivatives
in their basements. Trend followers typically trade on freely
traded markets where a price that everyone can see enables
anyone to buy or sell. Trend followers have nothing in common
with the derivatives fiascos that damaged Orange County or
Proctor and Gamble.
• Understandable—Trend following strategies can be understood
by just about anybody. No high-level math that only PhDs can
comprehend.
• No rock stars—There are individuals who not only want to
make money, but also want a rock star as their portfolio
manager. They want to think that the strategy being used to
make them money is exciting and state-of-the-art. Trend
followers are not in the game for notoriety, just to win.
Debate continues about whether it was proper for the
government to step in and save LTCM. Indeed, what would have

happened (and how much more money would trend followers have
made) if LTCM had been allowed to properly implode?
I asked Dunn Capital Managementwhether they thought it was
proper that the Fed helped bail out LTCM. DanielDunn replied with
a one-word answer: “No.” When I asked Bill Dunn, he opined:
“I believe the Long-Term Capital Management collapse was
caused by:
1. Their trading approach was based on the theory that
prices and relationships between prices tend to vary, but
they also tend to return to their mean value over long
periods of time. So in practice, they probably looked at
a market (or a spread between markets) and determined
what its mean value was and where the current price
was in relation to their estimate of its ‘true mean’ value.
If the current price was below the mean, a ‘buy’ was
indicated, and if it was above the mean, a ‘sell’ was
indicated. (I don’t know what their exit strategy was.)
2. The main problem with the above is that as market
prices move further against your position, you will be
experiencing losses in your open positions and your
above trading approach would suggest that adding to the
current position will prove to be even more profitable
than originally expected. Unless this market very
quickly turns and starts its anticipated return to its
mean, additional losses will be suffered and the
potential for profit will seem to become even greater,
although elusive.
3. This problem can only be overcome by either adopting
a strict entry and exit strategy that is believed to
promote survivability or by having a nearly unlimited
amount of capital/credit to withstand the occasional
extreme excursions from the mean, or better yet, adopt
both of these ideas.
4. But the situation became even more unstable when
LTCM ventured into highly illiquid investment vehicles
and also became a very major part of these very thin
markets.

5. In the end, they became overextended and they ran out
of capital before any anticipated reversion to the mean
could bail them out.”
Investors who cannot or will not learn from the past could be
setting themselves up for another August–September 1998. Another
LTCM fiasco might be in the offing if the Black-Scholes way of life,
where the world is a normal distribution, is still considered a viable
approach to investing. Philip Anderson, a Nobel Prize Recipient in
Physics, sees the dangers that come from thinking in terms of
normal distributions:
“Much of the real world is controlled as much by the ‘tails’
of distributions as by means or averages: by the excep-
tional, not the mean; by the catastrophe, not the steady
drip; by the very rich, not the ‘middle class.’ We need to
free ourselves from ‘average’ thinking.”45
Breaking out from average thinking results in hitting home runs
(trend followers) instead of attempting and failing to slap those
supposed sure-fire singles (LTCM).
A footnote: Myron Scholes went on to form a new fund called
Platinum Grove after LTCM’s demise. With Scholes as Chairman,
Platinum Grove lost $600 million dollars during 2007–2008 during
the credit market meltdown. How many funds does this particular
financial genius have to blow up before the genius tag should be
taken away?
Event #4: Asian Contagion
The Asian crisis of 1997, also referred to as the Asian
Contagion, was yet another big event where trend followers won.
One of the biggest losers during the fall of 1997 was the infamous
trader Victor Niederhoffer. Always opinionated, bombastic, and for
most of his trading career, exceptionally successful, Niederhoffer’s
trading demise was swift.
Niederhoffer played a big game, whether at speculating, chess,
or squash. He challenged grandmasters in chess, and he won
repeated titles as a national squash champion. He regularly bet
hundreds of millions of dollars and consistently won until Monday,

with you, the funds suffered substantial losses earlier in the
year as a result of the collapse in the East Asian markets, espe-

the situation where, at the close of business on Monday, the

are that the entire equity positions in the funds has been wiped

liquidating most of the funds’ accounts for one more day, a liq-
uidation could have been avoided. Nevertheless, we cannot
deal with “would have been.” We took risks. We were success-
ful for a long time. This time we did not succeed, and I regret to
say that all of us have suffered some very large losses.49
Niederhoffer seems unable to acknowledge that he, alone, was
to blame for his losses in the zero-sum game. He did it. No one else
did it for him and he can’t use the unexpected as his excuse.

I have a hard time understanding how, after reviewing the
month-by-month performance histories of numerous trend
following traders that Niederhoffer sees their returns as “due to
chance.”
Niederhoffer goes on to question trend following: “No test of
‘the trend is your friend’ is possible, because the rule is never put
forward in the form of a testable hypothesis. Something is always
slippery, subjective, or even mystical about the rule’s interpretation
and execution.”57
Even though the performance data is clear, in his most recent
book Niederhoffer still didn’t “get it:”
“In my dream, I am long IBM, or priceline.com, or worst of
all, Krung Thai Bank, the state owned bank in Thailand that
fell from $200 to pennies while I held in 1997. The rest of

The majority of traders do not have the discipline to plan 3, 6,
and 12 months ahead for unforeseen changes in markets. However,
planning for the unexpected is an essential ingredient of trend
following. Big moves are always on the horizon if you are simply
reacting to the market and not trying to predict it.
Why do many people miss the big events and consequently the
big trends? Most traders make decisions on their perceptions of
what the market direction will be. After they make their directional
choice, they become blinded to any other option. They keep
searching for any type of validation to support their analysis even if
they are losing money—just like Nick Leeson. Before the Kobe
earthquake in early January 1995, with the Nikkei trading in a
range of 19,000 to 19,500, Leeson had long futures positions of
approximately 3,000 contracts on the Osaka Stock Exchange. After
the Kobe earthquake of January 17, his build up of Nikkei positions
intensified and Leeson just kept buying as the Nikkei sank.62

Observe the Nikkei 225 (see Chart 4.37) from September 1994

disciplined trend following traders.

There might be slight differences in leverage and signal timing,
but even from a quick glance it is clear: Big trends equaled big
profits at the same time for all trend followers. Henry confirmed in
1998, albeit cryptically, his massive zero-sum Barings win:

mess it was involved in after a New York arm, MG Refining
Marketing Inc. (MGRM), produced what its chief lenders considered
reckless losses in its energy-trading operations. In 1993, steep
margin debt calls contributed significantly to MG’s loss of $1.5
billion (2.3 billion Deutsche marks at the time). Just before
collapsing, the company was bailed out by German banks.65
What happened?
MG was long crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile
Exchange (NYMEX) through most of 1993. During that time period,
MG lost, depending on the estimate or source, $1.3 to $2.1 billion.
Because trading is a zero-sum game, those traders in short crude oil
futures made the money MG lost. They were the winners, and they
were trend followers.
During the course of 1993, crude oil futures (see Chart 4.40)
slowly declined from May through December.

putting extensive pressure on MG. What the academics never found
out or never seemed to be interested in finding out was who those
professional traders were. The performance data was out there for
everybody to look at. It wasn’t a secret.
Every day, trend followers knew how many contracts or shares
to trade based on total capital at that time. For example, after they
initiated positions and were rewarded with strong profits in July,
they were willing to risk those profits again, which is what they did.
In August, with nice profits in hand, they were willing to risk those
profits and still lose a fixed percentage based on their original stops.
They were willing to let profits on the table turn into losses. They
let the market tell them when the trend was over (January 1994).
In the fall of 1993, trend followers continued to hold their
established short positions in crude oil futures. MG was long crude
oil futures and desperately trying to stay afloat while trend followers
waited like predators. However, trend followers were not just short;
they were aggressively short, reinvesting their profits back into
additional short crude oil positions as the market decreased more
and more.
On the losing side of this zero-sum game, MG had no apparent
strategy. They refused to take a loss early on. In fact, the whole MG
affair would have been a footnote in trading history if they had

simply exited after the July price decline. However, instead, MG
stayed in the game in hopes of an upward trend to make up for
losses. But MG had no inkling of the steely discipline of their
opponents. Not one of the trend followers was going to exit anytime
soon. The price told them the trend was down. An exit would have
violated one of their most fundamental rules: let winners run.
Crude oil began its final descent in late November into
December. At this time, MG management liquidated all positions
and further fueled the November and December crude price drop.

Trend follower Jerry Parker outlined a clear and coherent view
of why fundamental analysis played no role in the trading of trend
followers:
“Fundamental analysis that excluded the possibility of an
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in the summer of 1990 would have
been incomplete and possibly unprofitable, or worse. This
was the only ‘fundamental’ that was worth knowing, yet was
the very one that almost no one could have known.
Technical analysis relies upon the idea that smart money
will move into a market and give advance warning that a
position should be taken. This often occurs when the true
major fundamentals are unknown.”72
The events presented in this chapter should leave everyone
with one inescapable conclusion: One of the main reasons that

such huge home runs, trend followers would have had a terrible
year. For those people who judge trading success by “quarters,”
trend followers were dead the better part of 2000.
The whole idea of quarterly performance reporting implies you
can predict the market or successfully shoot for profit targets.
Quarters as a measurement might not be real, but they provide a
comfortable structure for investors who mistakenly believe they
can demand nice, consistent profits. This demand for consistency
has led to a constant search for the Holy Grail or “hot hand” to the
detriment of ever winning consistently. It’s a catch-22.

emphasis on quarterly performance puts more importance on
scoring each quarter than it does on winning the game.
The alternative is to become a home run hitter and take what
the market gives no matter when it arrives. Absolute return traders,
trend followers, have no profit targets. They view their world as a
“rolling return.” I asked Bill Dunn how they address the quarterly
performance measures so popular on Wall Street. I wanted to know
how they educate clients to appreciate “big event hunting.” The
response was clear: “Clients must already have an appreciation for
the pitfalls of relying on short-term performance data before they
can appreciate us.”
Blunt talk for a serious game. On the other hand, after he
retired from trading, Julian Robertson publicly lamented his
constraints, comparing them to a necessary but incompetent
baseball umpire: “One of the great investors likened it to a batter
not having an umpire. If you don’t have an umpire, you can wait for
the fat pitch. The trouble with investing for other people,
particularly in a hedge fund, is that you do have an umpire—called
quarterly performance.”
If everyone knows the umpire of quarterly performance is
ridiculous, why do we stick with it? The behavioral and psycho-
logical biases to examine to answer such a simple question would
far exceed the few hundred pages of Trend Following!
The Always “New” Coming Storm
I added the following excerpt to mysecond edition of this book
in the fall of 2005. It was from commentary from a February 2004
edition of The Economist:
“The size of banks’ bets is rising rapidly the world over.

markets have risen, so banks have had to bet more in order
to continue generating huge profits. The present situation
“is not dissimilar” to the one that preceded the collapse of

Thompson once so sadly noted about the condition of human herds:
“In a nation ruled by swine, all pigs are upwardly mobile and the
rest of us are [screwed] until we can put our acts together: not
necessarily to win, but mainly to keep from losing completely. We
owe that to ourselves and our crippled self-image as something

away from the chart.”
• Trend followers are generally on the right side of big moves.
• The most interesting aspect of the Barings Bank blowout was
who won. Everyone knew the Queen’s bank lost, but the
winners were trend followers in the zero-sum game.

Henry to name a few trend followers swing for the fence. They hit
home runs in their trading performance. They are the Babe Ruths
of trend following. If any of them coached a baseball team, they
would approach it like the former manager of the Baltimore Orioles:
“EarlWeaver designed his offenses to maximize the chance
of a three-run homer. He didn’t bunt, and he had a special
taste for guys who got on base and guys who hit home
runs.”4
EdSeykota uses a clever baseball analogy to explain his view of
absolute returns (and home runs):
“When you’re up to bat, it doesn’t pay to hedge your

If you are going to play, you might as well play hard. Swing hard

Red Sox 2003–2007
Red Sox Nation still debates whether Pedro Martinez should
have been lifted in the eighth inning of Game 7 of the 2003
American League Championship Series against the Yankees. He was
left in, and the Yankees rallied from three runs down to win the
series. Grady Little, the Red Sox manager, was blamed for Boston’s
loss and fired soon thereafter. Many people wondered if he was
unfairly scapegoated for a decision others would have possibly
made too. After all, Martinez was his ace, and Little’s gut told him
to stay with his ace.
Perhaps in this situation, Martinez gets through the eighth 9
times out of 10. After all, the percentage of innings in which a
pitcher gives up three or more runs is small, and Martinez was an
exceptional pitcher. However, a look at the numbers says that
leaving him in was the wrong decision. After 105 pitches in a given
start, his batting average against rises to .370. He ended up
throwing 123 pitches in Game 7.

one way or another, as Carl Sagan reminds us:
“It is far better to grasp the universe as it really is than to

Prospect Theory
Investment bubbles have always been a part of market history.
For example, seventeenth century speculators in the Netherlands
drove up the prices of tulip bulbs to absurd levels. The inevitable
crash followed. Since then, from the Great Depression to the dot-
com implosion to October and November 2008, people can’t seem
to steer clear from manias. They repeatedly make the same
mistakes.
Daniel Kahneman, a Princeton professor who was the first
psychologist to win the Nobel Prize in Economics, attributed
market manias to investors’ “illusion of control,”calling the illusion
“prospect theory.” He studied the intellectual underpinnings of
investing—how traders estimate odds and calculate risks—to prove

Chapter 6 • Human Behavior 195
how often we act from the mistaken belief that we know more than
we do.
Kahneman found that a typical person acts on what they
christened the “law of small numbers”—basing broad predictions
on narrow samples of data. For instance, if we buy a fund that’s
beaten the market three years in a row, we are convinced it’s on a
hot streak. People are simply unable to stop themselves from over-
generalizing the importance of a just a few supporting facts. Limited

it later. The problem with accepting a loss is that it forces us to Lao Tsu6
admit we were wrong. Human beings don’t like to be wrong.
Not surprisingly, any discussion of why investors are their own
worst enemies must start with the concept of a sunk cost. A sunk
cost is simply a cost that has already been incurred that you can’t
recoup. Thinking in terms of sunk costs lets you see a loss for what
it actually is—a loss. Although sunk costs must not influence our
present decisions, we have a hard time forgetting the past. A person
might buy more of a stock even though it is tanking simply because
of the initial decision to buy it. The person can then say proudly, “I
bought on a discount!” Of course if the price of the stock never goes
up again, as is often the case, this theory implodes.
“Take your small loss and go home” is the trend following
mantra. However, most of us are ambivalent when we have to deal
with sunk costs. Although intellectually we know that there is
nothing we can do about money already spent and we should move
on, emotionally we dwell.
An experiment with a $10 theater ticket demonstrates the
irrationality of sunk costs. Kahneman told one group of students to

196 Trend Following (Updated Edition): Learn to Make Millions in Up or Down Markets
imagine they have arrived at the theater only to discover they have
lost their ticket. “Would you pay another $10 to buy another
ticket?” A second group was told to imagine that they are going to
the play but haven’t bought a ticket in advance. When they arrive
at the theater, they realize they have lost a $10 bill. Would they still
buy a ticket? In both cases, the students were presented with
essentially the same simple question: Would you want to spend $10
to see the play? Eighty-eight percent of the second group, which
had lost the $10 bill, opted to buy the ticket. However, the first
group, the ticket losers, focusing on sunk costs, tended to ask the
question in a different way: Am I willing to spend $20 to see a $10
play? Only 46 percent said yes.7

Emotional Intelligence: Daniel Goleman
Many tradersmindlessly repeat the same actions, day after day,
hoping for better results. They want to believe that if they are able
to discern patterns, they will win. As a result, they are continually
making connections and drawing parallels that are not valid. They
miss seeing the differences. Ironically, the real pattern they miss is
the pattern of acting with complete confidence to make decisions,
right or wrong, in the face of the unknown.
The less confident we are, the more frustrating and demoral-
izing the experiences will be. The more you learn about the markets
and yourself, the more confident you become. The more confident
you become, the more effective you become as a trader.
In 1995, psychologist Daniel Goleman published his best-seller
Emotional Intelligence, a powerful case for broadening the meaning
of intelligence to include our emotions. Drawing on brain and
behavioral research, Goleman demonstrated why people with high
IQs often flounder, while people with modest IQs often do
extremely well. The factors that influence how well we do in life
include self-awareness, self-discipline, intuition, empathy, and an
ability to enter the flow of life, character traits most traders would
not consider particularly useful for garnering profits from the
markets.16

Why have men like Richard Donchian and Ed Seykota (see

Chapter 2, “Great Trend Followers”) been able to teach trend
following? One answer is found in the field of Neuro-Linguistic
Programming (NLP). One of the top teachers of NLP is Charles
Faulkner who speaks with an authority and clarity gained from
having taught hundreds of traders how to gain the “mental edge”:
“NLP’s techniques involve moving out negative mental
beliefs and replacing them with positive ones. Think of an

Chapter 6 • Human Behavior 203
Seykota’s tribe works on the psychological and emotional issues
that he believes are crucial for successful trading (and life for that
matter). Faulkner tells a story about Seykota’s finely honed
intuition when it comes to trading:
“I am reminded of an experience that Seykota shared with
a group. He said that when he looks at a market, that
everyone else thinks has exhausted its up trend, that is
often when he likes to get in. When I asked him how he
made this determination, he said he just put the chart on
the other side of the room and if it looked like it was going
up, then he would buy it…Of course this trade was seen
through the eyes of someone with deep insight into the
market behavior.”31
Seykota doesn’t pretend to have all the answers, but he is
extremely good at turning the mirror back to students so they focus
on where issues really lie. His precision with language, like
Faulkner’s, makes one pay attention. One of Seykota’s students,
Chauncey DiLaura, broke down Seykota’s teachings:

Ignoring the opinions and contributions of others to be “right”
is not particularly “pleasing” behavior as Faulkner points out:
“One doesn’t have to be a student to want to please people
or want to be right. I would claim that serious students (and
professors) know there is much they don’t know, and are
less interested in what is right. On the other hand, those
that know little often feel the need to be in the right about
it. People pleasing is an entirely different dimension,
though people that need to be right are usually experienced
at ignoring others, and therefore, failing to please them.”

If I were to put their style into a baseball analogy I would ask:
Do you want to play ball or do you not want to play ball? The pitch
is coming across the plate. Decide whether to swing the bat. Know
how you will decide in advance. When the pitch comes—if it’s your
pitch, swing the bat. You want to wait for more information before
you swing? No time. Because in an uncertain world, if you wait until
the data is clear (or the ball has crossed the plate), you miss the
pitch.

Oxford Dictionary
GerdGigerenzer and Peter Todd’s Simple Heuristics That Make Us
Smart shows how we can cope with the complexities of our world
using the simplest of decision-making tools. Their premise is as
follows:
“Fast and frugal heuristics employ a minimum of time,
knowledge, and computation to make adaptive choices in
real environments.”8
For example, a component of fast and frugal heuristics is one-
reason decision making. This sounds remarkably like what trend
followers do when faced with a trading decision:
“One reason decision makers use only a single piece of
information for making a decision—this is their common
building block. Therefore, they can also stop their search as
soon as the first reason is found that allows a decision to be
made.”10

Gigerenzer and Todd elaborate: “[T]hat fast and frugal
heuristics can guide behavior in challenging domains when the
environment is changing rapidly (for example, in stock market
investment), when the environment requires many decisions to be
made in a successively dependent fashion. These particular features
of social environments can be exploited by heuristics that make
rapid decisions rather than gathering and processing information
over a long period during which a fleeter-minded competitor could

when the move is clear to everyone. Those people are the herders

Here is another decision-making story similar to the pitcher &
catcher relationship in Tim McCarver’s earlier story. Years ago in
baseball, the catcher and the pitcher called the pitches. Today you
still have a catcher and a pitcher, but the coaches in the dugout are
usually calling the pitches. Why? So the pitcher can execute exactly
what he’s told to do. When the typical Major League pitcher gets a
signal to throw a curveball, he doesn’t stand out there on the mound
debating it. He says to himself, “This is the system we’re using. I
have a coach on the sidelines with a computer. He’s charted
everything. He knows I should throw a curve ball. The only thing
I’m going to worry about right now is throwing a curveball to the
precise location that I’m supposed to throw it.” The pitcher than
can concentrate solely on execution—the best pitch possible he can
throw.
Likewise, as a trend follower, you wake up and see the market
move enough to cause you to take action (such as buy signal). For
example, the rule says buy at price level 20. You do it. You don’t
debate it or second guess it. Sure, that might feel boring and it
might feel like you’re not in control. It might feel like there should
be something more exciting, more glamorous, more fun to do in
which case you might consider a trip to Las Vegas. If you want to
win, you execute the signal as prescribed. That means you trade at Everything should be
price level 20, and you throw the curve ball when called for by the made as simple as

Smart advice.
Key Points
• Seykota: “Gigerenzer’s ‘fast and frugal heuristics’ is another
name for ‘rules of thumb.’ One pretty good one is: Trade with
the Trend.”
• Do not equate simplicity with unsophisticated thinking.
• As science looks closer, it is beginning to acknowledge that
intuition is not a gift, but a skill. Like any skill, it is something
you can learn.
• Occam’s razor: If you have two equal solutions to a problem,
pick the simplest.
• Fearless decision makers have a plan and execute it. They
don’t look back. Along the way if something changes, their plan
has flexibility built into it so they can adjust.
• Murray N. Rothbard, of Mises.org, states: “…if a formerly good
entrepreneur should suddenly make a bad mistake, he will
suffer losses proportionately; if a formerly poor entrepreneur
makes a good forecast, he will make proportionate gains. The
market is no respecter of past laurels, however large. Capital
does not ‘beget’ profit. Only wise entrepreneurial decisions do
that.”
• Mark Cuban: “With every effort, I learned a lot. With every
mistake and failure, not only mine, but of those around me, I
learned what not to do. I also got to study the success of those I
did business with as well. I had more than a healthy dose of
fear, and an unlimited amount of hope, and more importantly,
no limit on time and effort…The point of all this is that it
doesn’t matter how many times you fail. It doesn’t matter how
many times you almost get it right. No one is going to know or
care about your failures, and neither should you. All you have
to do is learn from them and those around you because…All
that matters in business is that you get it right once. Then
everyone can tell you how lucky you are.”

chaotic, nonlinear world:
“The world of mathematics has been confined to the linear
world for centuries. That is to say, mathematicians and
physicists have overlooked dynamical systems as random
and unpredictable. The only systems that could be
understood in the past were those that were believed to be
linear, that is to say, systems that follow predictable
patterns and arrangements. Linear equations, linear
functions, linear algebra, linear programming, and linear
accelerators are all areas that have been understood and
mastered by the human race. However, the problem arises
that we humans do not live in an even remotely linear
world; in fact, our world must indeed be categorized as
nonlinear; hence, proportion and linearity is scarce. How
may one go about pursuing and understanding a nonlinear
system in a world that is confined to the easy, logical
linearity of everything? This is the question that scientists
and mathematicians became burdened with in the
nineteenth century; hence, a new science and mathematics
was derived: chaos theory.”9
Although acceptance of a nonlinear world is a new concept for
many, it is not a new proposition for trend followers. The big events
described in Chapter 4, “Big Events, Crashes, and Panics,” such as
the 2008 market crash, are nonlinear events. Trend followers won
those events because they expected the unexpected. Lack of
linearity, or cause and effect, was not something unanticipated
because their trading models were built for the unexpected. How
did they do this? Trend followers are statistical thinkers. Gerd

proponent of the power of statistical thinking:

teach them three things: reading, writing, and statistical
thinking.’ At the beginning of the twenty-first century, how
far have we gotten with this program? In our society, we
teach most citizens reading and writing from the time they
are children, but not statistical thinking.”11
One of my favorite examples of statistical thinking is very
simple. It is a case study regarding the birth ratio of boys and girls.
Consider that there are two hospitals. In the first one, 120
babies are born every day; in the other, there are only 12. On
average, the ratio of boys to girls born every day in each hospital is
50/50. However, one day, in one of those hospitals twice as many
girls are born as boys. In which hospital was it more likely to
happen? The answer is obvious for a good trader, but as research
shows, not so obvious for a lay person: It is much more likely to
happen in the small hospital. The reason for this is that technically
speaking, the probability of a random deviation of a particular size
(from the population mean) decreases with the increase in the
sample size.12

The sample is too small.
The difference between these two views is why great trend
followers have grown from one-man shops to hugely successful
firms that routinely beat the so-called Wall Street powerhouses.
Why did Wall Street sit by and allow trend traders to enter and then
dominate arenas they could, and perhaps should, have controlled?
The answer lies in Wall Street’s fascination with benchmarks. Wall
Street is after index-like performance (“benchmarks”), whereas
trend followers are after absolute performance not hinged to
benchmarks.
Large, established Wall Street firms, many of which blew out in
2008 (unlike trend followers who made money in 2008), judge
success with measures of central tendency, not absolute return.

Trend followers never have and never will produce returns that
exhibit a normal distribution. They never produce consistent
average returns that hit benchmarks quarter after quarter. When
trend followers hit home runs in the zero-sum game and win huge
profits from the likes of Barings Bank, Long-Term Capital
Management, and the 2008 market crash, they are targeting the
edges or those fat tails of our non-normally distributed world. Jerry
Parker, the most successful of Richard Dennis’ trained turtle
traders, states this outright:
“The way I describe it is that overlaying trend following on
top of markets produce a non-normal distribution of trades.
And that’s sort of our edge—in these outlier trades. I don’t
know if we have an inherent rate of return, but when you
place this trend following on top of markets, it can produce
this distribution—the world is non-normal.”17

Another great compounding example? In October 1997, David
Harding launched the Winton Futures Fund, which has provided
investors with annualized returns of over 21 percent per year. To
put that in context, if you had been the buyer of Vincent van Gogh’s
“Irises” in 1947, you would have paid $80,000. The next time it
changed hands, in 1987, it was bought for $53.9 million. This seems
like a huge increase in value, but mathematically it shows a
compound average annual growth rate of 17.7 percent, which is less
than the annualized returns from Harding’s fund.
Compounding is not easy to do in a society forever focused on
instant gratification. However, if some trend following traders can
thrive and flourish in a compounded world, we all can.
Key Points
• Defining risk in terms of number is critical. If you can’t think
in terms of numbers, don’t play the game.
• To be successful as a trader and to be successful in life, you
need to develop the ability to ask the right questions.
• Trend following strategies make money on the edges of the bell
curve.
• Act as a devil’s advocate. Question assumptions. Check your
inferences. Consider the improbable or the unpopular.
• People mistakenly see a regular event and think it rare. They
think chance will correct a series of rare events. They see a
rare event and think it regular.
• People tend to regard extremely probable events as certain and
extremely improbable events as impossible.

After the stock market bubble burstin spring 2000 and after the
crash of October and November 2008, the concept of buy and hold
as a trading strategy should have been shown as the failure it is once
and for all. Yet, I doubt that has happened. Investors still obey
mantras such as, “Buy and hold for the long term.” “Stay the
course.” “Buy the dips.” “Never surrender.” Buy-and-hold mantras
are junk because they never answer the basic questions: Buy how
much of what? Buy at what price? Hold for how long? JerryParker
gives a strong rationale for choosing trend following over buy and
hold:
“Trend following is [similar] to a democracy. Sometimes it
doesn’t look so good, but it’s better than anything else out
there. It’s a worse investment now, let’s say, than it was in
the ‘70s or ‘80s. But so what? What other choice do we

Consider the NASDAQ market crash of 1973–1974. The
NASDAQ reached its high peak in December 1972. It then dropped
by nearly 60 percent, hitting rock bottom in September 1974. We
did not see the NASDAQ break permanently free of the 1973–1974
bear market until April 1980. Buy and hold did nothing for
investors from December 1972 through March 1980. Investors
would have made more money during this period in a 3 percent
savings account. History repeated itself with the more recent 77
percent drop in the NASDAQ from 2000–2002. Now we have
October and November 2008, which makes the dot-com bubble
look like a picnic with Grandma.
Making matters worse is that a pure buy-and-hold strategy
during an extended drop in the market makes the recovery back to
breakeven difficult (if not impossible).
The “buy-and-hold” investor has been led to believe (perhaps
by an industry with a powerful conflict of interest) that if he has
tremendous patience and discipline and “stays with it,” he will
make a good long-term return. These investors fully expect that
they will make back most, if not all, of recent losses soon enough.
They believe that the best place for long-term capital is the stock
market and that if they give it 5 or 10 or 20 years they will surely
do very well. Such investors need to understand that they can go 5,
10, and 20 years and make no return at all and even lose money.6
To compound problems even more, buy-and-hold panders to a You will run out of money

costs nor admit that buy-and-hold might not work. So they buy and
hold no matter what happens in the mean time.

a money manager at Alliance Capital Management Holding
LP, which owned a ton of Enron, put it, ‘On the surface it
had always seemed to be a fairly good growth stock. We
bought it all the way down.’”12
Glassman and Harrison are both dead wrong. What they call
dollar-cost averaging is really averaging a loser (Enron in this
example) all the way down. Traders should feel sick if they average
losers, not just embarrassed. When you have a losing position, it
must tell you something is wrong. As unbelievable as it seems to the
novice investor, the longer a market declines, the more likely it is
to continue declining. Falling markets must never be viewed as
places to buy cheap.
Harrison violated a cardinal rule of trading. In the zero-sum
world of trading, if the trend is down, it is not a buying opportunity;
it is a selling opportunity—a “time to go short” opportunity. Even
worse, as an active money manager for clients, he admitted to
averaging losers as a strategy. To top it off, Glassman later adds:
“Could the typical small investor have discovered a year
ago that Enron was on the brink of disaster? It’s highly
unlikely. Still, if you looked for the right thing, you would
have never bought Enron in the first place.”14
Actually, there was a way to spot Enron’s problems. The price
going from $90 to 50 cents was a pretty clear clue that the brink of
disaster was just around the corner. Jesse Livermore knew nearly
80 years earlier how to spot losers:
“I have warned against averaging losses. That is a most
common practice. Great numbers of people buy a stock, let

averaging losers as well. JulianRobertson ran one of the biggest and ClintEastwood
profitable hedge funds ever. However, things ended badly. On March
30, 2000, CNN excerpted a letter Julian Robertson wrote to Tiger’s
investors blaming the fund’s problems on the rush to cash in on the
Internet craze:
“As you have heard me say on a number of occasions, the
key to Tiger’s success over the years has been a steady
commitment to buying the best stocks and shorting the
worst. In a rational environment, this strategy functions
well. But in an irrational market, where earnings and price
considerations take a back seat to mouse clicks and
momentum, such logic, as we have learned, does not count
for much. The result of the demise of value investing and
investor withdrawals has been financial erosion, stressful to
us all. And there is no real indication that a quick end is in
sight.”16
The story of Tiger resembles a Greek tragedy, where the
protagonist is the victim of his own self-pride. Tiger’s spiral
downward started in the fall of 1998 when a catastrophic trade on
dollar-yen cost the fund billions. An ex-Tiger employee was quoted I am of the belief that the

Assimilating and sifting through vast quantities of information
was Robertson’s forte. According to one associate, “He can look at
a long list of numbers in a financial statement he’d never seen
before and say, ‘that one is wrong,’ and he’s right.” Although that
talent is impressive, being able to read and critique a balance sheet
doesn’t necessarily translate into knowing when and how much to
buy or sell as trend following trader Richard Donchian pointed out
(see Chapter 2, “Great Trend Followers”).
Crash and Panic
What do Julian Robertson, the concept of losers average losers,
the dot-com stock crash, and October 2008 have in common?
Bubbles. The 2008 crash is no different from the tulip bubble made
famous in Holland. In 1720, when the south sea bubble was at its
height, even the greatest genius of his time, Sir Isaac Newton, got
sucked into the hysteria. Investing as if his brilliance in science
carried over to his finances, Newton eventually lost £20,000.
Although bubbles might appear as short-term blips in economic
history, more often the aftermath is long term, resulting in severe
recessions and government intervention that usually makes the
situation worse. The collapse of bubbles of the past 400 years threw
each nation into a recession lasting a decade or longer. What lesson
can we learn from bubbles? Human nature continues to be the way
it has always been and probably always will be.19

only strategy:
• “What do you do if you find yourself at retirement age without

Analysis Paralysis
In 2000, there were 28,000 recommendations by brokerage-
house analysts. At the start of October 2000, 99.1 percent of those
recommendations on U.S. companies were either strong buy, buy,
or hold. Just 0.9 percent of the time, analysts said sell. Listening to
these analysts for guidance was the public’s conscious decision not
to think for themselves.
A study at Dartmouth College by Kent Womack observed that
analysts often comment on and recommend companies that their
firms have recently taken public. The research shows that stocks
recommended by analysts perform more poorly than “buy”
recommendations by unaffiliated brokers prior to, at the time of,
and subsequent to the recommendation date.

experience—and all I presume to offer you today is
observations drawn on my own experience, which is hardly
the wisdom of the ages—in my experience, this
conventional view of risk is shortsighted and often simply
mistaken. My first observation is that successful people
understand that risk, properly conceived, is often highly
productive rather than something to avoid. They appreciate
that risk is an advantage to be used rather than a pitfall to
be skirted. Such people understand that taking calculated
risks is quite different from being rash. This view of risk is
not only unorthodox, it is paradoxical—the first of several
paradoxes which I’m going to present to you today. This
one might be encapsulated as follows: Playing it safe is
dangerous. Far more often than you would realize, the real
risk in life turns out to be the refusal to take a risk.”4
Life is fraught with risk. There is no getting away from it.
However we try to control the direction of our lives, there are times
when we fail. Therefore, we might as well accept that life is a game
of chance. If life is a game of chance, to one degree or another, we
must be comfortable with assessing odds in the face of risk.
Bottom line, there is no way to avoid making choices, and those
choices create risk. Money under a mattress is no good. Buy a

the age of 65? 2008 burned down that idea!
How should we proceed in the face of risk? We should begin by
accepting the fact that markets do not reward stupidity in the long
run. They reward those with the brains, guts, and determination to
find opportunity where others have overlooked it and to press on
and succeed where others have fallen short and failed.
Think about your money from a business perspective. Every
business is ultimately involved in assessing risk. Putting capital to
work in the hopes of making it grow is the goal. In that sense, all
businesses are the same. The right decisions lead to success and the
wrong ones lead to bankruptcy (Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers,
AIG, IndyMac, and so on). Here are key issues that are addressed in

had any desire in the first place.
But there is hope. If you study risk, you will find there are two
kinds: blind risk and calculated risk. The first one, blind risk, is
suspect. Blind risk is the calling card of laziness, the irrational hope,
something for nothing, the cold twist of fate. Blind risk is the
pointless gamble, the emotional decision, and the sucker play. The
man who embraces blind risk demonstrates all the wisdom and
intelligence of a drunk stepping into traffic.
However, calculated risk builds fortunes, nations, and empires.
Calculated risk and bold vision go hand in hand. To use your mind,
to see the possibilities, to work things out logically, and then to
move forward in strength and confidence is what places man above
the animals. Calculated risk lies at the heart of every great
achievement and achiever since the dawn of time. Trend followers
thrive on calculated risk.

Think about it this way. Most traders focus only on how to enter
a market. Many will say, “Hey, I’ve got a way to beat the markets
because this trading system I have, it’s right 80 percent of the time.
It’s only wrong 20 percent of the time.” They need to take a step
back for a second and say, “Okay. What does 80 percent right
mean?” If 80 percent of the time you don’t win much, but 20
percent of the time you lose a lot, your losses can far outweigh your
gains even though you’re right 80 percent of the time. You must
take the magnitude of wins and losses into account.
Lotteries, for example, can reach jackpots of hundreds of
millions of dollars or more. And as the jackpot gets bigger, more
people buy tickets in the buying feeding frenzy. But as they buy
more tickets, the odds of winning do not increase in any
appreciable fashion. The ticket buyers still have a better chance of
being struck by lightning as they leave the convenience store.
For example, the odds of winning the California Super Lotto
Jackpot are 1 in 18 million. If one person purchases 50 Lotto tickets
each week, he will win the jackpot about once every 5,000 years. If

a car gets 25 miles per gallon, and a gallon of gas is bought for every
Lotto ticket bought, there will be enough gas for about 750 round
trips to the moon before the jackpot is won. If you know the odds
are against you why would you even play?
Likewise, if your trading system says that you have a 1 in
30,000 chance of winning, or roughly the same chance as being
struck by lightning, you might not want to bet everything on that
trade. When you trade, you must have a mathematical expectation,
or “edge,” or you can’t win. For example, consider a coin-flipping
game.
Imagine for a moment a coin toss game with an unbiased coin.
Suppose also that we are offered the opportunity to bet that the
next flip will be heads and the payoff will be even money when we

3/2, a gain of $1.50 in addition to a $1 bet—the expectation would
change to:
(.5) (1.5) + (.5) (–1) = +.25
Playing this game 100 times would give us a positive
expectation of .25.8
This is the kind of edge cultivated and honed daily by trend
followers. You might ask, “If everyone knows about expectation,
how can I ever find my edge?”
Think about it this way. Consider a scene from the movie A
Beautiful Mind, the biography of mathematician John Nash. Nash
and some of his mathematician buddies are in a bar when a sexy
blonde and four brunettes walk in. After they admire the new
arrivals, Nash and his friends decide to compete for the blonde.
However, Nash has reservations, correctly observing that, if
everyone goes for the same woman, they will just end up blocking
each other out. Worse, they will offend the rest of the women. The

only way for everyone to succeed is to ignore the blonde and hit on
the brunettes. The scene dramatizes the Nash Equilibrium, his
most important contribution to game theory. Nash proved that in
any competitive situation—war, chess, even picking up a date at a
bar—if the participants are rational and they know that their
opponents are rational, there is only one optimal strategy. That
theory won Nash a Nobel Prize in economics and transformed the
way we think about competition in both games and the real world.10
Building off Nash’s general thoughts, EdSeykota lays out a basic
risk definition from a trading perspective: “Risk is the possibility of
loss.” That is, if we own some stock, and there is a possibility of a
price decline, we are at risk. The stock is not the risk, nor is the loss
the risk. The possibility of loss is the risk. As long as we own the
stock, we are at risk. The only way to control the risk is to buy or
sell stock. In the matter of owning stocks, and aiming for profit, risk
is fundamentally unavoidable and the best we can do is to manage
the risk. To manage is to direct and control. Risk management is to
direct and control the possibility of loss. The activities of a risk
manager are to measure risk and to increase and decrease risk by
buying and selling stock. In general, good risk management
combines several elements:
1. Clarifying trading and risk management systems until they can
translate to computer code.
2. Inclusion of diversification and instrument selection into the
back-testing process.
3. Back-testing and stress-testing to determine trading parameter
sensitivity and optimal values.
4. Clear agreement of all parties on expectation of volatility and
return.
5. Maintenance of supportive relationships between investors and
managers.
6. Above all, stick to the system.
7. See #6, above.
As you navigate this chapter, keep in mind Seykota’s wisdom.

“What do you really want? Why are you trading? What are your
strengths and weaknesses? Do you have any emotional issues? How
disciplined are you? Are you easily convinced? How confident are
you in yourself? How confident are you in your system? How much
risk can you handle?”

Answering these questions in advance helps when you are in
the middle of the zero-sum game and the adrenaline and sweat are
flowing.
What Market Do You Buy or Sell at Any Time?
One of the first decisions any trader makes is what to trade.
Will you trade stocks? Currencies? Futures? Commodities? What
markets will you choose? While some people might focus on
limited, market-specific portfolios, such as currencies or bonds,
others pursue a more widely diversified portfolio of markets. For
example, The Adam, Harding, & Lueck (AHL) Diversified Program
(the largest trend following fund in the world now run by Man
Financial) trades a diversified portfolio of over 100 core markets on
36 exchanges. They trade stock indices, bonds, currencies, short-
term interest rates, and commodities (energy, metal, and
agricultural contracts):
CHART 10.1: AHL Portfolio
Currencies: 24.3%
Bonds: 19.8%
Energies: 19.2%
Stocks: 15.1%
Interest rates: 8.5%
Metals: 8.2%
Agriculturals: 4.9%
AHL does not have fundamental expertise in all of these
markets. I know of no trend follower who keeps fundamental
experts on staff. They do not have in-depth understanding of each
of the companies that comprise whatever stock index. Their
expertise is to take these different markets and “make them the
same” through price analysis.
When you look at a breakdown of performance at any given
time, losses are typically negated by winners. This is by design
because no one ever knows which market will be the one to take off
with a big trend that pays for all of the losses—hence the need for
diversification. AHL is even more precise about its need for

diversification in an uncertain world: “The cornerstone of the AHL
investment philosophy is that financial markets experience
persistent anomalies or inefficiencies in the form of price trends.
Trends are a manifestation of serial correlation in financial
markets—the phenomenon whereby past price movements inform
about future price behavior. Serial correlation can be explained by
factors as obvious as crowd behavior, as well as more subtle factors,
such as varying levels of information among different market
participants. Although they vary in their intensity, duration, and
frequency, price trends are universally recurrent across all sectors
and markets. Trends are an attractive focus for active trading styles
applied across a diverse range of global markets.”

“Money management is like sex: Everyone does it, one way
or another, but not many like to talk about it and some do
it better than others. When any trader makes a decision to
buy or sell (short), they must also decide at that time how
many shares or contracts to buy or sell—the order form on
every brokerage page has a blank spot where the size of the
order is specified. The essence of risk management is
making a logical decision about how much to buy or sell
when you fill in this blank. This decision determines the
risk of the trade. Accept too much risk and you increase the
odds that you will go bust; take too little risk and you will
not be rewarded in sufficient quantity to beat the
transaction costs and the overhead of your efforts. Good
money management practice is about finding the sweet
spot between these undesirable extremes.”14

those 30 days. There’s an optimum amount of lifting that you can
do in a day that gets you ahead without setting you back. You want
to be at that optimal point just as you want to get to an optimal
point with money management. There indeed is just such a
number. Ed Seykota describes that optimal point with the concept
of “heat”:
“Placing a trade with a predetermined stop-loss point can
be compared to placing a bet: The more money risked, the
larger the bet. Conservative betting produces conservative
performance, while bold betting leads to spectacular ruin. A
bold trader placing large bets feels pressure—or heat—from
the volatility of the portfolio. A hot portfolio keeps more at
risk than does a cold one. Portfolio heat seems to be
associated with personality preference; bold traders prefer
and are able to take more heat, while more conservative
traders generally avoid the circumstances that give rise to
heat. In portfolio management, we call the distributed bet
size the heat of the portfolio. A diversified portfolio risking
2 percent on each of five instruments has a total heat of 10
percent, as does a portfolio risking 5 percent on each of two
instruments.”16
Chauncy DiLaura, a student of Seykota’s, adds to the
explanation, “There has to be some governor so I don’t end up with
a whole lot of risk. The size of the bet is small around 2 percent.”
Seykota calls his risk-adjusted equity “core equity” and the risk
tolerance percentage “heat.” Hcan be turned up or down to suit the
trader’s pain tolerance—as the heat gets higher, so do the gains, but
only up to a point. Past that point, more heat starts to reduce the
gain. The trader must be able to select a heat level where he is
comfortable.17
Also critical is how you handle your capital as it grows or
shrinks. Do you trade the same with $100,000 as you would
$200,000? What if your $100,000 goes to $75,000?
Trend follower Tom Basso knows traders usually begin trading
small, say with one contract and as they get more confident they
might increase to 10 contracts. Eventually they attain a comfort
level of 100 or 1,000 contracts, where they may stay. Basso
counsels against this. He stresses that the goal is to keep things on
constant leverage. His method of calculating the number of

260 Trend Following (Updated Edition): Learn to Make Millions in Up or Down Markets
When do trend followers enter? After a trend has begun. As I
mention in Chapter 1, trend followers have no ability to predict
when a trend will start. The only way to know that a trend has
started is when it starts to move either up or down. For example,
let’s say Apple is trading between 100 and 120 for six months. All of
a sudden Apple jumps, or breaks out, to a price level of 130. That
type of upward movement from a range is a trigger for trend
followers. They say, “I might not know that Apple is going to
continue upward, but it’s been going sideways for a while, and all of
a sudden, the price has jumped to 130. I’m not in this game to try
and find bargains or cheap places to buy. I’m in this game to follow
trends, and the trend is up.” This approach is counterintuitive for
many. One trend trader outlined the simplicity:
“As our systems are designed to send a buy or sell signal
only when a clear trend develops. By definition, we never
get in at the beginning of a trend or get out at the top.”20
If your goal is to ride a trend that starts at 50 and perhaps goes
to 100, does it really make a difference whether you got in at 52 or
60 or 70? Even if you got in at 70 and the trend went to 100, you
still made a lot, right? Of course if you got in at 52 (and how you
think you might predict the bottom, I will never know), you made
more money than if you got in at 70. There are plenty of traders out
there who think, “Oh, I couldn’t get in at 52, so I don’t get in at all,
even if I have the chance to get in at 70.” Richard Dennis
elaborates:
You’ve got to think about “Anytime the market goes up a reasonable amount—say a

are at $8.00 and go to $9.00, if the choice is to buy them at

them at $9.00. They may never retrace to $8.80. Statistics
would show that you make more money buying them and
not waiting for a retracement.”21
Even if people are familiar with Dennis’ approach to trading,
they still focus on entry—a misdirection of energy and focus.

Chapter 10 • Trading Systems 261
Seykota dead-panned: “The entry is a big concern before it
happens, a small concern thereafter.”22
He is saying that after you are in a trade, the entry price isn’t
important. You have no idea how high the market is going to go,
right? You should be concerned about protecting your downside in
case the market goes against you as opposed to creating dramas
associated with entry. How long can trend following trades last?
Another trend trader opined:
“Positions held for two to four months are not unusual, and
some have been held for more than one year, says a
spokesman. Historically, only 30–40 percent of trades have
been profitable.”23
The words of great baseball player Ted Williams immediately
come to mind: “Hitting a baseball, I’ve said it a thousand times, is
the single most difficult thing to do in sport. If Joe Montana or Dan
Marino completed 3 of every 10 passes they attempted, they would
be ex-professional quarterbacks. If Larry Bird or Magic Johnson
made 3 of every 10 shots they took, their coaches would take the
basketball away from them.”24
However analogous it is to baseball, only 40 percent winners is
hardly a percentage worth most people would think wise to
emulate. So how is it possible to make money with 40 percent of
your trades winners? Jim Little of trend follower Campbell and
Company was clear:
“Say, for example, on the 60 percent, you lose 1 percent of
your capital, but on the 40 percent winning trades you
make 2 percent. Over longer periods of time, say a year or
more, this would net 20 percent on a broadly diversified
program.”25
In other words, winning and losing trades over time are blended
together. Winners make up for small losers. Trend followers’ rules to
enter and exit are driven by what many call technical indicators.
The technical indicator for trend followers is price action. However,
most traders remain preoccupied with the hundreds upon hundreds
of other indicators that promise “prediction.” They discuss and
debate which is better—MACD or Bollinger Bands? Which is more
profitable—ADX or Williams %R?

When Do You Get Out of a Losing Position?
The time to think most clearly about why and when to exit is
before getting in. In any trading system, the most important thing
is to preserve your capital. A sell strategy gives the opportunity to
not only preserve capital, but to also redeploy into more opportune
markets. When do trend traders actually get out of a losing
position? Fast! This is a fundamental element of trend following.
The logic of cutting your losses and then cutting them even more
has been around far longer than trend following as Bernard Baruch

“Back in the early ‘90s, Commodities Corporation (CC)

hoped to give them some insight into how I handled the

them I thought it was great to find a mentor and I was
available anytime they had questions or issues and that is

only 1 percent per bet in dealing with public money. I am

CHART 10.2: Trend Following Entry/Exit Example: The Middle
Your Trading System
When you mechanize a trend following trading system, you
take all your discretionary judgments and build them into the rules.
For example, if you know you are uncomfortable with a high level
of risk, you make a rule that sets a tolerable level of risk. If you want
to trade a currency-only portfolio, you make that a part of the rules
from the beginning. The idea is to “hardwire” all scenarios that you
could see in daily trading in advance across a portfolio. If a market
rises 100 percent in a day, you have rules that tell you what to do.
If a market loses 10 percent, follow your rules.
When you are in the heat of the trading battle, your rules for
entry or exit or how much you should buy must be precise. You
cannot afford to think about the rules as the situation unfolds. You
must have an unambiguous plan established in advance. It also
helps to be on the defensive as Larry Hite reminds:
“We approach markets backwards. The first thing we ask is
not what can we make, but how much can we lose. We play
a defensive game.”28

FAQ #2: Trend Following for Stocks
One of thegreat myths regarding trend following is that it does
not work with stocks. That is wrong thinking. Trends in stocks are
no different than trends in currencies, commodities, or futures.
Chesapeake Capital, Jerry Parker’s trend following firm, for
example, has adapted its system to stock trading. Parker says his
system works well with stocks, particularly stocks in outlier moves
that are in single industries. He adds:
“Our expertise [is] in systematic trend following or model
development. So maybe we trend follow with Chinese
porcelain. Maybe we trend follow with gold and silver, or
stock futures, or whatever the client needs. We’re trading
these great systems, and testing, and making sure what we
do has worked in the past. And being disciplined, and
unemotional, and applying our methods to the futures
markets, but limiting our trading to this one group of
markets. We need to look at the investment world globally
and communicate our expertise of systematic trading.”31

I am reminded of the opening line from a 1979 article from
“Managed Account Reports” that I found in research: “Trading
stocks and commodity futures by means of trend following
techniques is an art with a long history.”33

extensive research materials that justify the use of trend following

FAQ #3: Insight on Computers and Curve Fitting
Larry Hite has said that a computer can’t get up on the wrong
side of the bed in the morning, which is why he relies on computers
for his decision making and for his implementation of his trading
rules:
“If your boyfriend or girlfriend breaks up with you, you’ll
feel one way; if you get engaged, you’ll feel another way.”34
Hite said he would much rather have one smart guy working on
a lone Macintosh than a team of well-paid timekeepers with an
army of supercomputers. At the same time, however, Hite was
adamant that the real key to using computers successfully was the
thinking that went into the computer code. When someone asked
why even go the computer route if people power is so important.
Hite responded:
“[B]ecause it works—it’s countable and replicable. I’m a
great fan of the scientific method. And the other things are
not scientific. If I give you the algorithms, you should be
able to get the same results I did. That to me means a great
deal.”35

modeling systems like system writer, day trader and some of the
other things, we’ve been able to model some of our systems on these
products. Mostlyjust to back test what we already knew, that trend
following works.”40
Tom Basso sees the benefit: “You’ll find that the more you’re
computerized, the more markets you’ll be able to handle.
Computers leverage your time if you know how to use them.”41
Further, RichardDonchian’s timeless wisdom should give many
pause:
“If you trade on a definite trend following, loss-limiting
method, you can [trade] without taking a great deal of time
from your regular business day. Because action is taken
only when certain evidence is registered, you can spend a
minute or two per [market] in the evening checking up on
whether action-taking evidence is apparent, and then in

orders in accord with what is indicated. [Furthermore] a
definite method, which at all times includes precise criteria
for closing out one’s losing trades promptly, avoids…
emotionally unnerving indecision.”

System results must be periodically compared to actual results to
ensure that your testing closely reflects what is happening in real
time. It is also helpful to keep a journal to record how well you stick
to the processes of executing your system.

Chapter 10 • Trading Systems 271
hung up on the ‘need’ to be right rather than the ‘desire’ to make
money. I learned early that being ‘right,’ of having a high percentage
of winners, had very little to do with my overall trading success.
Those who have a need to be right with a high percentage of
winners will find themselves passing on their best trading
opportunities, assuming they use some degree of discretion in their
trade selections. One of my trading buddies enjoys a trading
success rate annually of around 15 percent winners with 50 percent
losers and 35 percent breakeven trades. In 2005, he made over 300
percent on his initial beginning of year trading capital [of] a seven-
figure account. This is a risk-reward numbers game and most who
think it is something else usually face a ‘forced awareness’ at some
point in their trading careers. To further emphasize my point,
everyone has seen ads on the Internet for systems being promoted
for say a 90 percent accuracy. I bet 3/4 of these systems are based
on a set of past criteria that have very little to do with their future
performance. Let’s say we do 100 trades in a calendar year. The
average winning trade makes a net $100 so we make a net $9,000
in the ‘winners.’ Now the bad news is the 10 losing trades are for
$1,000 so we lose a total of $1,000 for the year in a system that had
90 percent winners. Now, I realize this is a stretch from reality, but
mathematically this is what happens once a trader commits capital
to the so-called ‘sure thing’ trading systems!”
Trend follower KenTropin was even more specific: “In order for
a system to be successful, it has to be what I call robust. Robust
means that I can test that system in a market I designed it around.
Say I’m using it in the treasury bonds, and then if I switch that
market and I try that system in the Euro, it still works. And if I
change its parameters, it still works. And if I switch it over to corn—
something totally different than treasury bonds—it still works. And
if I look at some data that was out of sample from what I designed
it around, it still works. Then I have something that might be
interesting and have a chance of living in the future. Because the
nature of data is it changes a little all the time. And so the key to
success in systems trading is to have what I call a loose fitting suit.
I can’t have a suit that’s so tight and perfectly proportioned to me
that if I gain two pounds, it won’t fit the data anymore.”
Andrew Lo brings it back to simplicity: “The first [rule of
thumb] being that no matter how complex and subtle a strategy is
and no matter how sophisticated it might be, it has to be possible to



==================================================
                     PAGE 299

describe that strategy in relatively simple and intuitive terms to a
sophisticated investor. In other words, regardless of how subtle and
impressive and sophisticated the strategy is, I’ve never come across
anything that couldn’t be described in relatively straightforward
terms as to what the value added of that strategy was, whether it
was risk transfer, superior information, better executions, mean
reversion, and so on. So, I think that’s the first principle that I think
is obvious to many investors; but to some who are not as familiar
with quantitative methods, they may feel that they’re just not really
smart enough to understand. But, I think that’s just not the case.
The second rule of thumb is that you’ll never see a bad back test.
Now, again, this may be obvious to the experienced investor, but
there’s a very specific set of quantitative models that you can use to
be able to gauge the bias that comes about from selection. The fact
is that when I’ve talked with investors about doing due diligence,
I’ve often said that, you know, whatever back test you’d like to see,
I can certainly produce it for you. If you torture the data long

Blame Game
Not surprisingly, trend followers are sometimes accused of
throwing the markets into disarray. Whenever a stock tanks, a
bubble bursts, or a scandal hits, winning traders catch blame. The
blame is never affixed to the little old lady in Omaha, who thought
that some dotcom-invented web site would replace Walmart, and
consequently lost her life savings gambling on dotcom stocks. The

• They don’t invest, they just trade: Reality? The markets are for
trading, not for investing. The markets reward winners, not
losers. We can all choose, so if we choose wrong, it’s time to
look in the mirror.
• Long Term Capital Management (LTCM): The LTCM hedge
fund (like the many more that failed in the 10 years after its
death) proved that bad traders with bad strategy fail. Trend

Trend followers have also been condemned for making money
on the downside:
“[Traders] have always been an easy target for the press
whenever the public is looking for someone to blame for
volatile markets, [and] … the press have singled out ‘the
short sellers’… Perception or reality, many will now picture
[traders] as bad boys, or ‘boys having a bit of fun’… Making
money in downside markets is portrayed as obscene and to

about specific trading skills practiced by highly

Decrease Leverage; Decrease Return
Richard Dennis’ Turtle students (see my second book, The
Complete TurtleTrader) were originally instructed to make as much
money as possible. They had no restrictions except to shoot for
home runs. They were absolute return traders while under Dennis’
guidance. However, later on, when they went out on their own to
manage money for clients, some changed how they traded. Many of
them accepted clients who demanded less leverage and ultimately
less return. As a result, their performance records have sometimes
been far less impressive than the old pro trend followers.

2004. Almost immediately, the book made a splash landing in the
top 100 of all books available at Amazon.com. One hedge fund that
I had never heard of bought 1,000 copies because they liked the
message and wanted to use it as an educational tool. Another fund
bought 3,000 copies. Quickly, the success of the book brought me
in contact with an assortment of Wall Street professionals.
Much of that recognition started in Baltimore at Legg Mason’s
headquarters. Richard Cripps, the Chief Market Strategist at Legg
Mason, wrote a review of Trend Following. Following his review, he
invited me to Legg Mason’s headquarters for lunch with his
colleague TimothyMcCann. We talked about my book and the Legg
Mason Equity Compass, a systematic trading model for stocks. After
our conversation, Cripps escorted me up a flight of stairs to a

Not long after those initial meetings, I had the opportunity to sit
down with LarryHite at his home in Manhattan and at his office on

What accounts for the patience, discipline, and commitment to
long-term success as a trend follower? It might ultimately be about
making a profit, but it is also an understanding and keen

trend following. Yet, if the approach is that simple (and profitable),
then why does trend following continue to be ignored or confused

predicted October 2008? No, they did not, but they sure made

Another common source of confusion stems from not
understanding trend following’s reliance on reactive technical
analysis. For example, one form of technical analysis attempts to
“read” charts to divine the market direction. The second form of
technical analysis, practiced by trend followers, is based on reacting
to market movements whenever they occur. Although I make this
distinction clear in Chapter 1 of Trend Following, I still find myself

What about supposed “lower-risk” strategies such as PIPEs or
other arcane forms of arbitrage trading? One trend follower emailed
me an observation:
“What a novel way to avoid being in a drawdown: Trade an
instrument that is so illiquid that there is no market for it

risks I really take is if the asset goes to a level that forces
me to liquidate at a big loss. In that case, my strategy does
not appear quite so risk free.”

people thought that I had not accentuated the drawdowns of trend

Further, Bhardwaj thinks the Sharpe ratio is an appropriate
measure of trend following traders. It is not (see Chapter 3,
“Performance Data”). Trend following trader David Harding has
written on the Sharpe ratio: “The Sharpe ratio appears at first blush
to reward returns (good) and penalize risks (bad). Upon closer
inspection, things are not so simple. The standard deviation takes
into account the distance of each return from the mean, positive or
negative. By this token, large positive returns increase the
perception of risk as though they could as easily be negative, which
for a dynamic investment strategy [like trend following] may not be

Foreword to the
First Edition by
Charles Faulkner
If you are browsing through this in a bookstore, you are most
likely in the investments section. Look around. All of the people
near you are also looking for an investing edge. If you are online,
you can see by the ratings and recommendations that many other
people have been here before you. The other titles in front of you,
whether they are actual or virtual, all claim to represent an
opportunity to enrich you. Whether you know it or not, you are in
a market. You are looking for a winning trade—the information, the
edge—that will put you ahead in the markets of stocks, bonds, real
estate, or commodities.
When I first modeled the trading strategies of J. Peter
Steidlmayer, CBOT trader and the originator of the Market Profile,
I had a narrow notion of what makes a market, or how to make
money in one. I had heard of George Soros, Jim Rogers, Peter
Lynch, and a few others. When I heard the phrase, “buy low and sell
high,” it made sense to me. It also happened to appeal to me as a
former antiques dealer and all-round bargain hunter.
I didn’t know how little I knew. Somehow I traded my model of
the Market Profile—despite my utter ignorance of risk and money
management—into a tidy profit. A colleague pointed out to me, “So
you’re betting on your opinion of other people’s opinions.” The
reality of W.C. Fields’ famous retort to Mae West’s question (in My
Little Chickade) sunk in. “Is poker a game of chance?” “Not the
way I play it.” I was concerned only with market signals—I had a
stretch of what you’ll learn was “Dumb Luck,” instead of the “Poetic
Justice” usually dealt to traders with such a lack of preparation. I
got out to trade another day.

300 Trend Following (Updated Edition): Learn to Make Millions in Up or Down Markets
My chapter in Jack Schwager’s The New Market Wizards made
it possible for me to meet top traders across the industry.
Sometimes we appeared on professional panels together. Other
times, it was a private conversation. I want to share some of what I
learned with you. Before I do, though, I want you to take out a dollar
bill. Turn it over. You will see two seals. Look at the one on the left.
The one with the words “THE GREAT SEAL” inscribed underneath
it, the one with an unfinished pyramid of 13 steps with an eye in a
glowing triangle floating above it. It is a wonderful symbol for a
successful trader and represents a trading tool as well.
The stones of the pyramid represent the ways a trader can
make money. There’s intermediation (brokerage charges),
aggregating clients (reducing costs), carry trades, privileged
information (insider trading), assessing asset flows (an institutional
advantage), advanced technology (particularly for option pricing),
models of economic actors and data (fundamentals), models of
historical price data (technicals), and others. Some of these are
basic—those near the base of the pyramid—and so they offer low
returns. Other methods offer high returns. Naturally, as you make
your way up on the pyramid, there are fewer stones. No one should
be surprised by this. Neither was I.
What did surprise me when meeting and modeling these market
wizards was that despite their outward, often dramatic, differences
in trading and life style, their thinking about their trading principles
was extremely similar. It was like they were floating above the
world, seeing it from a different perspective than the rest of the
market participants. What are these differences? Here are a few
from the eye of the pyramid:
• It doesn’t matter what you think, it’s what the market does that
matters.
• What matters can be measured, so keep refining your
measurements.
• You don’t need to know when something will happen to know
that it will.
• Successful trading is a probabilistic business, so plan
accordingly.
• There is an edge to be gained in every aspect of your trading
system.

Foreword to the First Edition by Charles Faulkner 301
• Everyone is fallible, even you, so your system must take this
into account.
• Trading means losing as well as winning, something you must
learn to live with.
Now, you might say to yourself, “Where’s the secret sauce in
that?” In one sense, you’re right. These are extremely simple
principles. At the same time they are counterintuitive and take a
focused effort to apply. Let megive you an example: I was attending
the trading system conference where I first met market wizard Ed
Seykota. His table was talking about how successful trading systems
could, and should, be simple enough that they could fit on a bumper
sticker. Of course, skepticism emanated from other tables. “What
about the complexities of the markets?” Their response was that
they weren’t interested in the markets’ complexities; simply in
making money on changes in price. Ed and his traders saw through
the smokescreen of untested assumptions and beliefs about what
you need to know about a market and what it takes to make a
successful trading system. This is the difference between knowing a
principle and making its market application. Think about adding to
a position—also known as “pyramiding.” Adding less with each
addition to a position actually creates more gain than adding equal
amounts each time. It’s simple and it’s counterintuitive. Another
way that image on the dollar is a trading tool.
The book you have in front of you bridges this gap between
trading principles and their market application like no other. It may
look like a book, but it is really a set of trading tools—a complete
and detailed application of these principles and others to the
method of trading known as Trend Following.
Author and trader Michael Covel has arranged these master
lessons so that you can approach them according to your personal
preference, or as they call them these days, biases.
The Personalities—In the chapters on great trend followers,
you can read the personal histories of leading traders. You’ll find
there isn’t just one type of successful personality; they range from
college students to real scientists.
The Performance—For the factually minded, in the chapters on
ferformance data and big events in trend following, there is a
succinct summary of historical data from several trend following
funds, along with parallel events in the world.

302 Trend Following (Updated Edition): Learn to Make Millions in Up or Down Markets
The Psychology—For those who think human behavior and
decision making make the difference, there are chapters on each of
these, as well as on emotional intelligence—and how to get it—
followed by the dangers of Holy Grails.
The Trading Systems—The risk, the reward, the key questions
to ask, and the questions Michael is most often asked, along with
commentary from the master trend followers themselves,
encompass these chapters.
The remarkable thing is not that you are looking at this book,
but that it exists at all. Conventional wisdom says buy low and sell
high. Each of us got our education in bargain hunting somewhere
along the line. But what do you do now that your favorite market—
be it a stock, bond, or commodity—is at an all-time high…or low?
For a completely different perspective, from people who actually
make money at this business, take a look inside. Michael Covel has
written a timely and entertaining account of trend following—how
it works, how to do it, and who can do it.

Trend Following A
for Stocks
Cole Wilcox and Eric Crittenden of Blackstar Funds, LLC
graciously supplied all of the research in this appendix about trend
following success on stocks. I view this appendix as a twelfth
chapter, even though it is not labeled that way.
Does Trend Following Work on Stocks?
Introduction
Our firm Blackstar Funds, LLC manages a multi-advisor
commodity pool that invests primarily in systematic1, long
volatility2 programs. We focus mainly on trend following programs
from the commodities, financial futures, and currency trading
arenas, as they tend to be the most systematic in terms of trading
and portfolio management. Years of searching for systematic trend
following programs that focus on stocks, however, have left us
empty handed. Having spent literally thousands of man hours
performing due diligence on trend following funds, along with years
of personal experience trading proprietary capital in stocks, we feel
uniquely qualified to tackle the question, “Does trend following
work on stocks?”
To evaluate the effectiveness of trend following on stocks we
must first determine:
• What stocks will be considered?
• When and how will a stock be purchased?
• When and how will a stock be sold?

Data Integrity
Data Coverage
The database used included 24,000+ individual securities from
the NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ exchanges. Coverage spanned from
January 1983 to December 2004.
Survivorship Bias
The database used for this project included historical data for
all stocks that were delisted at some point between 1983 and 2004.
Slightly more than half of the database is composed of delisted
stocks.
Corporate Actions
All stock prices were proportionately back adjusted for
corporate actions, including cash dividends, splits, mergers, spin-
offs, stock dividends, reverse splits, and so on.
Realistic Investable Universe
A minimum stock price filter was used to avoid penny stocks.3
A minimum daily liquidity filter was used to avoid stocks that would
not have been liquid enough to generate realistic historical results
from. Both filters were evaluated for every stock and for every day
of history in the database, mimicking how results would have
appeared in real time.
A complete discussion of these data integrity issues can be
found at the end of this appendix.
The following chart shows how many stocks would have passed
the previously mentioned filters for each year of historical testing:

Entry and Exit
Entry
For the purposes of this project, the entry method chosen was
the all-time highest close. More specifically, if today’s close is
greater than or equal to the highest close during the stock’s entire
history, then buy tomorrow on the open. We chose this method to
avoid ambiguity. A stock that is at an all time high must be in an
uptrend by any reasonable person’s definition. This is a trend
following entry in its purest form.
The following weekly charts illustrate what would have been
notable trade entries for the system presented in this appendix. The
green dots denote instances where the closing price for the week
was at a new all time high. The horizontal pink line represents the
previous all time high that would have triggered the initial entry:

Appendix A • Trend Following for Stocks 311
Exit (Stops)
Exits are essential to any trend following strategy. We decided
to use average true range trailing stops because they are universally
applicable and commonly used by trend following programs. The
average true is a derivative of the true range indicator, which
measures the daily movement of a security by calculating the
greater of:
• Today’s high minus today’s low
• Today’s high minus yesterday’s close
• Yesterday’s close minus today’s low
The true range illustrates the maximum distance the security’s
price traveled from the close of one business day to the close of the
next business day, capturing overnight gaps and intraday price
swings. The average of this value can be used to integrate the
volatility of a security into a universally applicable trailing stop.
Average true range stops effectively account for volatility
differences between individual securities.
For example, a 10 ATR stop on a volatile Internet stock might
be 55 percent away from the stock price:

Alternatively, a 10 ATR stop on a quiet utility stock might only
be 15 percent away from the stock price:
For the purposes of this project, we chose to exit a stock on the
openthe day after the exit level was breached. The following charts
illustrate how a 10 ATR stop would have looked on some well known
stocks from the past:
Many more graphical illustrations of the stops we used can be
found at the end of this appendix.

the historical database, while honoring the previously mentioned
data integrity issues.
The following distribution shows the results from using an all
time high entry along with a 10-unit ATR stop. There were 18,000+
trades during the 22 year test period. Transaction costs of 0.5
percent round-turn were deducted from each trade to account for
estimated commission and slippage.

Return
rebmuN
The X-axis represents the net return from the trade. The Y-axis
indicates how many trades would have achieved the indicated net
return. The long volatility component resulting from the combi-
nation of a trend following entry and trailing volatility stop is
immediately recognizable by the significant right skew of the distri-
bution. Seventeen percent of trades would have gained 50 percent
or more while less than 3 percent of trades would have registered a
loss equal to or worse than –50 percent.
At first glance, a winning percentage of 49.3 percent might seem
less than impressive, but it is relatively high for a trend following
system. Trend following systems can be very effective with much
lower winning percentages if the profitable trades are significantly
larger than the more frequent unprofitable trades. In the case of this
system, the ratio between average winning trade and average losing
trade is 2.56; a healthy number in our experience.

Appendix A • Trend Following for Stocks 315
A positive mathematical expectancy is the bare minimum
needed to justify the use of or further research of an investing or
trading system. In the case of this system, the weighted average of
the trade results distribution yields an expectancy of approximately
15.2 percent with an average holding period of 305 calendar days.
Considering the significance of the sample size, depth of the sample
period, realistic assumptions used, and the right skewed return
distribution, we felt this was a very solid foundation to build from.
Other settings for the ATR stop were tested, the range spanned
from 8 to 12 with a step increment of 0.5. The middle setting of 10
was chosen for illustration purposes. There were no material
differences in results among the various settings. Higher ATR levels
(looser stops) resulted in slightly higher winning percentages and
slightly lower win/loss ratios. The inverse was true of lower ATR
levels (tighter stops).
The next distribution illustrates a collection of all trades, each
normalized for its own risk. This concept typically requires some
explanation. Every trade ultimately has a recorded percent return.4
Every trade also has a recorded percent initial risk5from the day of
entry. The result is that we know what the percent return of each
trade would have been and we know how much risk each trade
would have subjected us to. The ratio between these two numbers
is the focus of this section.
The simplest way to interpret the following distribution is to
focus on a couple of specific numbers on the X-axis. First the –100
percent column contains trade results where the absolute value of
the net loss approximately equaled the initial risk (lost the full
amount that was expected). Likewise, the 100 percent column
contains trades where the net gain approximately equaled the
initial risk. Results worse than –100 percent represent trades where
we would have lost more than what was budgeted for on the trade
(negative outlier trades). This is usually the result of a large,
overnight price decline. Results greater than 100 percent represent
trades where we would have gained more than what was initially
risked (positive outlier trades). Consider the following two
scenarios:
• We purchase XYZ stock at $15.50. The 10 ATR stop is $11.32.
Initial risk in this case is 27 percent. Two years later, we sell
XYZ at $30.75 for a gain of 98 percent. The ratio between gain

316 Trend Following (Updated Edition): Learn to Make Millions in Up or Down Markets
and initial risk is 3.63 or 363 percent. This data point would
therefore go in the 350 percent column in the following
distribution. The return would have been 363 percent the size
of the initial risk.
• We purchase ABC stock at $32.35. The 10 ATR stop is $26.53.
Initial risk in this case is 18 percent. Three months later the
company misses its earnings estimate and gaps down well
below the stop. We sell ABC at $21.15 for a loss of –35 percent.
The ratio between gain and initial risk is –1.94 or –194 percent.
This data point would therefore go in the –200 percent column.
The loss would have been almost double what was budgeted for.

From the above distribution, one can get a feel for how realistic
a 10 ATR stop is for real-world trading. Data points to the left of
–100 percent reflect trades that couldn’t be controlled. There were
less than 400 trades that caused worse than expected losses. This
amounts to approximately 2 percent of all historical trades.
In some ways, this second distribution is more important than
the first. Normalizing each trade by its own risk reduces the
possibility that highly volatile stocks will unjustifiably dominate the
results.
Having a low number of negative outlier trades can lead to a
false sense of security. If all or most of the negative outlier trades
come in one year, the results can be far worse than what was

short-selling6 strategies. Our reasons for this have to do with the
following issues.
Forced Buy-Ins
A short seller has to borrow shares before they can short sell
them. Likewise, the short seller must return (deliver) the shares
should the brokerage firm call them back. From the historical data
available, there is no way to know when or if a short seller would
have been subject to a forced buy-in.7
Borrowing Shares
Short selling a security requires borrowing shares from an
investor who holds them in a margin account. Not all stocks meet
these criteria all the time; some never meet these criteria at all.
There is no reliable method to determine what stocks from the
investable universe would have been realistically shortable in the
past.
Limited Expectancy
With respect to long-term trend following, short selling offers a
severely limited mathematical expectancy. The price of a stock can
decline only by a maximum of 100 percent. However, it can rise by
an infinite amount. This is a significant disability to overcome.
Tax Efficiency
The average hold time for the average trade came in lower than
the 12 months necessary to qualify for long-term capital gains
treatment. However, due to the nature of trend following systems in
general, this statistic is misleading. There was a significant
correlation between trade length and profitability, showing that the
vast majority of historical profits would have qualified for long-term
capital gains treatment.

Conclusions
The evidence suggests that trend following can work well on
stocks. Buying stocks at new all time highs and exiting them after
they’ve fallen below a 10 ATR trailing stop would have yielded a
significant return on average. The evidence also suggests that such
trading would not have resulted in significant tax burdens relative
to buy-and-hold investing. Test results show the potential for
diversification exceeding that of the typical mutual fund. The trade
results distribution shows significant right skew, indicating that
large outlier trades would have been concentrated among winning
trades rather than losing trades. At this stage, we are comfortable
answering the question, “Does trend following work on stocks?”
The evidence strongly suggests that it does.
Further Research
The research described so far in this appendix was only a small
initial step in a complex process. Portfolio level money management
is absolutely essential to the success of a trend following system.
Controlling risk at the portfolio level encompasses initial position
sizing, scaling into and out of individual positions, total open risk
constraints, and so on.
Having determined that a significant positive mathematical
expectancy does exist for long-term trend following on stocks, we
took the next step and implemented our proprietary portfolio and
risk management process.

Although a complete discussion is beyond the scope of this
appendix, the following hypothetical returns reflect the application
of the portfolio management system we use to manage client and
proprietary capital.
The mechanics behind our portfolio management system are
not disclosed; however, the system strictly adheres to the following
principles:
• Losing trades are never added to.
• Winning trades are reduced only to alleviate risk concentrations.
• New entries are never skipped.
• Stop losses are always honored.
• Total open risk at the portfolio level is always limited to a
specific number.

Appendix 4: Data IntegrityIssues
The scope of this projectincluded all stocks that traded on U.S.
exchanges (AMEX, NYSE, and NASDAQ) from 1983 to year end
2004. This amounted to more than 24,000 securities spanning 22
years.
Delisted Stocks, Symbol Overlap, and Unique Identifiers
In our experience, a very common mistake made in testing
stock trading strategies is the failure to understand and deal with
the reality that actively traded securities existed for companies that
have since gone out of business or have been acquired by other
companies. These securities will not show up in most databases.
Only the securities of “surviving” companies will show up in the
typical database or charting service. To account for this survivor-
ship bias, delisted companies were included in our universe.
Because current companies sometimes use ticker symbols that
were previously used by former (since delisted) companies, a
unique serial number was necessary to identify each stock.
At the time of this writing, the entire database showed 24,057
individual securities. However, only 11,384 securities were active
on U.S. exchanges. This left 12,673 securities that did exist
historically but do not exist now. Most databases will omit these
12,673 securities, leading to erroneous results from any kind of
historical testing. In the interest of accuracy, we chose to include
these data in our testing.
The following illustrations are examples of companies whose
shares became worthless and are thus not reflected in most of
today’s databases:

Appendix A • Trend Following for Stocks 327
Adjustments for Corporate Actions (stock-splits, dividends, mergers, and so on)
Another common mistake made in testing stock-trading
strategies is the failure to understand and deal with corporate
actions. Most notably, databases and charting services often ignore
cash dividends. This is unfortunate because a cash dividend is part
of a shareholder’s return on investment. Stocks almost always “gap
down” by the amount of the dividend on the ex-dividend date.9The
following illustrations show two different charts for the same
security over the same time frame. The first is not adjusted for
dividends and shows that Cousins Properties gapped down $6.65 on
November 19, 2004, resulting in a one-day loss of 19.5 percent.

                     PAGE 355                     
==================================================

328 Trend Following (Updated Edition): Learn to Make Millions in Up or Down Markets
The second chart is adjusted for dividends and shows that
Cousins Properties finished the day with a mild loss of only –1.3
percent. It turns out that November 19, 2004 was the ex-dividend
date, the day after the owner of record has been determined
regarding the $7.15 dividend.



==================================================
                     PAGE 356                     
==================================================

Appendix A • Trend Following for Stocks 329
In reality, the security did gap down $6.65 and did trade even
lower to close down –$7.66 for the day. But the owner of the
security did not incur a 19.5 percent loss. Rather, the owner of the
security became the beneficiary of a $7.15 dividend, and thus
his/her return on investment should be calculated as a loss of 1.3
percent for the day. For the purposes of historical testing, this can
be done by proportionally back adjusting previous price data down
by a value equal to the amount of the dividend divided by the close
on the day preceding the ex-dividend date.
Failure to adjust for dividends causes more than just erroneous
profit and loss results. If you are using mathematically derived
entries and exits for trading purposes, non-adjusted data will
corrupt the logic of your system. For example, consider two
investors starting their programs in December 2004. Both investors
utilize the same strategy where a stock is purchased if it breaks out
to a new 5-year high. Investor A is not using dividend-adjusted data
and must wait for Cousins Properties to break out above $39.81.
Investor B is using dividend-adjusted data and thus would be buying
on a breakout above $31.62.
We will argue that Investor A is unnecessarily waiting for a price
of $39.81. Investor B is correct to use a price of $31.62 as a key
breakout point because it is not possible for any investor to have a
loss in the investment above this price level. Any investor who
purchased at higher prices and still owns the stock would have also
been the shareholder of record prior to the ex-dividend date and
would have received the $7.15 dividend.
The following illustrations highlight the significance of failure to
adjust for dividends in high yielding stocks:



==================================================
                     PAGE 357                     
==================================================

330 Trend Following (Updated Edition): Learn to Make Millions in Up or Down Markets
The same error impacts exits (stops) in a similar manner. A
casual glance at the first chart of Cousins Properties clearly shows
significant volatility that is a function only of a corporate action, not
of monetary losses. This “phantom” volatility can result in your exit
price being breached when it otherwise would not have been, as
well as negatively impacting risk-adjusted return metrics.
A price chart supplied by the typical database or charting
service often does not tell the whole story. Failure to adjust for cash
dividends will result in an understatement of the profitability of
owning dividend paying stocks. This error is a direct function of the
dividend yield of the security in question; the higher the yield, the
greater the error. Failure to adjust for cash dividends will also
overstate the profitability of any short-selling strategies because the
short seller (who must borrow shares to short) is responsible for
compensating the actual owner of the shares for any dividends paid.
Entries, exits, and subsequent profitability estimates are all
impacted by any failure to properly adjust for cash dividends.
For the previous reasons, we have proportionately back
adjusted our entire database for cash dividends, stock dividends,
stock splits, reverse splits, and various other types of corporate
actions.

Appendix A • Trend Following for Stocks 331
Realistic Universe of Tradable Securities
A database consisting of all stocks that traded on U.S.
exchanges since 1983 will include thousands of penny stocks and
securities that were simply too illiquid to generate trustworthy
historical test results from. For this reason, we created “minimum
stock price” and “minimum average daily dollar volume” filters to
limit our trading universe. Non-adjusted historical closing price and
volume data are required to calculate both. If you’ll recall from the
last section on dividend adjusted data, the adjustment process
artificially deflates historical prices in order to keep daily percent
changes in line with what an investor would have realized. The
higher the dividend yield, the more deflated the price series
becomes during proportional back adjustment.
Having non-adjusted price information available makes it
possible, through the use of formulas, to utilize “minimum stock
price” and “minimum average daily dollar volume” filters historically
as the trades actually would have been executed or rejected.
We chose $15 as the “minimum stock price.” It was not a
scientific decision. Rather, it was based on our current policy to
avoid very low priced stocks. Low priced stocks tend to have
relatively high statistical volatility and little institutional following.
That being said, the “minimum stock price” filter was made to be
dynamic, accepting stocks that climbed higher than $15 and
rejecting stocks that fell to below $15. The “minimum average daily
dollar volume” was chosen, in current terms, to be $500,000 for
NYSE and AMEX listed securities; $1,000,000 for NASDAQ
securities. This minimum value was back adjusted, in terms of time,
with a decay rate equal to that of inflation, as defined by the
consumer price index. For example, the “minimum average daily
dollar volume” for an NYSE or AMEX security would have been
$270,000 in 1983.
The Capitalism Distribution: Observations of Individual
Common Stock Returns, 1983–2006
When most people think of the stock market they do so in
terms of index results such as the S&P 500 or Russell 3000. They
are unaware of the massive differences between successful stocks
and failed stocks “under the hood” of their favorite index.

• 39 percent of stocks were unprofitable investments.
• 18.5 percent of stocks lost at least 75 percent of their value.
• 64 percent of stocks underperformed the Russell 3000.
• 25 percent of stocks were responsible for all of the market’s gains.
• High performance stocks all tended to have one thing in
common.
We make the case for the Capitalism Distribution, a nonnormal
distribution with very fat tails that reflects the observed realities of
long-term individual common stock returns.
Our database covers all common stocks that traded on the
NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ since 1983, including delisted stocks.
Stock and index returns were calculated on a total return basis
(dividends reinvested). Dynamic point-in-time liquidity filters were
used to limit our universe to the approximately 8,000 (due to index
reconstitution, delisting, mergers, and so on) stocks that would
have qualified for membership in the Russell 3000 at some point in
their lifetime. The Russell 3000 Indexmeasures the performance of
the largest 3,000 U.S. companies representing approximately 98
percent of the investable U.S. equity market.

You may be wondering how the Russell 3000 index can have an
overall positive rate of return if the average annualized return for all
stocks is negative. The answer is mostly a function of the index
construction methodology. The Russell 3000 is market
capitalization weighted. This means that successful companies
(rising stock prices) receive larger weightings in the index.
Likewise, unsuccessful companies (declining stock prices) receive
smaller weightings. Eventually unsuccessful companies are
removed from the index (delisted), making way for growing
companies. In this way, market capitalization weighted indexation
is like a simple trend following system that rewards success and
punishes failure.

Compounded Annual Returns for Individual Stocks

It’s also important to point out that stocks with a negative
annualized return had shorter life spans than their successful
counterparts. The average life span of a losing stock was 6.85 years
versus 9.23 years for winning stocks (many of which are still living
right now), meaning that losing stocks have shorter periods of time
to negatively impact index returns. For these reasons, the average
annualized return is probably a somewhat deceptive number for the
purposes of modeling the “typical” stock, but interesting
nonetheless.
The astute reader, at this point, is probably wondering if
outperforming large capitalization stocks explain the observed
distributions. Mathematically this would make sense. Small cap
stocks certainly outnumber large cap stocks, while large cap stocks
dominate the index weightings. However, while large cap stocks
(Russell 1000) have outperformed small cap stocks (Russell 2000)
over the long term, it has been by less than 1 percent per year,
certainly not enough to explain our observations.

produced from all stocks. The conclusion is that if an investor was
somehow unlucky enough to miss the 25 percent most profitable
stocks and instead invested in the other 75 percent, his/her total
gain from 1983 to 2007 would have been 0 percent. In other words,
a minority of stocks are responsible for the majority of the market’s
gains.

We identified the best performing stocks on both an annualized
return and total return basis and studied them extensively. The
biggest winning stocks on an annualized return basis had a
moderate tendency to be technology stocks and most (60 percent)
were bought out by another company or a private equity firm; not
surprising.
Some of the biggest winners on a total return basis were
companies that had been acquired. Examples include Sun America,
Warner Lambert, Gillette, Golden West Financial, and Harrah’s
Entertainment. However, most (68 percent) are still trading today.
Not surprisingly, they are almost exclusively large cap companies.

However, further research suggests that they weren’t large
companies when they were enjoying the bulk of their cumulative
returns. Becoming a large cap is simply the natural result of
significant price appreciation above and beyond that of the other
stocks in the market. We were not able to detect any sector
tendencies. The biggest winners on a total return basis were simply
the minority that outperformed their peers.
Both the biggest winners on annualized return and total return
basis tended to have one thing in common while they were
accumulating market beating gains. Relative to average stocks, they
spent a disproportionate amount of time making new multi-year
highs. Stock ABC can’t typically travel from $20 to $300 without
first crossing $30 and $40. Such a stock is going to spend a lot of
time making new highs. Likewise, the worst performing stocks
tended to spend zero time making new multi-year highs while they
were accumulating losses. Instead, relative to average stocks, they
tended to spend a disproportionate amount of time at multi-year
lows.
Mathematically, it makes perfect sense. Stocks that generate
thousands of percent returns will hit new highs hundreds of times,
usually over the course of many years.

traits that tend to distinguish successful traders from less successful
ones. Several of these traits are also likely to influence the degree
of success traders are likely to have in adopting a trend following
approach to trading. Following are several self-assessment
questions that might be useful in determining whether you’ll face
particularly great challenges in riding market trends. Please write
down “yes” or “no” answers to each of the 12 questions before
reading further:
1. When something goes against you in the market, do you often
find yourself venting your frustration?
2. Do you enjoy (or as a child did you enjoy) roller coasters or
other thrill rides?
3. Do you often find yourself procrastinating over work?
4. Do you consider yourself moody—sometimes rather up, some-
times rather down?
5. Would you generally prefer going out and partying with friends
rather than staying at home with a good book or movie?

12. Are you often late for appointments or for social plans you’ve

If you indicated “yes” tomost or all of questions 1, 4, 7, and 10,
you most likely score high on a trait called “neuroticism.”
Neuroticism is the tendency toward negative emotional experience,
and it shows up as anger, anxiety, or depression.
If you responded “yes” to most or all of questions 2, 5, 8 and 11,
you probably score high on a trait called “openness to experience.”
Openness reflects a tendency toward sensation seeking and risk-
taking.
If you answered “yes” to most or all of questions 3, 6, 9, and 12,
you potentially score low on a trait called “conscientiousness.”
Conscientiousness measures the degree to which an individual is
oriented toward duty, responsibility, and dependability.
Other things being equal, the ideal personality pattern for trend
following is one of high conscientiousness, low neuroticism, and low
openness. A good trend follower sticks with rules and systems
(conscientious), won’t impulsively enter or exit trades on the whim
of emotion (neuroticism), and will trade for profits, not stimulation
(low openness). In my experience, some of the best systems traders
are among the least flashy people. They are meticulous and
conscientious about their research and execution, and they don’t
let their emotions or needs pull them from their discipline.
Conversely, individuals who are high risk-takers and who crave
novelty, stimulation, and action often take impulsive and

imprudent risks. Frequently, the neurotic emotions kick in after a
series of losing high-risk trades. Such individuals are trading for
excitement and self-validation, not just profits. Even if they are
given a tested, profitable trading system, they will not be able to
follow it faithfully.

may benefit from trading a greater number of stocks or markets
rather than focusing on a relative few. Are some personalities
simply unsuited for trading? I would say yes, just as some
personalities are not cut out to be fighter pilots or surgeons. It is
difficult to imagine a trader enjoying ongoing success without the
capacity for disciplined risk-taking.
It is not at all unusual to find that a trader is losing with a trend
following approach because he acts out unmet personality needs in
the market. One of the best trading strategies one can employ is to
find adequate outlets for attention and affection, achievement, self-
esteem, emotional well being, and excitement outside of trading.
Sometimes traders I talk with try to impress me by explaining that
trading is their entire life. They do not realize that their very
“passion” and “obsession” with the markets are likely to sabotage
them, imposing undue pressures and interference. If you have a
trading system and you faithfully execute that system, trading
should be reasonably boring and routine. Better to enjoy roller
coasters outside of market hours than ride them with your equity
curve!

magnitude events. The diagonal line slopes upward to infinity.
Trend followers do not predict the extent of price changes but seek
to capture large outsize moves over significant periods of time. The
horizontal line represents the truncation of risk by stop placement
and can be likened to paying a finite premium for an option.
Mulvaney notes that trend following does not rely on a unidirec-
tional, single-market position as buy-and-hold stock investing does.
A single trend following model has multiple sources of return,
morphing itself into whatever and wherever the market is. As you

profitable systems cannot be designed, just that mean
returns cannot be estimated, in a strict econometric sense.
This observation underpins a ‘run profits’ strategy. By
contrast, systematic profit-taking at calculated objectives is
a form of mean estimation and is untenable. On the other
hand, the volatility of financial and commodity markets
changes over time and exhibits autocorrelation. Returns of
like magnitude tend to be clustered over time. Volatility
tends to come in waves, so that financial markets are
characterized by tranquil and volatile periods. Large price
changes tend to be followed by large changes and small
changes by small changes, but of either sign. As a result,
predictive models for volatility can be derived. In modeling
terms, this means we do estimate the volatility of returns,
detecting nascent trends when price changes exceed
previous volatility estimates and a tail starts to form.”

“Part of back-testing is to determine position
sizing and risk management strategies that fit
within your drawdown tolerance envelope.”
—EdSeykota1
In this appendix, Bob Spear shows how a trader might construct Grow your own dope—
a simple, mechanical trend following system on Trading Recipes plant an economist.
Portfolio Engineering Software. His newest software, surpassing Graffiti seen at London School of
Economics
Trading Recipes, is called Mechanica (www.mechanicasoftware.
com).
For this example we start with a broad look at the system’s
trading ideas, which echo many of the ideas discussed in this book.
We construct a hypothetical portfolio and run a backtest up to a
certain point in time. Then, we examine in detail how the software
enters, sizes, and manages a trade. Afterwards, we run our backtest
to the end of our data and examine the results without and with
money management.
Please note that we provide this information to illustrate a
concept; I do not necessarily recommend that anyone “trade” this
system, nor do we offer it as trading advice.
System Background Information
Our sample trend following system enters on an 89-day price
breakout and exits on a 13-day price breakdown, bets 2 percent of
equity on every trade, and implements a mechanism to ensure that

we don’t risk too much. This system is run over a small portfolio of

performance, but we did not put the portfolio used here under a
microscope.

code used in Trading Recipes to generate entry and exit signals and
to size positions (money management). Please note that words in

comments.
SYSTEM = 1 'unique ID # for this system
COL1 = ATR[15] '15-day avg true range of current market
MANAGER[1] = COL1[1] * POINTVALUE 'dollar value of that volatility
COL2 = MAX[H,89,1] + TICK[1] '89-day breakout for long entry
COL3 = MIN[L,13,1] – TICK[1] '13-day breakdown for long exit
COL4 = MIN[L,89,1] – TICK[1] '89-day breakout for short entry
COL5 = MAX[H,13,1] + TICK[1] '13-day breakdown for short exit
Each day, we calculate the following values.
As it processes each day of each market, our system will search for a breakout to enter
a trade (long or short):
BUYSTOP = COL2 'long entry stop
SELLSTOP = COL4 'short entry stop
If an entry signal is generated, the system executes position-sizing rules to determine
how many contracts (futures) or shares (equities) to trade.
In the rules that follow, you can see that we risk 2 percent of our equity on each trade.
However, we trade conservatively in that we trade the lesser quantity of contracts as
calculated by 2 percent divided by new risk (defined as the dollar value of the absolute
value of [entry – stop]) or 2 percent divided by twice the dollar value of 15-day average
volatility.

A Canadian Dollar Trade
Let’s follow a Canadian Dollar trade to see exactly how our
trend following system enters, sizes, and exits a trade.
On December 14, 1994, the Canadian Dollar hit an 89-day low
(as represented by the line in the midst of the price bars) intraday.
Because our trend following system had a sell stop “on the floor,”
the order was filled and the system went short. (See Chart F.2.)
CHART F.2: Short Entry December 12, 1994
It indicates the trailing stop (a 13-day high) via the line above
the price bars. While in a trade, Trading Recipes compares daily
data to that line. If a day’s price range touches that line, as it does
on January 31, 1995, then the exit stop is hit and a buy order is
generated to cover the short.

==================================================

Appendix F • Trading System Example from Mechanica 389
How was the position sized? Let’s review our sizing rules in the
context of the equity level when the entry signal was generated.
After our portfolio was marked-to-market at the close on
December 13, 1994, we had $2,205,963 in equity. As it sizes the
Canadian Dollar entry, our system calculates the following values
(please note that a 1.0 move in the Canadian Dollar is worth
$100,000 per our data setup):
MEMORY[1] = (TOTALEQUITY * .02) / NEWRISK
Where TOTALEQUITY = $2,205,963
TOTALEQUITY * .02 = $44,119.26
NEWRISK = ABS(.7273 – .7392) * $100,000 = $1190
Thus MEMORY[1] = $44,119.26 / $1190 = 37.0750084
MEMORY[2] = (TOTALEQUITY * .02) / (MANAGER[1] * 2)
Where TOTALEQUITY = $2,205,963
TOTALEQUITY * .02 = $44,119.26
MANAGER[1] = .0023 * $100,000 = $230
MANAGER[1] * 2 = $460
Thus MEMORY[2] = $44,119.26 / $460 = 95.91143478
IF MEMORY[1] < MEMORY[2] THEN MEMORY[2] = MEMORY[1]
Where MEMORY[1] is indeed < MEMORY[2], so MEMORY[2] = 37.0750084
IF MEMORY[2] > 100 THEN MEMORY[2] = 100
Where the condition evaluates to false
NEWCONTRACTS = MEMORY[2]
Where Trading Recipes rounds down and sizes the position at 37 contracts
By taking the smaller of two possible position sizes, this
example illustrates clearly one of the maxims of trend following: Bet
conservatively so that you might live to see another day.

Critical Questions
for Trading G
Systems
There are many questions you should ask when building and There can never be
testing a trend following trading system. Here are a few: surprises in logic.
LudwigWittgenstein1
1. What are the largest actual and simulated drawdowns
experienced? What was the maximal loss in equity—simulated
and actual—in a single day?
2. What is the maximum number of consecutive losing months
the system has sustained?
3. How often do drawdowns occur?
4. Are drawdowns typically short-lived, or do they develop
gradually?
5. On the average, how long does it take to recover all losses
incurred during a drawdown? What is the longest it has taken
to complete a recovery from the trough of a drawdown?
6. Is the risk of each trade quantified? If so, what variables are
included when making the calculation? Is the procedure
accomplished by the computer or “by hand?”
7. How is the overall risk controlled?
8. Are there circumstances under which all trading could be
halted to avoid further losses? If so, what are they? If not, why
not?
9. Are there markets in which the trading system consistently
performed poorly? If so, why does it not work well in those
markets?

For more than 30 years, trend following has been the one trading strategy that’s
consistently delivered extraordinary profits in bull and bear markets. While most
investors were losing a fortune in the 2008 stock market collapse, stuck in
buy and hold investments, trend followers were earning huge profits…up to
a whopping +40% in the single month of October 2008! The proof’s in this book:
brand-new data you can view for yourself, plus all the information you need
to know to utilize the same timeless strategies in your portfolio.
In this fully updated edition, trend following expert Michael Covel introduces
the traders and fund managers who’ve been using this strategy for decades,
adding brand-new profiles such as David Harding, who manages $10 billion
plus dollars through his London-based trend following firm. Then, Covel walks you
through all the concepts and techniques you need to use trend following yourself.
One step at a time, one simple chart at a time, you’ll learn how to understand price
movements well enough to profit from them consistently—in any market.
Today, you need trend following more than ever. Read this book, and put it to
work for you!
