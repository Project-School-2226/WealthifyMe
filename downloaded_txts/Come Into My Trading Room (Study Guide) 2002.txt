STUDY GUIDE FOR
COME INTO
MY TRADING ROOM
Think of the millions of people who throw money at stocks, options,
and futures. Probably less than one percent of them ever pick up a
trading book. Only a tiny fraction of those perform any learning exer-
cises or take tests. If you can work through this Study Guide, grade your
performance, then study and retake some of the tests if necessary, you
will belong to a small sophisticated minority.
It is easy to sit at a lecture, sagely nod your head, and think you
understand everything. What if someone asks you a question about that
lecture a week or a month later? Will you be able to answer, or will you
have forgotten by then?
It took me three years to write Come into My Trading Room, yet a
person can read it in just a few days. Do you expect to get full value out
of it after a quick read? Or will you return, reread, review, and under-
line key sections and paragraphs? I created this Study Guide to help
you grasp the main ideas in my book, expose blind spots, and achieve
a deeper degree of understanding.
Do not rush yourself through this workbook.Take the tests one chap-
ter at a time and keep returning to the original source until you get that
chapter right. Then move to the next one. There is nothing wrong with
taking several weeks to work through this book. Quality is more impor-
tant than speed.

HOW THIS BOOK
IS ORGANIZED
The first section, Financial Trading for Babes in the Woods, quizzes you
on the essential basics of trading. It asks about the efficient market the-
ory, account size, and external barriers to winning, as well as market
data and types of analysis. Rate your answers on the scales that are pro-
vided in each chapter. If you get a high grade, move on to the next
chapter, but if your score is low, return to the main book and work
through the basics before going any further.
Once you have covered the basics, it is time to move on to the three
M’s of successful trading, starting with the first—Mind. Questions in the
second chapter deal with trading psychology, causes of losing, trading
attitude, and, of course, discipline. Rate your answers on the scale. If
your score is high, move on; otherwise, return to the main book. Many
brilliant people fail in trading; no technical tools can help those whose
minds are not in gear with the markets.
The second M—Method—is covered in several chapters. First, the
chapter on basic charting quizzes you on classical technical analysis.
The next chapter, on indicators, delves into moving averages, channels,
MACD, Force Index, Elder-ray, and Stochastic. The next chapter, on trad-
ing, asks questions about system testing, timeframes, and Triple Screen.
Feel free to skip the chapter on day-trading if you do not day-trade.
Finally, there is a chapter that asks about new, revolutionary methods
presented in the main book—the Impulse System and SafeZone stops.
Money management is the key skill that separates winners from los-
ers. This chapter quizzes you about the 2% and the 6% Rules, mathe-
matical expectation and position sizing. Make sure you answer each
question right, and if not, return to the main book. Nothing less than a
perfect score is acceptable in this chapter!

4 HOW THIS BOOK IS ORGANIZED
We conclude the Study Guide with a chapter called The Organized
Trader. A person who is serious about his success has to organize his
decision-making process and record-keeping. Questions in this chapter
deal with trading records such as the equity curve, trading spreadsheet,
and trader’s diary. They cover time management, setting priorities, and
rating your performance.
The charts in the Study Guide go beyond illustrating key analytic
points. Each comes with questions about what you would do at the right
edge. Signals tend to be clearly visible in the middle of the chart, but
grow foggy as you get closer to the hard right edge. That’s where you
have to make trading decisions, in the atmosphere of uncertainty. This
Study Guide is designed to train you to decide at that crucial barrier
where people make or lose money.
Take your time as you go through the questions and exercises. Some
questions may be hard, but hang on and work through them. A boot camp
may feel overwhelming to a soldier, but it is designed to toughen him, so
that he may survive the battle and come back alive and victorious.

FINANCIAL TRADING FOR
BABES IN THE WOODS
Trading is serious business, no less so than building a house or teach-
ing calculus. Being smart and having good ideas is not enough for win-
ning. You must understand the mechanics of the markets and the
essential principles of analysis and risk control.
You need to learn the key facts and rules before entering your first
trade. The first chapter of the Study Guidetests your knowledge of some
of those concepts. Answer these eight questions and write down your
answers. Go to the Answers section, check your responses, and then
enter your grade for each answer in the first column of the spreadsheet.
There are five columns to enable you to return at a later date, retake the
test, compare your results, and measure your progress.

MIND—
THE DISCIPLINED TRADER
Your personality is the key component of your trading success. Your
thoughts, feelings, and attitudes have an immediate and direct impact on
what happens to your account and whether it rises or falls. No level of
computer power and no amount of technical expertise will do a trader
any good if his mind is unsettled.
One day, if you get the chance, rent Solaris, a film by the late, great
director Andrei Tarkovski. In this sci-fi film, a planet that has been
bombarded by the scientists responds by reaching into their minds,
extracting their most painful memories, and recreating those experi-
ences for them. They must come to terms with those memories and
resolve their old conflicts before becoming capable of getting in touch
with the planet. Markets act like that planet in the sense that they
reach deep into our minds, find our weaknesses, and hit us in our
weak spots.
Greed, fear, carelessness, sloth, and other sins of omission or com-
mission make successful trading difficult or impossible for most peo-
ple. You have to look into the mirror, record your actions, recognize
what you are doing wrong, and then correct your attitudes. Becoming
a successful trader means becoming a more balanced and mature
human being.

BASIC CHARTING
Trading without charts is like playing poker without looking at the
cards. It is important to learn to read charts because they can tell you a
great deal about the never-ending battle between bulls and bears. If you
want to track their moves, you have to be able to read their footprints
on your charts.
Two city slickers go for a walk in the woods, and one says, “Look,
there are bear tracks.” “Don’t be silly,” says the other, “those are bull
tracks.” And that’s when the train hit them. Anyone can see the tracks,
but it takes knowledge and experience to recognize to whom they
belong.
Once you learn to recognize price patterns in the middle of a chart,
start shifting your attention to the right edge. The middle is where you
learn, the right edge is where you trade. Making decisions at the right
edge means acting while the information is not yet complete. Being
able to recognize the picture from just a few details is a hallmark of a
professional trader. It is also the reason why automatic trading tends
not to work. Machines are not as good as humans when it comes to
making decisions on the basis of incomplete information. Needless
to say, your risk control has to be very good to allow you to act at the
right edge.

INDICATORS—
FIVE BULLETS TO A CLIP
Why walk if you can drive? Why dig with a pick and shovel if an exca-
vator is available? Modern computerized analysis allows traders to
review more markets in greater depth and make more objective deci-
sions than classical charting.
Computerized analysis does not guarantee success any more than hav-
ing modern construction equipment guarantees building a sturdy house.
You have to know how to use your tools. Draw the line between magic—
buying someone else’s collection of tools and hoping for a profitable
outcome—and your own work of digging for good trading ideas using
modern computerized tools.
A modern laptop packs more power than the first computers, which
required special air-conditioned rooms and teams of service techni-
cians. Modern technical analysis software is growing cheaper and
more powerful each month. A serious trader owes it to himself to learn
computerized analysis, whose primary tools are technical indicators.

TRADING
Beginning traders tend to stumble into several pitfalls. Many jump into
the markets without knowing enough about trading. Some make a few
dollars thanks to beginners’ luck, but practically all beginners end up
losing money. That’s when they hit the books—and more and more
books, afraid to pull the trigger, with lingering memories of the beating
they received. A beaten trader who concentrates on market analysis but
does not trade is suffering from “paralysis from analysis.”
An intelligent trader realizes that his or her knowledge of the market
can never be complete. The markets are huge, influenced by many fac-
tors, and have a fair bit of uncertainty. There is no such thing as perfect
understanding. Once the preponderance of signals from your indicators
points to a trade, it is time to calculate the risks, set stops, and put on
the trade, without waiting for a perfect signal, which is likely to come
too late anyway.

DAY-TRADING
Day-trading is much harder than most people think. Beginners stumbling
into this field usually get the same financial result as from playing three-
card monte on the street. The cards get shuffled a little too fast, the
expense of getting in and out is a little too high, the player’s attention
flags just a little, and soon another day-trading wannabe bites the dust.
Day-trading demands instant reactions and the highest degree of dis-
cipline, but, paradoxically, tends to attract the most impulsive and hyper-
active people. It demands a total concentration on short-term swings,
and most people simply cannot focus their attention long enough.
Still, day-trading has its uses, even for longer-term traders. If you know
how to day-trade, you can use those techniques to slide into and out of
your positions. Once you do that, turn off your real-time screen and focus
on longer-term charts. Be sure to keep the two types of trading apart—do
not convert position trades into day-trades and vice versa.

ADVANCED CONCEPTS
To succeed in trading, you need an advantage over your competitors.
The best edge is a very high level of discipline. Another good edge
comes from a deeper level of understanding of the markets. This is usu-
ally based on having unusual and original analytic tools, that are not
available to the mass of traders.
Successful traders tend to rely on private tools and techniques, or else
they use commonly known tools in uncommon ways. Here we will
review two new methods—the Impulse System for finding trades and
SafeZone for placing stops. We will also look at the derivatives—
options and futures. A beginner is better off staying away from them and
learning to trade stocks, but an experienced trader may expand his area
of interest to include derivatives.

MONEY MANAGEMENT
The third M of successful trading, Money, is certainly the most neglected.
Beginners spend a lot of time and energy trying to learn Methods, and
more experienced traders worry about their discipline and other topics
of the Mind, but only the pros pay enough attention to Money.
A professional understands that whether he trades an Internet high-
flyer, soybean futures, or IBM calls, he is ultimately trading money. Any
specific market is just a vehicle that may bring him a higher return than
a bank. This is why counting money is no less important—perhaps more
important—than counting indicator readings.
Have you noticed how, in trading, everything that can go wrong
tends to go wrong? There are legions of people making a living in the
markets, and they make money when you stumble. Every imaginable
banana peel gets thrown in your path. To protect yourself from losses,
you need to establish and religiously observe money management rules.
Money management provides a safety net on your journey to that
appealing land where you will be free because you trade for a living. If
you have a reasonably good method for analyzing the markets and find-
ing trades, you will succeed, if—and this is a very big if—you can protect
your capital along the way.
To underscore the extreme importance of money management, your
answers will be graded differently in this chapter. There will be no
“fairly good” rating. You must obtain an Excellent score because the
only other rating is Poor. Poor in more ways than one.

N I N E
THE ORGANIZED TRADER
If you have worked through this book so far, you appreciate that trading
is a serious pursuit. It requires the utmost concentration, attention, and
dedication. You may mean well, but how can you be sure that your
actions follow your intentions? You want to avoid having to say, like a
former Russian prime minister, “We wanted the best, but got the usual.”
Or, as my grandfather used to say, “The road to Hell is paved with good
intentions.”
The only way to tell whether you are on the right track is by keeping
good notes. Show me a trader with good notes, and I will show you a
good trader.
Keeping extensive records and reviewing them is a lot less fun than
swinging in the markets, buying here and selling there. Good records
provide the best running test of your level of discipline. If you score
high on that test—not just in this book, but after you are finished work-
ing with it, in your own trading—you should do well and succeed in
trading for a living.
Grading in this chapter, as in the Money Management chapter, is
different from the rest of this book. This topic is so important that there
is no “fairly good” rating. You must keep learning until you score
Excellent.

Researching a stock’s prospects and its industry group is a hallmark
of a serious investor. An insider is the ultimate investor, albeit a crimi-
nal, because he is acting on a fundamental factor likely to move a stock.
The closeness of insider trading to fundamental analysis is an endless
source of embarrassment for many brokerage firms. A trader focuses on
the response of prices to the fundamental data, including mass hysteria.
A gambler who gets his tips from some famous guru on TV is still a gam-
bler because he chases hot leads instead of thinking for himself.

Traders often focus on feelings rather than maximizing profits. A
trader who buys a runaway stock out of fear of missing a good thing is
hardly being rational. Professionals do not expect to win in every trade
and are aware of a great deal of noise and uncertainty in the markets;
they do expect to be profitable in the long run, thanks to steady disci-
plined trading. When a group agrees that a certain trade looks good, it
is usually time to go the other way because groups tend to be more
emotional than individuals. Boiling markets are less rational, creating
opportunities for calm pros; quiet markets are more efficient, making it
more difficult to take money from others.

Any fool can enter a trade (and often does), but it takes knowledge
and experience to find good exit points. Entries have to be planned in
advance. An intelligent trader decides he will enter after the market
does what he expects it to do, and then waits for all his ducks to get in
a row. A momentum trader tries to catch an impulse move, a counter-
trend trader a return to value; both methods can be profitable, as long
as you know clearly what it is you are trying to do each time. While
analyzing prices and indicators, you should not forget that money
management is the essential element of trading; each trade has to be
chosen in accordance with strict money management rules.

Options are deadly for most buyers who must jump through three
hoops, correctly choosing the vehicle, price, and time. A stock makes
you a part owner of a business, whereas both futures and options deal
in contracts for future delivery and allow you to get out of your com-
mitment before the due date. A trader with no money management
skills will lose in every market, but his loss will come sooner in options
or futures than in stocks. The trend is your friend in every market; there
is no point in buying when prices are falling.

An important survival factor is the maximum percentage of the account
risked on any given trade. It would take a string of 50 losses to knock
traders 4 and 5 out of the game, but a mere five losses can dispatch

Earnings are important, but the market’s reaction to them is even
more telling. When a stock refuses to decline after a bad earnings
report, it shows that the bottom is near. A steep drop after a mildly dis-
appointing earnings report indicates further weakness ahead. Futures
can fall below the cost of production when desperate producers dump
their overstock, but they cannot stay there for long. Real-time data only
distracts beginners, as does watching a multitude of markets. Weekly
charts provide the essential long-term perspective, while the best soft-
ware in the hands of a yahoo is useless because knowledge and skills
carry more weight than any tools.

Fundamental analysts study supply and demand, which drive prices
in the long run. Market technicians try to read the behavior of the mar-
ket crowd. Both can be used for making trading decisions, although
fundamentals are more important for long-term investors and technicals
for short-term traders. Neither predicts future prices; they tell you what
is happening in the markets now and leave you to decide how to play
the odds for the future. Neither can be automated any more than den-

A professional trader stands apart from the crowd and makes his own
decisions. When the market throws him a curve, he doesn’t blame any-

edge from having plans for rallies and declines, allowing him to move
ahead and act, while others are just starting to figure out what to do. He

methods, while he knows that the key to winning is discipline, which is

All traders, especially beginners, must focus on a few markets and keep
grading their performance. Having too much money and chasing too
many stocks tends to lead to sloppy trading. Making money is the overall
goal of trading, but learning to trade is the essential first step. It is easier
and less stressful to learn while trading a relatively small account. A feel-

and we take them only because our rules force us to do so.

Uptrendlines connect bottoms of rallies (line A), and downtrendlines
connect tops of declines (line B). Zones that served as support on the
way down become resistance on the way up, and vice versa (line C).
The behavior of prices at the tops sometimes mirrors that at the nearby
bottoms—a false upside breakout B was followed by a false downward
breakout D. Notice that Figure 3.1 is the chart of the Mexico Index—
technical analysis knows no borders.
At the right edge, neutral to bullish. Prices are rallying from a false
downside breakout, a bullish pattern. The rally is seven days old and
approaching a downtrendline, where prices are likely to run into stiff
resistance—potentially bearish. If prices break through, the next upside
target will be at the level of the early July peak.

Price levels that serve as support on the way down become resist-

Volume spikes A, I, and J indicate that a move is nearing an end. A
decline may stop immediately, as it did in area I, or continue to slide,
as it did in areas A and J, creating bullish divergences A-B and J-K.
Areas E and F are among several examples on this chart in which
volume rises during downswings and shrinks on upswings, which is
typical bear market behavior.

The slope of an MA shows whether bulls or bears are in control. The
shorter an MA, the more “whippy” it gets. Position traders should aver-

Exponential moving averages, unlike simple ones, are not distorted by

Upturns and downturns of a moving average identify trend changes;
these are the most important messages of an MA. Buying at a rising
EMA (exponential moving average) means buying value, whereas chas-
ing rallies leads to greater fool theory trades—overpaying and hoping
that a greater fool will pay even more down the road. The letter L iden-
tifies a downtrend. Shorting in area M means shorting value, expecting
to cover below value. The kangaroo tail B serves as the first low of a
double bottom; prices try to grind down into that area but fail, and a
strong rally ensues.
At the right edge—bearish. The trend is down, identified by the EMA,
which is pushing lower. The shorting signal M is still in effect. Keep a stop

The upper channel line reflects the normal limits of market optimism,
the lower line the normal limits of market pessimism. In uptrends, the
envelope hugs rally peaks, while lows may not reach the lower channel
line; in downtrends, the lows touch an envelope, while the highs may
not reach it. The longer the timeframe, the wider the envelope; the
weekly envelope is about twice as wide as the daily in the same market.
A well-drawn envelope contains about 95% of recent market data, while
Bollinger bands expand and contract with market volatility.

The time to buy is when the trend is up, identified by a rising mov-
ing average. Buying near the rising EMA is a value trade. When prices
hit the upper channel line, they show that optimism is rampant, the
market is overbought, and it is a good time to sell and take profits.
Reverse the procedure in downtrends; when the EMA is down, short

the lower channel line.
At the right edge—bearish to neutral. The trend is down, prices have
already touched their EMA, and are headed lower. If, within the next
few days, there is a rally above 75, touching the EMA, you may get a
chance to sell short and then look to cover near the lower channel line.
If not, stand aside and continue to monitor the stock. The downtrend is
getting a little long in the tooth, and you should be alert to the flatten-
ing of the EMA; when it turns up, it will give a strong buy signal.

Prices fall to a new low A, rally, and then fall to a lower low B, where
MACD-Histogram traces a more shallow bottom. Notice a slight rally
above the centerline between the two lows, “breaking the back of the
bear.” This strong bullish message is reinforced by a tail in point B.
Prices rally to a new high C, pause, and then rise even higher at D, while
MACD-Histogram completes a bearish divergence, rising to a very
shallow top, with a fall below the centerline between the two peaks.
Divergences are the strongest signals of MACD-Histogram, but there are
many more ordinary rises and declines, confirming market moves, not

Force Index gives buy signals when it declines below zero during
uptrends. You can find other points, in addition to B and C, where the EMA
rises while Force Index becomes negative, giving a buy signal. Force Index
gives sell signals when it rises above zero during downtrends. It identified
shorting opportunities at points E, F, and G, as well as many others. The
bullish divergence in area A develops when prices try to break down to a
new low, while the lows of Force Index become more and more shallow.
The spikes of Force Index identify exhaustion moves. This chart captures a
bearish period in the life of GX, but even so, most downward spikes of
Force index lead to substantial rallies or a pause in the downtrend.
At the right edge of the chart—neutral to bearish. The trend is down,
the latest spike has interrupted the decline, and prices are likely to hold
flat for a while. Watch out for either a breaking of the low H or a bullish

When the trend, identified by the slope of the EMA, is up and Bear
Power becomes negative but then ticks upward, it gives a buy signal.
This occurred three times during the uptrend of April–May. The oppo-
site, a shorting signal, occurs when the EMA signals a downtrend, and
Bull Power rises to or above zero, but then ticks downward. Whenever
Bull Power traces a new record peak for the past several months, it iden-
tifies great power of bulls and calls for higher prices ahead. Shortly
before entering area E, Bull Power became negative for the first time
since the beginning of the rally; when it rose to a new, lower peak and
then ticked down, it completed a bearish divergence. That strong sell
signal was confirmed by a kangaroo tail; important technical signals
often confirm one another.
At the right edge of the chart—bearish. The trend, identified by the
EMA, is down, and Bear Power is becoming deeper, while bulls are
underwater. Wait for a rally to the EMA to add to shorts.

Stochastic identifies overbought conditions and gives sell signals
when it reaches its upper reference line and turns down. It identifies
oversold conditions and gives buy signals when it reaches its lower ref-
erence line and turns up. Divergences between indicators and prices
provide some of the strongest signals in technical analysis. The stock ral-
lies to a higher high at B than at A, but Stochastic turns down from a
lower peak, providing an extra powerful sell signal. This pattern recurs
in area G-H, just as the stock is knocking its head against the resistance
area above 47.50. When different technical patterns flash the same sig-
nals, they confirm one another, reinforcing each other’s message.
At the right edge of the chart—neutral. The stock has just broken
down to a new low, while Stochastic is not confirming. Wait for the
indicator to tick up with your finger on the trigger. If it ticks up from a
higher level than in area M, it will complete a bullish divergence and
give a strong buy signal. On the other hand, if Stochastic does not turn

up and create a bullish divergence, it will confirm the strength of the
downtrend—stay short.

A good trading system pulls out a few key factors from the huge mass

which is why system parameters must be tweaked with the passage of
time. Discretionary traders with a good feel for the markets focus their

trader will focus on the channel or the spikes in Force Index. Use the
method that appeals to you, but do not make your decisions “on the

In day-trading, profits are smaller and expenses are higher. There are
long periods of “dead time,” but when a signal comes, you must recog-

Day-trading demands a much higher degree of concentration than
position trading because it does not leave you time to think. Impulsivity
is deadly because you have no time to correct your mistakes. Day-
trading is an expensive proposition that generates high commissions and
leads to purchases of software, data, and other tools, that are the main
reasons why brokers and vendors love it. To succeed, you must face
your impulsivity and work to reduce it. A written trading plan is a use-

When a downward gap first appears, it is hard to tell whether it is a
continuation of the downtrend or an exhaustion move prior to an
upside reversal. The downside breakout from the opening range con-
firms the downtrend and gives the first good shorting signal of the day.
The deepening bottoms of MACD-Histogram show that the bears are
growing stronger and lead one to expect lower prices ahead. Rallies to
the EMA create shorting opportunities throughout the day. During the
last hour of trading prices dip to a new low, while MACD-Histogram
traces a higher bottom. This bullish divergence gives a buy signal—time
to take profits on shorts.
At the right edge of the chart—bearish. The trend is down, and prices
closed near the lows; expect a lower opening tomorrow. The beauty of
day-trading is that there is no overnight risk. We can wait for the open-

conditions are met. There is no harm listening to tips, as long as you put
them through the same screens as your regular stocks; perhaps they
should be added to the regular list. Trading in a room full of people is
much more likely to lead to emotional decisions. Successful traders

One of the few statistically proven market behaviors is the tendency
of prices to fluctuate above and below value. Channels help identify
manic levels for selling longs and going short and depressed levels for
covering shorts and going long. Before putting on a trade, make sure

channel contains about 95% of prices, but no channel is perfect. Some

When prices hit the upper line of a well-drawn channel, they reveal
market mania and give a sell signal. You can place your sell order in
advance, at the channel line. If you are in front of the screen during the
day, you may wait for prices to punch above that line and then exit
when prices fail to make a new high for the day or, as a fallback, when
they weaken and hit the channel wall from above. The time to cover
shorts is when prices hit the lower channel wall. Notice a beautiful buy
signal between points C and D. Prices came back to touch the EMA
before embarking on their most dynamic rally. The only way to have
caught that buy signal was to estimate tomorrow’s EMA value each day
and place a buy order there for the day ahead.

Writing covered options is an expensive proposition because of com-

writing calls in downtrends and puts in uptrends. Time works for the
writer because the options he sells lose value with each passing day.

MONEY MANAGEMENT
Answer 68
Choice 5 is correct. Give yourself four points for choosing the right answer.
A system with a positive expectation allows you to make money over
a long series of trades—it gives you an edge but not a guarantee of
success. A system may deliver more losing than winning trades but still
be profitable if winners are bigger than losers. Each individual trade is
dicey, but a well-designed system creates a positive expectation over a
long series of trades. Money management can protect a trader using
such a system, but it cannot turn a losing system into a winner.

Choice 3 is correct. Give yourself four points for choosing the right answer.
The 2% Rule, the most important rule of money management, protects
you from ever losing more than 2% of your account equity on any sin-
gle trade. If your stop is close and risk per share is small, you may trade
a bigger size, as long as you are mindful of the overnight risk. If the stop
is far and risk per share is high, the size has to be smaller because your
total dollar risk may never exceed 2% of your account equity.

B. 1 and 2. Give yourself four points for choosing the right answer, or
two points if you answered C.
According to the 2% Rule, you may not risk more than 2% of your
account equity on any given trade, including commissions and slip-
page. Having a $50,000 account allows you to risk no more than
$1,000 per trade. Trade 1: you risk $1.50 per share on 500 shares, for a
total of $750, which is acceptable. Trade 2: you risk $3 per share on 300
shares, for a total of $900, which is acceptable. Both trades leave room
for slippage and commissions. Trade 3: you risk $1 per share on 1,000
shares, for a total of $1,000, which leaves no room for slippage or com-
missions. Trade 4: you risk $6 per share on 200 shares, for a total of
$1,200, which would break the 2% limit. Trade 5: you risk $2 per share
on 700 shares, for a total of $1,400, which would break the 2% limit.

The key rule of money management is never risk more than 2% of
your account on any given trade. The dividing line is drawn at 2%—if
you risk less, it is a businessman’s risk, and if you risk more, you are

staring at a loss. Two percent of $100,000 comes to $2,000, 2% of
$20,000 to only $400—this is your maximum permitted risk per trade.
Trade 1: you risk $1.25 per share on 1,000 shares for a total of $1,250—
less than 2% of a $100,000 account (businessman’s risk). Trade 2: you
risk $2 per share on 300 shares for a total of $600—more than 2% of a
$20,000 account (risk of loss). Trade 3: you risk $1.50 per share on 200
shares for a total of $300—less than 2% of a $20,000 account (busi-
nessman’s risk). Trade 4: you risk $4 per share on 1,000 shares for a total
of $4,000—more than 2% of a $100,000 account (risk of loss). Trades
2 and 4 could still be done, only with a smaller size, pushing the risk
below 2% of each account. In trade 5, without a stop, what if that stock
slides to $5, which could happen in a bear market? Busting through the
2% risk limit can damage even the biggest account.

Bill plans to risk $4 per share on 100 shares, or $400, plus commis-
sions and slippage. The 2% Rule allows him to risk up to $500. His
trade is within the limits of the 2% Rule. Still, he is pushing it a bit. As
a beginner, he’d better stay farther away from the 2% limit. Perhaps he
could focus on lower-priced stocks and work on his analysis, entry, and
exit techniques without coming so close to the 2% limit.

Since a gold futures contract has 100 ounces, a trader wins or loses
$100 whenever gold rises or falls $1 per ounce. Gary plans to risk $300,
plus commission and slippage. The 2% Rule allows him to risk a maxi-
mum of $400. The 2% Rule allows him to take that trade. Gary is aim-
ing for a $900 profit, risking $300. Those are good odds, but his plan
illustrates how hard it is to trade a small account. A mere $3 move
against him puts him near the limit of his risk tolerance. He may want
to look into trading smaller minicontracts.

Choice 3 is correct. Give yourself four points for choosing the right answer.
All of the choices given are helpful, but none compares in impor-
tance with having a boss whose main tasks are money management and
discipline. People who trade well for institutions can rarely match their
performance level once they leave to trade for themselves, because they
leave the manager behind. A private trader has to be his own manager,
which is why it is essential to write down your trading plans and rate
yourself on your adherence to them.

Record your account size at the beginning of the month. To observe the
6% Rule, you must stop trading as soon as your equity dips 6% below that
level. Stay out for the balance of the month. Your risk is at its highest when
you put on a trade; the total account risk will never exceed 6% because
then you simply may not put on another trade. Following the 2% Rule, you
may have more than three open positions, if each risks less than 2%.

The less money you risk on any given trade, the more objective you
are likely to be, and the more likely that trade is to be a winner. It is
important to trade a fairly consistent size and reduce it when losing.

132 ANSWERS AND RATING SCALES
Putting on bigger trades in an attempt to recoup losses is typical ama-
teur behavior. Professionals plan their trades for safety and survival first,
for big profits second. The best trades tend to have very tight stops,
allowing you to trade a large size with a fairly small amount at risk.
Answer 82
Choice 2 is correct. Give yourself four points for choosing the right answer.
Overtrading means risking too much for your account. Making three
trades a day can be a legitimate level of activity for a day-trader, and an
active swing trader may make 10 trades a week when the market is run-
ning. The maximum risk per trade in a $100,000 account is $2,000, and
someone who buys right above support with a very tight stop may be
able to afford to trade a big size. The maximum risk for a $100,000
account is $6,000 per month, allowing five open trades risking $1,000
each. Having 10 open positions, whose risk amounts to $7,500, busts
through the 6% Rule and indicates overtrading.

Gloating after taking a profit or cringing after taking a loss does noth-
ing to improve future performance. What did I do right? Have I made a
mistake? What should I do differently next time? A focused, disciplined
trader keeps asking himself these and other questions, and a trading
diary helps him answer them. People who have the discipline to keep
good records have the discipline to win consistently. Still, it may be
impractical for a very active trader to keep a diary of every single trade.
In that case, it is important to keep a diary for every second, third, or
fifth trade, in strict order, rather than deciding to keep it for “interesting”
trades and omitting it for “ordinary” trades. Knowing which is which
tends to come well after a trade has been closed out.

Entry—4. 75%.
Exit— 2. 25%.
Give yourself two points for each correct answer.
The entry grade rates the quality of your entry by expressing it as a
percentage of that day’s range. If the high of the day was 48, the low 44,
and you bought at 47, then your entry grade is 75, meaning you missed
75% of the day’s range. The lower the percentage while buying, the bet-
ter. The exit grade rates the quality of your exit. If the high of the day
was 54, the low 50, and you sold at 51, your exit grade is 25. It means
you captured 25% of that day’s range. The higher the percentage, the
better for the seller. The idea is to get your buying grade below 50% and

Rapidly changing prices affect people like the noise and flashing of

Having to describe a chart forces you to focus on specific signals that
led to a trading decision. Live charts often seduce traders into joining
emotional crowds; reading your orders from a printed sheet reinforces
discipline. If you planned to buy a stock if it trades flat, but it gaps up
the next morning and you have not planned for it, there is no reason to
trade. When a stock does something you have not anticipated, that is a
clear signal that your decision making was not in gear with the market,
and putting on a trade is not a good idea.

Trading requires time just as much as it requires capital. You need to

usually on weekends. All open positions have to be reviewed daily. You
need to keep a timetable of all important news that may impact your
market in order to decide whether to hold your position, reduce its size,
or get out. Breakouts from opening ranges can help with entries; weak
prices near the close can give the signal to get out of a trade. The more

group A must be reviewed in depth daily. B is the group where you
expect a trade within a few days, and its stocks or futures should be
reviewed a few days later. C is the group where you do not anticipate
a trade for a week, and its stocks or futures can be set aside for the rest

AND QUESTIONS



LET’S TRADE
The longer you trade, the more you learn—practice will make you a
better trader. Be sure to put on many small trades and carefully docu-
ment every entry and exit. Good records allow you to learn from expe-
rience. Trading small will help you keep emotions in check. You will
have plenty of time to increase your trading size once you become a
competent trader.
Remember this paragraph from Come Into My Trading Room:
Keeping good records is the single most important contribution to
your success. If you scrupulously maintain records, review them, and
learn from them, your performance will improve. If, at the same time,
your money management is in place to ensure survival during the
learning process, you’re sure to become a success.
This chapter of the Study Guide offers you an opportunity to prac-
tice making trading decisions and keeping records. Look at the charts
in this chapter as if you saw them in your trader’s diary. Mark up chart
patterns and indicator signals, and write down your comments on the
most important points. Make your trading decision and then turn to
the Answers chapter to compare your notes with mine and grade your
performance.
There are many ways to reach a trading decision. Some serious
traders use fundamental analysis, others technical, some combine both,
while gamblers trade “from the gut.” I like to be aware of the key fun-
damentals, but my favorite method is technical analysis. Price, time,
and volume reflect actions of all market participants—smart and dumb,

disciplined and gamblers, rich and poor, long-term and short-term
oriented. Prices and indicators are the footprints of bulls and bears. Let
us practice reading those footprints in order to find our way.
The charts in this section were printed in December 2001, not long
after the disaster of September 11th in New York. In stressful times like
these, when fundamentals shift rapidly, technical analysis really shines.
How to Work with These Case Studies
You will see three charts for each trade—two for the entry and one for
the exit. For the entry, you will have a weekly and a daily chart. The
weekly chart will show about a year and a half of history, a 26-week
EMA (solid), a 13-week EMA (dotted), and MACD-Histogram. The daily
chart, ending on the same day, will show several months of history,
the 22-day and the 13-day EMAs (solid and dotted), a 2-day Force Index,
and MACD-Histogram. For exit and reentry decisions, you will see an
updated daily chart that will, in addition to the above, show a trading
channel centered around the long EMA.
These charts feature some of my favorite indicators, although many
others could be used. It would impossible to show all important indi-
cators in a study guide, especially since serious traders always change
their sets of technical tools. My main goal here is to demonstrate the
need for using multiple timeframes—making a strategic decision on
the weekly chart and tactical choices on the daily chart. I also want to
illustrate the need for combining several indicators—trend-following
and oscillators—to evaluate different aspects of market behavior and
make rational trading decisions.
It is your job to find, mark, and document at least two important trad-
ing signals on each chart. You will receive a point for each correctly
marked signal and bonus points for identifying additional trading sig-
nals. Be sure to document each step that you take.
There are eight sets of charts, covering eight trades. Begin by work-
ing through an entry in one market, and then grade your performance
on that entry. Afterward, work through an exit and grade your perform-
ance again, using rating scales in the Answers section. If you are satis-
fied with your performance, move on to the next trade and repeat this
process. If you find that you have done poorly in a trade, return to Come

blers who jump into the market with both feet, chasing a quick buck—
and get taken out feet first. Education, record keeping, and caution are
essential for your long-term success, which is the only success worth
having in the financial markets.
Please do not try to complete all eight exercises in a single day. Give
yourself enough time to think, reflect, reread relevant chapters, and
review other charts on your screen. You can take more than a week to
work through these exercises.
Here is the recommended sequence of steps as you move through
eight trades:
1. Look at the Entry Question page, which shows two unmarked
charts—weekly and a daily.
2. Mark two or more trading messages on each chart; make an entry
decision and document it.
3. Go to the Entry Answer page for that trade and grade your entry per-
formance. If the grade is satisfactory (above the pass point), proceed
as directed below; otherwise, return to Come Into My Trading Room
and study the relevant chapters.
4. Go to the Exit Question page, which shows an updated unmarked
daily chart. Quickly cover it with a sheet of paper.
5. Gently move the sheet from left to right, until you uncover the ver-
tical arrow marking the entry into the trade; from that day onward,
move the sheet to the right very slowly, one day at a time, stopping
after you uncover each day.
6. Whenever you see an exit point, based on chart or indicator signals,
mark it; whenever you see a likely reentry point, mark it also. Most
charts have more than one exit and reentry point.
7. Once you reach the right edge of the chart, go to the Exit Answer
page and rate your performance. If the grade is satisfactory (above
the pass point), proceed as directed below; otherwise, return to
Come Into My Trading Room and study the relevant chapters.
8. Proceed to the next trade and repeat the process.

146 CASE STUDIES
Technical analysis is partly a science and partly an art—partly objec-
tive and partly subjective. There are two main approaches to using it in
trading—systematic and discretionary. Systematic traders test and auto-
mate every step. Discretionary traders change their tools as markets
evolve. If you are a systematic trader, you will test all the tools and
apply them in an absolutely uniform manner. As a discretionary trader,
I adjust my tools and every once in a while try to anticipate indicator
signals. The trick is to anticipate them ever so slightly, without going too
far out on a limb, and use the protection of money management.
Intelligent traders may disagree about trading signals. This is why a
professional trader is unlikely to get a perfect score on these tests. He
will bring his personality into the picture and interpret markets slightly
differently. Show me an experienced trader with independent judg-
ment, good records, and solid money management, and I will show
you a winner. What if you see some charts in a different light than I do?
I fear an avalanche of e-mails with questions, and not enough hours

argue about trades late into the night is in Traders’ Camps. Bring in your

You do not get paid for entering trades, you get paid for exiting them.
Beginners spend most of their time looking for trades, but give little
thought to how they will exit. It is a fact that most trades are profitable

Putting on a trade is like jumping into a fast-moving river. You have
more control over an entry than over an exit. You can wait to jump in
until you see a perfect or near-perfect point. Getting out is much harder
because of the fast current and rocky shores. When you wait for an
entry, your only risk is a missed opportunity, but there are many oppor-
tunities in the markets. Exits are much more demanding—you want to
allow a stock to move in your favor to its full potential, but you do not
want to risk losing your paper profits.

Chart A1-a
When the bull market in technology stocks ended in 2000, it gave way
to a vicious bear market. Many weak companies were delisted and went
bankrupt, but the decline also swept down shares of many well-run com-
panies. Oracle is one of America’s great technological corporations, not
some silly dot-com. Still, its shares were taken down from a high of 46
in 2000 to a low of 10 in 2001, a nearly 80% decline.
In early October 2001, weekly MACD-Histogram ticked up from a
higher bottom, completing a bullish divergence against a much lower
bottom in May, while prices traced a lower bottom. The fast 13-week
EMA turned flat. Even though the longer-term 26-week EMA continued
to decline, a bullish divergence of MACD-Histogram allowed us to
override the signal of the EMA.
The daily chart sports two bullish divergences. MACD-Histogram
keeps tracing more and more shallow bottoms, which show that bears
are becoming weaker even as prices grind lower. The more shallow bot-
toms of Force Index confirm that bears are running out of steam.

ORCL wasted little time before rallying above its moving averages. The
failure of the rally to reach the upper channel line lets you know that
the upmove is not likely to be very strong. The channel has been drawn
to contain the data during the decline in September. Back then, declines
used to punch the lower channel line. Now, the failure of prices to
reach the upper channel line shows that the rally is weak and profits
should be taken quickly instead of waiting for more, which you would
do in a powerful rally.
At point A, Force Index has completed a triple bearish divergence—
three lower tops during three uplegs of a rally. Prices still cannot reach
the upper channel line, making this a good spot to take profits and
employ your cash and attention elsewhere. The divergence deepens
at point B and gives a final ring at point C, after Force Index rises
above its centerline following the first nasty spill since the beginning of
the rally.
Overstaying a long trade in area C would have meant sitting through
an unpleasant decline below the EMA. That decline D actually creates

another buying opportunity, followed by a bearish divergence of
MACD-Histogram in area E—a lower indicator peak during a higher
price peak.
A trader who oversleeps exit E gets one last chance in area F, where

This is another “fallen angel”—a high flier blown out of the sky by the
bear market in high-tech stocks. Many poor souls were desperate enough
to buy SUNW at 65, but few buyers came when SUNW hit its 7.50 low.
The average height of a bar reflects the level of trading activity. The bars
were much taller above 60 than below 10, reflecting greater public
interest in this stock near the top than near the bottom.
At the right edge of the weekly chart, MACD-Histogram has com-
pleted a bullish divergence A by ticking up from a much more shallow
bottom in 2001 than it reached in 2000, even though prices are much
lower. Moreover, there is a rarely seen bullish divergence B of MACD-
lines between the April and September bottoms. In area C, prices are
undervalued, below the EMA, and the latest bar of MACD-Histogram,
while pointing down, is shorter than the previous bar. This uptick com-
pletes a bullish divergence, telling us to look for an entry into a long
trade on the daily charts.

As a rule, it pays to bracket the long moving average with an envelope
or a channel and use its walls as guidelines for taking profits. One of the
few proven behaviors of the market is its tendency to oscillate above
and below value. If we buy near the moving average, near value, then
our goal is to sell when the stock or commodity becomes overvalued,
near the upper channel line.
The first selling opportunity in SUNW comes in area A, after the stock
spends more than a week going nowhere, straddling its moving average.
Do we want to give the trade more time to work out, or close it and look
for another? If you trade a small account, it is important to free up your
capital. Even in a larger account, a stock that is going nowhere ties up
more than capital. It competes for the trader’s attention, taking his mind
off other, more promising, trades, almost like a sick child tends to get
the lion’s share of attention in the family.
If we continue to hold, SUNW presents a fantastic selling opportu-
nity in area B. Prices speed up to the upside, puncture the upper chan-
nel line with an unusually tall bar, only to weaken near the close and
end the day within the channel. Our goal is to sell above value, and this

stab above the upper channel line shows that the market is overvalued
but cannot hold that level. MACD-Histogram ticks down the next day,
confirming that bulls are running out of breath.
A quick stab into the area between the two EMAs around Thanks-
giving, in area C, creates a buying opportunity since the weekly chart
still is in an uptrend. In area D, SUNW rises to a double top, while
MACD-Histogram traces a bearish divergence and gives a strong sell
signal. Prices fail to reach their upper channel line, while MACD-
Histogram diverges and even MACD-lines start to diverge. There is no
point in sticking around any longer; it is high time to take your winnings
off the table and switch your attention to another stock.

This trade illustrates the importance of fundamental analysis and the
value of personal networking. Shortly after the September 11 disaster, a
group of campers gathered for our regular monthly meeting in my
Manhattan apartment. We agreed that the investment/trading theme
for the next several months was likely to be security and I asked one of
our campers to come up with a complete list of all security-related
firms. I reviewed each of them, using the Triple Screen system. KROL
appeared to be the most attractive stock on the list, and I e-mailed my
analysis to everyone who was at our meeting.
Kroll, Inc. is an international corporate security firm. Its stock traded
above 41 in 1999 before sliding below 5 in 2000 when it made a few
unwise acquisitions. In 2001 it appeared completely sold out and list-
less, with narrow weekly ranges. MACD-Histogram and MACD-lines
have traced bullish divergences A and B, while prices have traced a
rounded bottom, known as a “saucer bottom” C, with a breakout at D.
The daily chart shows an upside gap immediately after the resumption
of trading in September, followed by a brief pullback. The huge peak of
Force Index, which makes its entire previous history appear as a flat line,
shows a tremendous bullish force and calls for higher prices ahead. Both

The first selling opportunity in KROL comes in the area A, where the
stock penetrates its channel, while Force Index traces a bearish diver-
gence. There is a great reentry opportunity in area B, when KROL
returns to its fast EMA. We need to calculate this EMA daily, estimate its
value for tomorrow, and put our buy order in that area.
The rally in area C offers us a choice—take profits above the enve-
lope or continue to hold because peak C of Force Index is even higher
than peak A. When bulls grow stronger as prices rise, they tell us that
higher prices are likely ahead.
The pullback to the EMA in area D presents another good opportu-
nity to reestablish long positions or to add to existing ones. The rally in
area E creates the best exit opportunity for longs—bearish divergence
C-E of Force Index shows that bulls are running out of steam, while the
failure of prices to reach their upper channel line confirms this message.
MACD-Histogram also traces a bearish divergence, in tandem with

IMCL: A Steady Trend Against a Pervasive Enemy
A
Chart A4-a
A key principle of the Triple Screen trading system is to make strategic
decisions on long-term charts, and then turn to short-term charts for tac-
tical decisions about entries and exits. The weekly chart of IMCL shows
a series of slow and steady swings, each lasting several months. If we
can get in gear with an upswing, we should trade from the long side as
long as it continues. If we get in gear with a downswing, we can con-
tinue shorting for as long as that downmove stays in force.
At the right edge of the weekly chart, in area A, both weekly EMAs
have turned up, giving buy signals. At the same time, MACD-Histogram
has ticked up, reinforcing the bullish message (this is an Impulse System
buy—both the EMA and MACD-Histogram point higher).
IMCL has been stuck in a flat trading range for the past two months.
The bottoms of MACD-Histogram have become shallow, showing that
bears are becoming weaker. Bulls, at the same time, have maintained
their strength—the rallies of MACD-Histogram above its centerline have
been rising to the same level during those two months. As prices push
higher, toward overhead resistance near the right edge, Force Index

IMCL offers a profit-taking opportunity at point A, just two days after the
entry. Prices blow outside of their channel, marking an overbought con-
dition, a selling opportunity. A decline that follows takes IMCL down
into the “sweet zone”—the value area between the fast and the slow
EMAs.
There is a window in September—a blank spot following the sus-
pension of trading after the terrorist acts of September 11. Most stocks
sank after the markets reopened, but not IMCL. Two days later Force
Index rallies to a fantastic peak, indicating a great buildup of buying
pressure. When a stock bucks the trend of the market, it sends a strong
message that it really wants to go its way, no matter what.
There is a decision to be made in area C—to take profits above the
envelope or to continue to hold. The great height of peak C of Force
Index indicates that higher prices are likely ahead because bulls grow
stronger as prices rise.
If you sell, IMCL provides a new buying opportunity in area D, where
it declines below its fast EMA, and an even better opportunity in area E.
The volatility decreases, and prices stay for a few days in that value
zone between the two EMAs, before embarking on a new rally.

ANSWERS 179
That rally, and the following one, starting from the bottom F, are
decidedly anemic affairs. IMCL is still trending higher, but losing its old
vigor. When the rally H approaches the upper channel line, it offers
a chance to take profits. There is one final good exit, in area I, where a

Commodities are the essential building blocks of the economy. Nobody

if AMZN disappears, somebody else will sell books and we’ll find some-
thing else to trade. On the other hand, we could not live our normal
lives without wheat, cotton, sugar, or other commodities.
Since commodity contracts expire every few months, we need to use
perpetual or continuous contracts to analyze long-term weekly charts.
Those are mathematical constructs that combine the nearby actual
contracts in a seamless transition. We use real contracts to study the
daily charts.
At the right edge of the weekly chart, wheat appears to be at the tail
end of a multiyear bear market—it is the cheapest it has been in more

Its daily ranges are narrow and prices do not outrun the EMAs very far.
Slow rallies tend to persist longer than wild affairs. Still, it would be
tempting to take profits in area A, after wheat manages to put some air
between itself and its moving averages.
Area B offers a good opportunity to reestablish longs or to add to the
existing ones when wheat pokes into the value zone between the two
EMAs. A conscientious trader calculates his EMAs daily, projects them
one day ahead, and places his entry orders accordingly.
After touching its EMAs in area B, wheat explodes into area C, where
it offers a perfect profit-taking opportunity. Prices blow out of their
channel into overvalued territory, accompanied by a bearish divergence
of Force Index, which shows that prices are rising only out of inertia,
as bulls have less force.
Prices sink back to their EMAs in area D, tempting traders to re-
position long; only instead of rallying they continue to sink, hitting stops.
In area E both EMAs turn down, canceling the buy signal altogether.
This is the end of the bullish campaign in wheat for the time being.

ANSWERS 183
Nobody can know the future with certainty. All we can do is play the
probabilities, buy at the rising EMA, and take profits in the vicinity of
the upper channel line, all the while protecting our positions with stops.
We may move stops only in the direction of the trade, never against it.

Chart A6-a
We can apply technical analysis to markets in all countries because of the
essential similarity of human beings. The veneer of civilization gives us
different appearances, but underneath we are all wired the same way.
When people feel stressed, their behavior patterns are remarkably similar
across cultural divides. Technical analysis picks up the behavior of peo-
ple under stress. If you had not known that VIP was a Russian stock, you
would have analyzed it in the same way as any other stock on your list.
VIP had its IPO in the high 20’s and then twice stabbed at the 60 level
before sinking in the 2000–2001 bear market. Once it slid below 20,
several technical patterns began to emerge, which eventually coalesced
into a trading signal at the right edge of the chart.
MACD-Histogram has traced a long-term bullish divergence A, fol-
lowed by a bullish divergence B of MACD-lines. Prices have traced a
“saucer bottom” that held all the declines, and a flat top that knocked
back rallies. Finally, at point D, prices broke through that resistance.
EMAs, MACD-Histogram, and MACD-lines turned higher at that point.
At the right edge of the daily chart, VIP has broken above its August
peak and is holding that level, refusing to decline. The breakout was

confirmed by peak A in Force Index whose highest reading in several
months called for higher prices ahead. Can we call the pattern of
MACD-Histogram a bearish divergence? No, because it never declined
below the centerline between the two peaks—it is merely a broad, pow-
erful top. At point B both EMAs are rising, confirming the power of bulls.

VIP starts rising slowly, retreating to its EMA and giving traders a chance
to get long near value. It gathers steam and hits its upper channel line
in area A, where Force Index rises to a new multimonth high. That is a
sign of the great force of bulls, pointing to the likelihood of higher
prices ahead. That peak makes it very tempting to hold through what-
ever decline may lay ahead. Still, there is no harm in selling and look-
ing to reposition long when the stock sinks back near value in the area
of its fast EMA.
In area B, VIP declines into “the sweet zone” between the two EMAs;
its daily ranges shrink, as lower prices do not attract traders’ attention.
Prices pop up in area C, then retreat without reaching the upper chan-
nel line. The next rally, in area D, provides a superb selling opportunity.
Prices reach the upper channel line, an overvalued area. At the same
time, Force Index, which had been calling for higher and higher prices,
traces a bearish divergence C-D. It shows that bulls are running out of
steam, and the rally is close to its top.
Prices stab below the slow EMA and offer another buying oppor-
tunity in area E before embarking on a new upleg of rally. One of the

ANSWERS 187
key differences between professionals and amateurs is that the pros
recognize signals early, while they are still a bit fuzzy and indistinct. An
amateur keeps waiting for clear and certain signals. By the time those
emerge, a trade is ripe for a reversal.
There are two main types of risk—money risk and information risk.
An amateur is quick to accept money risks as he enters well-established
trends where stops are far away, but the trend is pretty clear and the
information risk is low. Professionals, on the other hand, are much more
at ease with the information risk, acting in the atmosphere of uncer-
tainty, as long as their money risks are low.

IBM—Steady Green from Big Blue
A
Chart A7-a
Even a quick glance at this chart reveals that IBM has spent the past
several years in a broad trading range. Whenever it declines below
90, it is time to look for a bottom, and whenever it rallies towards 120,
it is time to look for a top.
At the right edge of the chart, in area A, IBM has recoiled from sup-
port and is headed higher. This rally is confirmed by the uptick of
weekly MACD-Histogram. Note that there is no bullish divergence,
simply an upside reversal of prices and the indicator. The fast EMA has
already turned up, confirming the rally and giving an Impulse buy sig-
nal, while the slower EMA has gone flat, a normal behavior at an early
stage of a rally.
The daily chart of IBM shows increased volatility following the
September interruption of trading on the NYSE. By the end of that
month, Force Index traces a bullish divergence A—a more shallow
bottom of the indicator during a deeper price bottom. The new high of
Force Index in area B calls for higher prices ahead; this message is con-
firmed by the uptrend of MACD in area C. The uptrend is further

IBM is a typical blue chip, moving slowly and steadily, with none of the
wild gyrations seen in so many “cats and dogs.” The slope of the slow
22-day EMA tracks the trend, while the faster 13-day EMA identifies value
levels for entries.
At point A, IBM rises near its upper channel line, offering the first of
many selling opportunities. Two days later it backs down, touching the
fast EMA. This pullback to value provides an excellent opportunity to
hop aboard if you missed the first buy signal. Professional traders who
have plenty of experience carrying large positions often use such pull-
backs for pyramiding. They keep adding to their original positions,
building them to a larger size, until they get an extra-strong exit signal,
at which point they sell the whole lot.
The rally in area C provides another opportunity to take profits, as
prices touch their upper channel line, an overvalued area. That rally is
followed by a decline back to the EMA in area D, offering yet another
opportunity to go long. This is the beauty of trading swings in blue
chips. All you need to do is find a few stocks that exhibit regular swings,
fine-tune your EMAs and channels, and start buying value and selling
overvalued levels or shorting value and covering undervalued levels.

ANSWERS 191
IBM rises into area E but fails to reach its upper channel line, a sign
of lessening bullish power. If you miss this signal to sell, IBM rings a
loud bell a few days later in area F. Another rally fails to reach the upper
channel line, signifying weakness. At the same time, Force Index traces
a bearish divergence E-F, calling for more weakness ahead. This is the
type of strong sell signal that professionals await before banging out of
their entire positions.
IBM offers yet another opportunity to get long, in area G, near the
EMA, but it is very questionable whether we should take that signal.
The trend is still rising, but going long so soon after a bearish divergence
is seldom a good idea because more weakness can be expected. From
that point onward, IBM goes flat, tying up a trader’s capital and, more
perniciously, his attention, which could be more profitably invested in
other stocks.

Trade 8: Biovail Corporation BVF—Entry Answer
BVF—Bull Market Punctuated by Sharp Breaks
A
Chart A8-a
This chart shows a private bull market in BVF. The stock is moving from
the lower left to the upper right corner of the chart while most other
stocks are in the midst of a broad bear market. This uptrend is occa-
sionally penetrated by sharp downdrafts, which do enough damage in
a few weeks to wipe out the gains of several months.
To a beginner who comes late to the bullish party, each of those
downdrafts can spell disaster. A pro, familiar with the past, is more
likely to view those declines as buying opportunities. He is also likely
to be extra careful with stops, protecting himself from sudden down-
moves.
At the right edge of the chart, in area A, BVF has recovered from its
post-September 11 dip. It has cleaned out weak bulls and is ready to
resume its uptrend. The upmove is confirmed by an uptick of weekly
MACD-Histogram, and an upturn of both weekly EMAs.
The daily chart of BVF shows increased downward volatility after the
September 11 trading halt. The stock takes out its July low, but there is
no follow-through to that breakout, which is a bullish sign. Within a

week, an even stronger bullish sign appears—a positive divergence of
Force Index. It makes a more shallow second low, even as prices con-

bullish sign.

BVF shoots out of the gate in September and runs until it reaches the
upper channel line, the profit-taking area, while Force Index traces a
bearish divergence in area A. Notice a less distinct divergence a few
days earlier. When a beginning trader faces such a pattern, he is better
off taking profits early, while a more experienced trader may elect to
hold. An important early step in a trader’s development is learning to take
profits without kicking himself for having left some money on the table.
Learning to hold for a maximum gain is a skill that is best learned later.
Biovail sinks below its slow EMA in area B, offering an opportunity
to get long below value. The stock rallies again in area C, and even
though that rally never reaches the upper channel line, an extremely
high peak of Force Index reveals the power of bulls and calls for higher
prices ahead. If you took profits in area C, fine; if you decided to hold,
even better, because such extreme peaks of Force Index show that bulls
are very strong and higher prices are likely ahead.
BVF sinks below its EMAs in area D—notice its repetitive behavior in
penetrating the EMA. Once you recognize such a pattern, put your buy

ANSWERS 195
order as many points below the EMA as the average depth of past
penetrations.
Biovail rallies again in areas E, F, and G. None of those rallies reach
the upper channel line, reflecting the weakness of bulls. At the same
time, Force Index starts tracing lower and lower peaks. Those bearish
divergences indicate that the top is near. Look back at the record peak
of Force Index in area C—it reflected great power of the bulls and called
for higher rallies ahead. That forecast has now been fulfilled, and in
areas F and G Force Index is giving an opposite message—that the top
is at hand. Good technical indicators work like headlights on a car.
They do not show you the entire way home, but light up enough of the
distance ahead so that if you travel at a reasonable speed, you can
anticipate the next turn in the road.

THE ROAD AHEAD
Y
ou can learn to trade. To begin, you need some basic skills—dis-
cipline, risk tolerance, and facility with numbers. You need knowl-
edge, which can be acquired through dedicated study. By working
through the Study Guide you have proven that you have what it takes
to grow into a successful trader.
Now is the time to put your time and energy into setting up
your trading operation. Design a record-keeping system, establish
money management rules, and write your trading plan. This calls
for a lot of work, but many of us find trading a fantastically inter-
esting challenge. The rewards, if you do it right, are nothing to sneeze
at either.
I enjoyed creating these exercises. People who came to my Traders’
Camps were the first to learn my methods, take the tests, and comment
on them. I also want to thank two people who put their own projects
aside to help me prepare this book. Fred Schutzman, a technical analyst
and money manager in New York, is an old and loyal friend who took
every test in this book, graded his performance, and then pointed out
several questions and answers that had to be rephrased, rearranged, or
clarified. When it comes to analysis and trading, no imperfection can
slip by Fred! My oldest daughter Miriam, a journalist and a graduate
student in Paris, went through my English with a red pen. English is my
third language, and the little girl, who is actually no longer so little,
is now fixing the English for the guy who used to read The Little Engine
That Could to her at bedtime.
You have worked through this book, but closing it does not mean
having to say good-bye. If I continue to run my Traders’ Camps, you
197

may come to spend a week during which we’ll study and work on
trading together. I look forward to hearing about your findings and
concepts as much as sharing mine with you. I now return to my trad-
ing room and wish you success in yours.
