Preface
Are you interested in trading, but don’t like to wait weeks and months for a
return? Are you following news events and want to financially benefit from
your knowledge? Are you new to trading and want to participate but avoid
the long learning curve for mastering trading skills? If these questions are on
your mind, this book is for you.
Binary option trading provides excitement and opportunity for achieving
unusually large returns in less than a week! While there are many variations
to this type of trading, this book focuses on the regulatory-approved weekly
binary option trades of the North American Derivative Exchange (Nadex).
Trades have limited risk to the cost of a position. There is no margin. The
trade is a bet on the direction of a market by the end of the week. If the trade
is correct, the payoff is $100 per lot. If it is wrong, the payoff is $0. Simply
put, it’s a yes-or-no proposition. One can open an account with as little as
$100 and start trading. This simple structure allows anyone to trade in over
20 different underlying markets, from currencies to indexes to commodities.
This book takes the reader through the basic features of the binary option
instrument. But it does more. It provides a detailed review of fundamental
and technical analysis useful to making trading decisions. Beginners, as well
as more experienced traders, will be able to build upon their core trading
knowledge. More importantly, new online tools and techniques for detecting
market sentiment are presented, because trading can no longer be separated
from the Internet and the social media it has generated. The web itself is a
force on trading decisions and outcomes, as emotions are propagated through
the web. This phenomenon has made sentiment analysis a major challenge for
traders. For the binary option trader who is shaping a decision for a weekly
outcome, or even an intraday outcome, the critical factor will be the action-
able knowledge that is applied.
This book provides real-world examples of how to scan the politi-
cal and economic news and formulate appropriate binary option trad-
ing strategies. Key trading strategies are reviewed with examples. These

include: at-the-money; out-of-the-money; in-the-money; deep-in-the-money;
and deep-out-of-the-money. Also reviewed are case studies of binary option
trading in relationship to key news events that we have lived through.
These include: The U.S. congressional elections; the Greek sovereign risk
crises; turmoil in the Middle East; and the Japanese earthquake. The reader
will see exactly how these events shaped trading strategies that worked.
This book is also designed to provide a self-directed performance audit
capability to the trader. Specific training challenges are provided, including a
test of your knowledge (see Appendix A).
No other book provides a comprehensive get-started approach to trad-
ing binary options. It is my hope that Trading Binary Options: Strategies and
Tactics makes a difference and improves your ability to get started in binary
option trading, but most importantly, to do it the right way!

Trading Binary Options: Strategies and Tactics, Second Edition
By Abe Cofnas
Copyright © 2016 by Abe Cofnas
Chapter 1
Key Features of Binary
Option Types
This chapter covers the key features of a binary option contract available
globally and in the United States. There are two basic types of binary option
trades. The first is the laddered binary options offered at the Nadex Exchange,
part of the IG Markets, the Cantor Exchange, the CBOE, the CBOT, and the
NYSE binaries, also known as Byrds. The NYSE binaries launched in 2016
and offer binaries on equities. The NYSE entry into binaries allows traders
to trade weekly binaries on major equities. The CBOE offers binaries on the
VIX and announced binaries on the China A50 index. These are potential
game changers for traders who look to use binaries as part of their total trad-
ing toolbox.
Nadex and the Cantor Exchange are CFTC approved. Nadex is owned
by IG Markets. The Cantor Exchange, owned by Cantor Fitzgerald, is a
true exchange and does not make a market in the binaries. In other words,
they don’t take the other side of a trade placed by a customer. Instead,
liquidity is supplied by independent market makers. The second type of
binary option trades is the non-laddered platform, simply offering the
opportunity to bet on the whether the price will be higher or lower at
expiration. These are not currently allowed in the United States, but are
popular around the world.
Later in the chapter, I also discuss the four basic strategies of trading—
at-the-money, in-the-money, out-of-the-money, and deep-in/out-the-money—
as well as the role of the market maker in the process. The chapter will end
with a sample bid/ask scenario.

8 Trading Binary Options
Defining the Key Features
Let’s start by defining the features that shape most of the laddered binary
option selection and trading. These terms will be used time and again
throughout this book, so commit these definitions to memory. You’ll come
to know them well.
Expiration date: The time that the option expires.
Settlement value: The value of the option on expiration. It will be $0 or
a $100-fixed payout.
Underlying market price: This is the actual real-time market price of the
underlying contract.
Contract: This is the basic unit of a trade of one lot. The value of a lot
varies among firms. For example, one lot at Cantor is $1. One lot at
Nadex is $100. At IG, 0.01 lots is $100.
Bid: The premium price that a trader receives for opening to sell a contract.
Buy: This refers to betting the underlying market will go up. A trader opens
a trade and pays the ask price associated with a strike price. If the price
settles above the strike price, then the trader wins the $100 ask price.
Sell: This refers to betting the underlying market will go down. A trader
puts on an open sell order. The trader pays for an open sell order
($100 – bid). It is $100 – (bid). This is equal to putting on a position,
anticipating a decrease in the price of the underlying market. It is also
the premium price that a trade pays for closing a position that was
bought. The sell is also labeled as the put tab at the Cantor Exchange
Spread: The difference between the bid and the ask. With any new
market, the spread will tend to be narrow as more volume increases.
Bid size/offer size: This is the number of positions being bought or sold.
You will find that the bid and offer size is not useful as an indicator
of sentiment.
Commission fee: The trader may pay a commission fee per transaction.
Nadex charges $1 per transaction. Firms offering Nadex binaries
may be offering different commissions.
Start time: At the Nadex, IG markets, and Cantor Exchanges, the start
time for a binary trader is fixed at the beginning of an interval. A
five-minute trade interval starts, for example, at 05:00 and ends at
05:05. A trader can enter the trade before the expiration, but the
time to expiration is not triggered by the entry. In other platforms
(discussed later), a rolling start is featured. This means whenever the
trader puts on a trade, the trade duration clock starts at that point
and ends at the designated duration.



==================================================
                     PAGE 13                      
==================================================

Key Features of Binary Option Types 9
Settlement value: This is the price the binary firm uses to determine
whether the trade is a winner or loser. Notice that there is no
agreement between different firms on what is the settlement value.
There are different formulas among different firms for determining
settlement value. Of particular importance is that settlement
value of binary option underlying markets among offshore firms
(not regulated in United States, London, or Australia) are often
manipulated to reduce winners.
Expiration duration: Binary expirations refer to the duration of the
option. Among global platforms, durations run the board from
one-minute to one-week expirations.
Note: The principles of trading binaries apply to all time frames. The short
time frames involve more timing skills, and require a focus on momentum
indicators and pattern breaks. Longer time frames, such as one day and more,
allow fundamentals to influence the price patterns.
Notice that missing here are the option features known as the Greeks—
Delta, Theta, Vega, Volga, and so on. They are not really missing. It’s just that
they are not necessary to trading weekly or intraday binary options that offer
fixed payouts.
Strike Price versus Underlying Market Price
Binary options featuring a laddered approach have several features that need
to be thoroughly understood. Some of these features will be familiar to option
traders and are common to all options.
The first feature to understand is the strike price. This is the price target
a trader anticipates the price will hit at expiration time: at the target, above
the target, or below the target. It is important to note that there can be up to
14 strike prices listed by the Nadex Exchange for each underlying contract.
When you have a set of strike prices to trade, they are called a ladder.
For example, at Nadex and IG, the weekly binary option ladders are
statements in which the trader decides to buy the binary option if he agrees
it will be greater than the associated strike price. If the trader believes the
settlement will be lower than the associated strike price, the trade that is put
on is a sell. See Table 1.1 for examples of binary option ladders. Notice that
the strike price closest to the indicative price (which is the market price of the
underlying contract) has an ask value near 50. It is always the case that the
market price closest to the ask price will be valued near 50.

Gold (Feb16) > 1034.5 18-Dec-15 86.00 94.25 1066.7
Another component to understand is the underlying market. The binary
option specifically tracks a particular market known as the underlying market.
The underlying market for index-related binary strike prices are, except for
the currency pairs, the near-term futures contracts. For example, a trader
wanting to put on a position on gold would be watching not only the gold
spot market, but the gold futures contract that is trading on the Commodity
Exchange, Inc. (Comex). Similarly, if a trader wants to trade the S&P 500
binary at Nadex, the actual underlying market is the active future contract.
The fact that the underlying markets may be a futures contract on the mar-
kets does not pose difficulties. The fact is that the spot and near-term futures
contract for these markets move in close tandem to each other. But the exact
settlement price is in the futures contract and not the underlying spot market,
except for the currencies.
The updated list of what markets can be traded at these exchanges can be
easily tracked at their respective websites (Table 1.2).

==================================================

Key Features of Binary Option Types 11
Currency Pairs as an Underlying Market
At Nadex IG and the Cantor Exchange, binary options are available on the
majors and many cross pairs. USD/JPY, USD/CAD, USD/CHF, EUR/USD,
GBP/USD, EUR/JPY, GBP/JPY, AUD/JPY, and the AUD/USD. This is a
broad enough range of currency pairs to enable the trader to play almost any
strategy and correlate that strategy with global market events. The underlying
market to track for trading weekly binary currency options is the spot cur-
rency market (see Tables 1.2 and 1.3).
Beginning binary traders should consider the weekly expirations. Trading
goes from Monday morning at approximately 3 a.m. EST to 3 p.m. EST on
Friday. The weekly expirations give the trader time to be right, and time for
fundamentals to work on markets. In recent years, Nadex and IG have added
20-minute and 5-minute expirations to their binary option platforms. All
the features of the longer daily and weekly durations are present in the short
expiration binaries.
Moneyness
One of the most salient relationships to thoroughly understand is where the
binary strike price is in relationship to the underlying market. This feature is
known in the field of option trading as moneyness. Understanding moneyness
of the binary option contract generates the ability to gauge market sentiment
and, along with it, the expected probability of success of a particular binary
option. There are three key metrics to evaluate.
• At-the-money (ATM): When the strike price is equal to the underlying mar-
ket price (the spot). For non-laddered binaries, putting a high-low trade on
is in effect an at-the-money trade!
• In-the-money (ITM): When the underlying market is greater than the strike
price. This occurs when a trader is buying the position. When the trader is
opening a position to sell, the option is in-the-money when the underlying
market is less than the strike price.
• Out-of-the-money (OTM): This occurs when a trader is opening the posi-
tion to buy and when the underlying market is less than the strike price
and the strike price is above the spot market price. This also occurs when
a trader is opening a position to sell and the underlying market is greater
than the strike price.



==================================================
                     PAGE 16                      
==================================================

12 Trading Binary Options
We can add two more important variations of the binary option strike
price condition: deep-out-of-the-money and deep-in-the-money. These refer to
the outer strike prices or ladders. A good way to think about where they
are located from a price point of view is to define deepness in regard to the
spot price as a 10 percent probability for out-of-the-money and a 90 percent
probability for in-the-money. Few traders would argue that those levels are
not deep.
The condition of being near-the-money is also a credible way of char-
acterizing the relationship between the binary option strike price and its
moneyness.
When the binary strike price is roughly at-the-money, the cost of
buying that strike price will be close to $50 per unit because the market
interprets an ATM strike price as having an equal probability of going up
or down. This means that a scan of actual binary strike price ask prices
that are near $50 can, in fact, serve as quick guide to where the underly-
ing spot market is at, without even looking at a chart. It’s a good idea
to routinely check ATM prices and see the relationship it has with the
underlying market.
Moneyness and Trader Direction
When a binary option strike price is in-the-money (ITM), its meaning, as
to its profitability, depends on whether the trader has gone long or short.
For example, if the trader is putting on a long position, he is expecting the
underlying spot market to go up (Table 1.3). In-the-money means that
the spot underlying market has already moved above the binary option
strike price—the underlying market is greater than the strike price. This
is exactly what the trader wants to see happen for profits to be realized.
The effect is that the market begins to price higher the cost of buying that
contract. The crowd becomes optimistic for the price to remain above the
binary strike price.

Key Features of Binary Option Types 13
TaBle 1.4 Moneyness and Spot when Selling Binaries
Moneyness Relationship to Spot
In-the-money Underlying market > strike price
At-the-money Underlying market = strike price
Out-of-the-money Underlying market < strike price
When buying a binary option, remember these relationships between
moneyness and the underlying market price.
In-the-money status for the seller is different (Table 1.4). Being ITM for
sellers means they are betting that the underlying spot price is less than the
binary option strike price. The binary contract should be seen as a floor that the
spot falls through. That is what the seller wants to see happen. Therefore
the premium for that strike price increases for those who want to trade with
the downward momentum. Remember, at Nadex the premium for selling is
$100 – bid.
The trader receives the bid price and keeps it if the settlement price stays
below the strike price.
For example, if the bid price is $85 for a binary option strike price,
it means that the binary option strike price is deep-in-the-money for
buyers, but deep-out-of-the-money for sellers. The market thinks there is
an 85 percent probability of the spot price staying above the binary, but
only a 15 percent probability of the spot price falling below the binary. If
the market becomes bearish, the bid would decline. For example, the bid
may be at $85 and then bearish news causes the bid to go down to $50.
The trader betting on a fall of the spot would pay $100 – bid or $50, much
higher than the $15 before.
Generally, a trader who is bearish and looking to an ITM binary option
strike price would be looking at the bids being lower than $50. Following this
logic, a very optimistic bearish market would have a very low price for the
bid and asks. Ask prices of $10 for a binary option strike price is a very cheap
option because the market is giving a low probability to the binary option
settling in-the-money at expiration and paying $100. For traders looking at
OTM strategies, they are betting that the opinion pool represented by the
bid/ask range is wrong, and this kind of OTM trade provides a huge reward
of 10:1 for being on the side of surprise.
We can affirm an extremely interesting relationship in the bid and ask
price ranges between the bid and ask prices and market sentiment. Since
the binary options pay only, at maximum, $100 when the binary option

==================================================

14 Trading Binary Options
trade settles in-the-money, we can interpret the bid and ask prices as a senti-
ment probability. In effect, if the ask price is $80, the “crowd” is assigning an
80 percent probability that the option will work out.
If the bid price is $20, the market is, in effect, assigning an 80 percent
probability that the binary option for a seller will work out. This is the exact
inverse of the buying probability. Think about this a bit further. Binary option
bid/ask pricing becomes a trader scorecard of the battle between buyers and
sellers. It’s the best real-time measure of bullish or bearish sentiment.
The challenge for the trader becomes one of knowing when to go with the
crowd or against the crowd. Expected probabilities that the underlying market
will reach or not reach a strike price are derived from bid and ask pricing. It is
definitely predictive in value, but it is certainly only a conditional probability.
This is because markets can and do change and react to new information. Ulti-
mately, the status that is important is the value at settlement time. In the case of
binary options, we have only one of two outcomes: $100 per unit or $0 per unit.
The Role of a Market Maker
The binary option trading is not an automatic match between buyers and
sellers. There is another component to the process: the market maker. A market
maker provides the liquidity. The essential role of the market maker is in fact
to make the market. As familiarity with the binary option product increases,
more market makers will be attracted to the opportunity. But let’s get a deeper
look at how the market maker fulfills his duty. Nadex has an agreement with
Market Risk Management (MRM), which is an entity of IG Group, to price
all markets on the Nadex exchange. But there should be no doubt that Nadex
and IG are, in fact, taking the opposite position of the trader. In contrast,
Cantor, NYSE, and CBOE are true exchanges and do not take the other
side. This is a great advantage to the trader. However, the disadvantage is the
potential lack of liquidity, if market makers are few or not providing pricing
for the different binary options.
Let’s understand further the role of market making with the binary
options. John Austin, a former market maker and one of the originators of
the binary option product, describes market making from his vantage point.
He provided the following point of view:
We need to begin with the traders. One trader looks at a price and
wants to buy, while another trader looks at the same contract and
wants to sell.

For example, the market maker makes a price at 48–51.
In a perfect world, two individual traders see the price and trade
at the same time. One thinks the price is too high and goes short in
one lot at a price of 48. The other thinks the price is too low and goes
long in one lot at a price of 51. Both traders wait until expiration,
and do not trade again, and neither does anyone else.
In this perfect world, the market maker has fulfilled his duty
(that is, he has put liquidity onto the exchange and provided a trad-
able price for traders who don’t want to work an order but would
rather trade right away), but has left himself with absolutely no
exposure to the final expiration level. He has bought one lot from the
selling trader at 48 and sold one lot to the buying trader at 51, mak-
ing a three-point profit for himself, regardless of where the market
settles. This three-point profit is his reward for posting prices and
taking risk.
In the real world, individual traders rarely choose to trade in
opposite directions in identical sizes at the same time (if they did,
there would be no need for market makers). In the real world, the
market maker posts a price that may start at 48–51 before moving
smoothly to, say, 78–81 and then dropping suddenly to, say, 19–22
and so on. Buyers and sellers come along more or less at random,
buying or selling on the market maker’s price in different sizes at dif-
ferent times. When the market maker sees a whole bunch of people
buying a certain price he may tweak his price upward by a point or
two to encourage some sellers to enter the market and balance his
risk. Alternatively, a whole bunch of people selling a certain price
may cause the market maker to tweak his price downward by a point
or two to encourage some balancing buyers.
In practice, market makers are rarely able to balance their book
perfectly, and end up wearing a position until expiration. So on any
one expiration on any one contract, the market maker may make a
large loss or a large profit.
But averaged over many contracts, over the course of a year, the
effect of the market maker’s spread should be to make the average
price at which he buys from traders slightly lower than the average
price at which he sells to traders. That is his reward for providing
liquidity, and it is paid for by the fact that losing traders lose, over
the course of a year, slightly more than winning traders win (because
binary trading, like spot FX and all other derivatives trading, is a
zero-sum game).

16 Trading Binary Options
Understanding the role of market makers provides a better understanding
of the real dynamics of binary option trading and why it is possible with honed
trading skills to gain an edge in binary option trading and have winning bets.
The actual bid and ask prices are not just the expected probabilities of bear-
ish and bullish traders. It would be wrong and naive to interpret the bid and
ask prices as a simple reflection of expected probabilities. The fact is that they
also reflect adjustments the market makers make to encourage participation.
The market maker wants more volume, because, over time, he will gain a
fraction of the spread.
Market makers try to be quants and use option analytics to help determine
adjustments in the bid and ask. But market making is not pure calculation.
Matt Brief, the current market maker for IG Markets on the binaries, pro-
vided the following answer to a question on the use of some advanced analysis
in regard to binary option pricing:
Question: Do you actually consider the presence of volatility smiles in
the case of currencies, and if so, do you calculate them? Related to
this, do you look at risk reversals in your model as well?
Answer: We try to keep our vols in line with the market. On the euro,
for example, the market currently has a high implied vol on the
downside (lower strikes), but on the upside (higher strikes), the
implied vol is the same, or lower, than the ATM vol. So there is no
volatility smile on the E/$ at present. We will tend to replicate this
in our prices.
We can conclude that the actual bid and asks are not pure participant
probabilities. Nor are they simply a function of some advanced formula or
calculation engine, such as Black-Scholes, and so on. They reflect, instead,
a combination of traders as well as market maker judgments and misjudg-
ments! The fact is that market makers cannot estimate accurately the expected
value of all strike prices, particularly those at the extremes, furthest away from
the spot price. When this happens, they have to make a best guess and usu-
ally increase the ask price to protect against uncertainty. This suggests that
traders should pay closer attention to strike prices or ladders that are deep-
out-of-the-money, where there is lighter volume. In this out-of-the-money
price zone, the bid and asks are not always directly reflective of the crowd, nor
subject to the same quantitative rigor of trading prices associated with ATM
and ITM binary options.

are Premiums Fairly Priced?
Many traders will wonder whether the premiums (bid/asks) are fairly priced.
They do not want to pay more than they have to. Markets, when working
efficiently, should result in option premiums that are fairly valued. So let’s look
at a comparison of the bid and ask pricing at Nadex with an advanced option
calculator. Do we get similar premiums? If not, why are there differences? By
entering the key pricing information in the calculator supplied by Superderiv-
atives, a world-class professional derivative option calculator, the result was
different from the real-time Nadex premium pricing of the AUD/USD weekly
1.065 binary contract (Table 1.4), which shows a bid of 16 and an ask of 21.5.
In contrast to the Nadex real-time pricing, the Superderivatives engine using
the same expiration date (April 15, 2011) and binary strike price for the AUD/
USD (1.6025) showed a bid/ask range of 7.75/19.75. At that same moment,
the same binary strike price on the Nadex platform showed a bid/ask of 16/21.5.
Why might there be a difference between the Nadex pricing and the
calculations of advanced option-pricing engines such as Superderivatives or
Bloomberg? The difference between what the option calculator shows and
what is traded is attributed to volume and judgments of the market makers.
The main point here is that there is no true trade price. It is, rather, a combina-
tion of supply and demand as well as the perceptions and misperceptions of
the market maker who participates in providing liquidity.
Another example verifying mispricing in the bid and ask of Nadex is an
analysis provided by the use of Mathematica’s powerful option analysis engine.
The bid/ask prices of the EUR/USD weekly binaries for a sample moment
in time (June 28 at 9:25 a.m.) was processed using Mathematica software.
According to Michael Kelly, Mathematica trainer and consultant, the results
reported that: “Considering that the first two are overpriced, the third at
1.4375 is correctly priced and that from the fourth to the last are underpriced.”
The main conclusion is that there is significant mispricing in these binary
options. The implication for the average trader is that human judgment still
dominates the binary option pricing. The bid/ask prices are simply reflections
of error-prone opinions and the expectations of traders (see Table 1.5). The
trader has the opportunity to profit from these conditions.

Binary Option Non-laddered Trading
In contrast to Nadex, IG, Cantor, and NYSE, most binary option trading is
done in non-laddered platforms. The trading is simpler and the choice trad-
ers make is whether the underlying market will be above or below, higher or
lower at expiration time, than the price when the trader puts on the trade.
Buying a call or put is also often the names of the trading actions. The
payoff is usually around 80 percent profit. The risk is the amount put on
the trade. A key feature of these non-laddered binaries is the inability to exit a
position. Once the position is put on, one cannot close the positions. This is
in contrast to the laddered binaries. The trader of these platforms also has
risk of receiving inaccurate prices. The fact is that binary option firms offer-
ing non-laddered options do not have price transparency. The settlement
prices for binary expirations will differ among different firms.
The challenge to the trader in these non-laddered binaries is to first reach
a breakeven performance result. Traders around the world favor the very
short-term expirations such as one minute. This is because they offer nearly
instant results and satisfaction, thereby appealing to the gambling tendencies
of those traders. Longer-term expirations above 15 minutes allow the trade to
apply technical and fundamental analysis to the position and reduce or gain
an edge as a result.

Identifying Profit Return
Potential in Binary
Option Trading
There are many reasons to participate in binary option trading. First, it is
challenging. It doesn’t matter what background or profession you may have,
binary option trading levels the playing field to all who seek to master it. This
may be disappointing to some traders who have had great success in their
own fields, only to find that the market doesn’t care at all. Whether you are a
doctor, lawyer, engineer, homemaker, truck driver, pilot, soldier, and so on,
binary option trading will demand all of your skills, as well as your emotional
intelligence. It is also exciting, as it provides quick feedback on whether your
trades are right or wrong. Yet, the dominant reason is that binary option
trading offers profitable trading opportunities at frequencies and magnitudes
rarely seen in other markets. This chapter provides a review of what the profit
potential can be in the laddered binary option trading.
Expected Probabilities
We can start from a basic description of the unique property of the laddered
binary option. It is a fixed payoff of $100 per unit. This means that at any
point in time, the value of the ask price would never be more than $100.
As a result, we can derive the important outcome that is referred to as an
expected probability. The easiest way to derive at an expected probability is
19

==================================================

20 Trading Binary Options
to look at the ask price. The ask price can be seen as an approximate measure
of what the market believes is the probability of success. A $50 USD ask
price translates into an expected probability of 50 percent that the binary
will settle above the strike price associated with the binary. An $80 USD
ask price can be interpreted as an 80 percent expected probability. Whether
one is trading a weekly binary option or an intraday option, at any given
moment, the bid/ask range signals can be considered expectations of the
market. The bid and ask prices represent a kind of crowd-mind that expresses
the emotions of the market. It becomes a probability barometer measuring
market opinion. These emotions become translated into the premiums paid
for different strike prices. This aspect of the binary option market is perhaps
its most profound feature.
Whether trading the Nadex, IG, Cantor, or NYSE binaries, the trader
has a choice to follow or fade the crowd opinion. If the trader is bullish on
the market and agrees with the emotions expressed in the ladder ask prices,
he would buy a binary with an ask price of greater than 50. The larger the
ask price, the greater the opinion of the trading community is that the
price of the underlying market will be above the strike price. So, an ask
price of 80 translates into 80 percent expected probability that the price
will be above the binary strike price that is receiving the 80 ask. Conversely,
a 20 ask translates into 80 percent of the trader crowd believes that the
price will be below that associated ask price.
A good idea is to relate the expected probabilities to the degree to which
the underlying market has to move to win or lose the positions.
We can see in Table 2.1 an example of various expected probabilities
appearing, offering a range of probabilities at the start of a week. These
strike prices were taken on a Monday morning for end-of-week expirations.
A useful metric is to detect a strike price’s percentage distance from the
underlying spot market. We can see that an ask price of 81.5 converts to a
percentage distance of 1.4 percent from the underlying spot. This means the
market has to move down more than 1.4 percent from the spot. The trader
needs to decide if this is a reasonable expectation that it would not do so in
order to win.
While there is no guarantee that the expected probability will turn out to
be settling at $100, scanning the offer ask prices provides a good first approxi-
mation of market opinion. Once a scan of market expectations is done, the
next step is deciding on the direction of your binary trade. Do you want to
join the crowd or do you want to be contrarian? Do you want a high return
with a lower chance of winning versus a lower return with a high chance of

winning? A binary trade costing $20 per unit and paying off $100 results in
a 5:1 return (excluding fees).
While this is a great result for any particular trade, the ultimate test is
the profitability curve that results over time. Simple mathematics shows that
a 5:1 binary option reward/risk ratio is required to be profitable in the long
run—at least one win over every five trades. One trade, costing $20, turning
out to be a winner will result in an $80 profit. The next four trades can be
losers and the total result would be breakeven. In contrast, an $80 cost for
a binary trade indicates a market expectation of an 80 percent probability
of being a winner. One loser would result in an $80 loss, and would require
four winners in the next five trades to get to breakeven. One has to be more
than 80 percent accurate to go with a deep-in-the-money strategy, buying
$80 binary contracts. In fact, no matter what win/loss ratio a trader has, the
challenge for the trader will be to avoid having one loss risk wiping out a large
winning streak!
Winning Occurrence Analysis
Which binary option strike prices are more likely to win? Conducting an
occurrence analysis test demonstrated the attractiveness of binary option
trading as a route to profitability. During the sample week of January 10
to 14, using an algorithm search function that retrieved all offer prices, the
algorithm was instructed to find a trade that had a market probability of
80 percent for long positions, and 20 percent for short positions. Both direc-
tions had the same expected probabilities. The result was 87 trades and a 14.6
percent return for the week (see Table 2.2).

Strategy Contracts < 20
Number of trades 87
Capital committed for long positions $3,121
Capital committed for shorting positions $330
Return results 409.25
Return on weekly investment 14.66%
Even more interesting is the fact that a strategy that was buy everything
over 80 percent, resulting in a win for a $100 payout, worked very well. This
doesn’t mean that this strategy will work all the time. Markets can suddenly
shift their sentiment and have surprise reversals. Binary option traders always
using a pure strategy have to be prepared for setbacks.
In another sample test, how would a strategy focusing on deep-out-of-
the-money trading work? During the same sample period of January 10 to 14,
19 binary option strike prices were traded. Deep-out-of-the-money (less than
50 percent probability) positions were bought. If there were deep-in-the-
money positions (over 75 percent probability), they were sold. They were held
not for a whole week but only one to three days. The percentage returns had
some losses, but were offset by very large gains using the combined strategy of
deep-out-of-the-money trading (Table 2.3).
In reviewing Table 2.4, we can obtain a greater sense of the distribution
of expected probabilities that the binary options markets generate during a
week. The table presents a snapshot of the probabilities at about 10 a.m. every
morning during a sample week (May 16 to 20, 2011) for different probability
ranges. For example, on Monday, there were 30 binary option contracts with
an ask price between $10 to 20. Of these 30 contracts, only one resulted
in-the-money at the Friday expiration. In contrast, for the cohort of $45 to
55 for ask prices on Monday, there were 15 contracts. Of these, nine settled
in-the-money at expiration on Friday. That represents a 60 percent success
rate. Even more interesting is the fate of the 42 contracts that were deep-in-
the money on Monday ($75 to $90). Of these 42, all of them were winners.
This is only a one-week sample, but it is instructive regarding the poten-
tial of winning outcomes and the challenges. In this single week, the at- or
near-the-money strategies had the highest winning percentage.

A good way to look at the expected probabilities of the binary contracts
in Table 2.4 is to view them as horses in a race. Each probability range (that
is, 10–20 percent, and so on), as depicted in Table 2.6, represents an oppor-
tunity to get to the finish line of 100 percent by the end of the week. But in
this kind of horse race, the trader is the jockey, and the racetrack conditions
can change any minute. Another difference is you can switch horses in the
middle of the race!

Identifying Potential Profits in High-low Binaries
In contrast to the laddered binaries, let’s consider binary trading on platforms
that offer trade decisions that the underlying markets will be higher or lower
at expiration. They do not provide inherent expected probabilities. In effect,
these trades are at-the-money trades and have a theoretical probability of
50 percent. Traders at these binaries do not get information on the opinion
of the crowd of traders from these platforms.
The challenge for the binary option trader using non-laddered binaries
is to identify high probable trading signals. Keep in mind that binaries that
require a higher or lower trading decision is essentially a momentum direc-
tional decision. The strongest signal that is available for this kind of trading is
a break in a pattern. Therefore, choosing to enter on a break and then picking
an appropriate duration for the trade are the two key factors for successful
trading of the high-low binaries.
Each trader needs to fine-tune the combination of expirations and what
the best chart time frame to use (Table 2.5). The following combinations,
however, are a useful place to start.

Predicting the direction of the market is a key to binary option trading, but
many traders ignore that predicting where the market will not go back to is
also a high-payoff strategy. Th is strategy works well because the crowd energy
pushing a price up or down quickly needs time to rest and new information is
necessary to reverse the situation.

This chapter provides an introduction and guide to one of the recent, and
increasingly important tool for understanding fundamental forces that
relates to binary option trading. Let’s call it sentiment detection for predicting
direction. You will learn how to create and use your own sentiment detection
tools as part of conducting fundamental analysis. A review of key fundamental
economic forces and which markets they affect are also provided.
Defining Sentiment
At the heart of binary option trading is the need to anticipate the direction
the underlying market will go. To make that decision, traders cannot ignore
market sentiment. But the question arises: Just what is market sentiment? For
starters, a text-mining technical definition of sentiment is this: the orientation
(or polarity) of the opinion on the subject that deviates from the neutral state
(Yi and Niblack 2005). In other words, sentiment relating to market condi-
tions refers to whether opinion is positive or negative. So how can traders
detect it? All of us are familiar with viewing the market as if it was a biological
sentient being that has moods. Take, for instance, when the market is referred
to as nervous or optimistic—these descriptions underscore our tendency to
anthropomorphize the market. When it comes down to shaping trades, and
in particular shaping binary option trades, the trader needs new and sharper
tools to trace the shape of market sentiment. The fact is that now all trading

is, in this age of the Internet, a social web phenomenon. “Studies of contagion
share the finding that people’s feelings and behaviors are strongly affected by
their observations of others” (Olson 2006).
The Internet has had a fantastic impact on trading because it acts as a
medium propagating a wave. The wave in trading is the collective grouping
of emotions. It is similar to what computational chemistry calls crowd-minds.
According to a recent work on artificial chemistry titled Dynamics of Crowd-
Minds (Adamatzky 2005), “A crowd-mind emerges when formation of a crowd
causes fusion of individual minds into one collective mind. Members of the
crowd lose their individuality. The deindividualization leads to derationaliza-
tion: emotional, impulsive, and irrational behavior.”
The emergence of the Internet is producing new sets of tools that can be
put to effective use by the binary option trader. The new set of tools that can
be put to effective use by the trader is called text mining. Text mining is the
art and science of finding word trends in a given document. The goal is to
determine and categorize the meaning of those documents and text. Related
to text mining is sentiment analysis. Here is how a leading sentiment scientist
described the field (Xiaoxu, Huizhen, and Jingbo 2010):
With the rapid growing availability of opinion-rich resources on the
Internet such as product reviews, blogs and twitters, sentiment anal-
ysis becomes a popular research direction whose goal is to determine
public assessments on products or social issues. Polarity analysis is
one of fundamental techniques in sentiment analysis. To determine
the polarity expressed by an opinionated sentence, it is important to
first determine which words have sentiment tendency (i.e., positive
or negative), referred to as sentiment word identification. A senti-
ment word is a word that can express positive or negative feelings of
the opinion holder.
Text mining is quickly becoming a key part of our lives. In fact, almost
everyone has experienced text mining—simply by using an Internet search
engine. With advances in programming and technology, text mining will
generate an entire new set of tools for detecting sentiment and it will revo-
lutionize technical analysis. At its most basic, the search engine scans docu-
ments, web pages, blogs, or anything else that has text and shows you where
to find them. In the language of experts, these are called keyboard Boolean
searches. The results are often ambiguous and inaccurate.
Of course, the challenge of text searching goes beyond the retrieval of
information. With trillions of words on the Internet, search engines need to

instantly scan sites and convert that information into something useful. Th e
software powering the searches use specialized programs called algorithms, or
algos, to zero in on the data.
Google has mastered search engine algorithms, constantly tweaking them
to produce even better results. But text mining goes way beyond looking up
something online. Almost all business sectors can utilize this technology.
For example, text mining is penetrating call rooms and customer service
functions—making it faster and easier to handle questions and complaints.
Reuters and Dow Jones are also developing text mining applications. And, of
course, fi nancial markets are just beginning to look at text mining. Th e fi eld
of text mining is evolving quickly with many new companies off ering text
search and semantic analysis services. Open source software such as GATE
( http://gate.ac.uk ) that processes text is now fully developed and available to
anyone. Th is software enables the ability to scan, retrieve, annotate text, and
identify concepts (see the sidebar for more information).
WHAT IS GATE?
GATE is the acronym for g eneral a rchitecture for t ext e ngineering. Professor
Ronen Feldman, co-founder and chief scientist of Digital Trowel, has been a
leader in applying text mining and sentiment analysis to fi nancial markets. His
case studies tracked sentiment changes in stocks for their predictive value. Does
a change in sentiment predict a change in stock price direction? His work is
discovering that it can be predictive (see more details at www.digitaltrowel .com).
At this time, text-mining tools are still focused on a single stock rather than a
sector. To have eff ective predictive results for a sector, a lot more work has to
be done to retrieve the right documents. If one wanted opinion about the gold
sector, just searching for gold would bring in many other unrelated documents.
When a search retrieves unrelated results, the eff ect is similar to a low signal/
noise ratio in physics. Special algorithms in these situations are needed to dis-
ambiguate the results.
Others in the fi nancial industry are applying text search tools to Twitter
and other social media to profi le mood changes. Research is ongoing on how
to use Twitter as a source of sentiment that has predictive value. A recent
study focused on using Twitter to predict next-day pricing of the S&P 100.
“We collected the tweets via Twitter’s REST API for streaming data using
symbols of the Standard and Poor’s 100 stocks (S&P 100) as keywords. In

this study, we focus only on predicting the S&P 100). The time period of our
dataset is between Nov. 2, 2101, and Feb. 7, 2013, which gave us 624,782
tweets.” They developed in their methodology a ratio of positive/negative
opinion words per day. They concluded:
Predicting the stock market is an important but difficult problem.
This paper showed that Twitter’s topic-based sentiment can improve
the prediction accuracy beyond existing non-topic based approaches.
(Si, Mukherjee, Liu, Li, Li, and Deng 2013, 28)
The challenge for usefully using Twitter as a crowd sourcing and sen-
timent prediction tool for trading is rooted in the problem of sampling
misrepresentation. Sampling Twitter followers would be very inaccurate as
a predictor without knowing who the Twitter users are and whether they are
representative of the overall population of traders. To be statistically reliable
and effective, Twitter data needs a lot of post-monitoring processing. At
best, Twitter-sentiment-based indicators would be a confirming indicator.
(See the site http://twittersentiment.appspot.com/, which takes a snapshot
of Twitter opinion.)
While the overall field of text searching for understanding the mood of
the market is getting better, the goal is to actually use the information to help
the trader. A next step would be to match the sentiment scans with price
action.
Text Mining Mood on the U.S. Dollar
Let’s look at an example involving the U.S. dollar index and the potential for
using text mining as a predictive tool.
SentiMetrix, a text-mining firm, conducted a test scan from April 17 to
May 15 of the Internet for sentiment on the U.S. Dollar Index. It showed
some promise (Figure 3.1). During a test period, the Internet was scanned
for mentions of the U.S. Dollar Index and then using natural language pro-
cessing (NLP), the documents were evaluated (not by humans) for emo-
tional tags regarding the U.S. dollar. The result was a sentiment polarity
index. While this is a small sample of one week, it demonstrates that opinion
mining regarding the U.S. dollar is possible and that certainly we can detect
shifts in positive and negative attitudes for the U.S. dollar. An improved
approach would be to generate a scan at a regular interval during the week
and then match the sentiment score to price action. Much more work

needs to be done to achieve predictive accuracy, but the goal of building
sentiment-leading indicators is worthy and exciting and rapidly gaining in
effectiveness.
In another example of matching sentiment against price action we can
see how positive and negative sentiment regarding crude oil correlates with
price action (Figure 3.2). News, blogs, video, and forums over the Internet
were scanned during the week of May 28 to June 9 on sentiment regarding
crude oil prices. Each day’s negative scores were converted into a line graph
and overlaid against each day’s positive scores. Then the actual Brent crude
oil prices were matched against these negative and positive lines. While this
is only a sample period, we can see that it is worthwhile to use sentiment
data as a gauge for price direction. A peak in negative sentiment on crude
oil occurred on May 31 as crude oil prices reached a high of 102.98. It was
followed by decline in crude oil prices. Sentiment reached a bottom nega-
tive score on June 5 and positive sentiment started bouncing up. Crude oil
prices rose back to the 102 area a few days later. While the data needs much
more granularity, we can sense, even at this early stage in the art and science
of sentiment-based signals that there are two key areas that will be useful
to the trader. First, when positive or negative sentiment crosses over, the
trader can use this as a clue that market opinion is shifting. It also appears
that sentiment peaks, whether positive or negative, are the key milestones
relating to subsequent price changes and offer great potential as a source of
trading signals.

The state of text mining is already evolving to a brand new level. The
first step was just grabbing words and counting them or transforming the
document into a statistical breakdown of sorts. It’s now at a point at which
millions of documents can be scanned virtually in seconds with a state-of-
the-art text retrieval system. But until machines can do natural language
processing at the level of humans, it will be up to the trader to initiate and
complete the task of sentiment mining. Let’s see how any trader can apply
this new technology every day to binary option trading.
The field of text mining sentiment continues to rapidly evolve
approaches to market prediction. A recent study (Wong, Liu, and Chiang
2014) reports the development of an algorithm based on news articles.
Here is what they did.
We identified 553 stocks that were traded from 1/1/2008 to
9/30/2013 and listed in at least one of the S&P 500, DJIA, or
Nasdaq stock indices during that period. We then downloaded open-
ing and closing prices2 of the stocks from CRSP.3 Additional stock
information was downloaded from Compustat. For text data, we
downloaded the full text of all articles published in the print ver-
sion of WSJ in the same period. We computed the document counts
per day that mention the top 1,000 words of highest frequency and
the company names of the 553 stocks. After applying a stoplist and
removing company names with too few mentions, we obtained a list
of 1,354 words.
It should yield results of better than 55.7 percent accuracy for predicting
daily price movements (Wong, Liu, and Chang 2014).

called R, one can extract tweets and measure the sentiment in those tweets
(see Zhao 2015).

Applying Your Own Sentiment Detection
When Trading Binaries
Th e fi rst step is to decide on what market sentiment the trader wants to
tag or monitor. What emotion is being expressed relating to a particular
market? Th is is where the rubber meets the road. Th e technology of text
searches at this point is still a dumb technology. Th e search function is
extremely fast in retrieving documents, but it is not that smart at fi ltering
out the noise. A lot of unrelated documents get retrieved. Th is is because
the Internet is full of unstructured text. It is a bag of words that has to be
categorized.
So the binary option trader is really more advanced than the search
engine, at least at specifying what to look for so the search engine retrieves
the right documents. Th is is called semantic processing . In February 2011,
IBM demonstrated a breakthrough in semantic processing and text search
when Watson won a contest on the TV show J eopardy . Watson, as you may
recall, is the name of the IBM computer system that competed against two
human competitors on Jeopardy . Th e breakthrough was that Watson wasn’t
just searching its memory banks for keywords—it also had to understand
how the words related to one another. In this era of Watson, computer pro-
grams will be important assistants in opinion mining and, as a result, it will
mean any person is able to quickly understand the mood of the market. Until
then, the trader has to do the work of a future Watson. But it can and should
be done for binary option trading. Here is how. It is not that hard to do
(Figure 3.3 ).

Let’s explore each key step on how any trader can apply sentiment
detection tools.
Step 1: Use Key Terms—Risk Appetite and Risk Aversion
A basic understanding of market forces generates the realization that there
are two major emotional forces that become expressed in the market. Those
forces are market moods on risk appetite and risk aversion. You can consider
them the major axis of sentiment. However, don’t attribute negative or posi-
tive associations with either term. They are neither good nor bad. Using the
words risk appetite and risk aversion helps describe where the crowd-mind
of market opinion is clustering. These two opinion pools are always in flux.
In the new fundamentals, sentiment trumps economics in affecting price
moves. This doesn’t mean fundamentals don’t count. It means that the market
is not only an information engine generating valuation, it is also an expecta-
tion engine, spewing out emotions. The words “risk appetite” are code for
market optimism, while risk aversions are code for market fear. Each week
the balance between risk appetite and risk fear constantly shifts and a virtual
war and struggle ensues for which force is dominant. The lingo of sentiment
science calls the resulting shift of sentiment sentiment polarity. The balance of
sentiment and stability will shape the direction and speed of price moves. The
binary option trader making a decision on direction is, in a very real sense,
measuring the emotions of the market. Weekly market direction reflects a
precarious balance of fears. There are many fears and traders should become

familiar with them. Fears shift from one polarity to the other and can do so
very quickly. For example, if fear of inflation is dominant, market direction
will tend to be bullish on commodity prices (Figure 3.4). Fear of U.S. defi-
cits becomes a force reflecting bearish sentiment toward the U.S. dollar. Fear
of Middle East instability, leads to price appreciation in crude oil. Fear of a
China slowdown, can lead to a bearish view of the Australian dollar and fears
of a global slowdown (see Figure 3.5).

Step 2: Scan for Specific Fears
Every Sunday evening and Monday morning, the binary option trader should
ask and answer the question: Which fears dominate the market this week? The
answers will point to likely market directions. But how can the average trader
quickly and effectively extract information? How can the average trader obtain
accurate Internet searches about the opinion that dominates the markets? For-
tunately, the rise of the Internet provides a medium that quickly transfers emo-
tional information. Emotions spread like molecules in a medium, reactive and
diffuse. Emotions are transferred throughout the medium and converted into
opinions. The boundary between information and sentiment often becomes
blurred. This effect has been described as part of a cycle of market information
processing: “The market reports by the news services often consist of trading
participants’ perceptions and interpretations of the market, which are then
fed back to the traders in the market” (Oberlechner 2004, 137). The task of
binary option trader is to filter the enormous bag of words that populate the
social media and come to some conclusion about the intensity of sentiment
regarding the underlying markets. To accomplish this, the binary option trader
has to become a sentiment miner. Don’t let the term scare you away. In a very
real sense we are all sentiment and opinion miners every time we use language.
Step 3: Scan Headlines
Could the average binary option trader use sentiment mining to help shape
their trades? If so, what everyday tools can be used by the trader to accurately
extract market sentiment? It turns out that anyone can become a good senti-
ment miner using a few tips. First, the challenge is to spot occurrences of key
terms that are tagged to the fundamental forces being searched. The main
idea is to find the right terms. This is known in sentiment science as Adjective-
Verb-Adverb (AVA) combinations and using opinion lexicon (Qiu 2011).
Traders scanning the web often see frequent references to the terms fear
and greed. But these terms are too coarse and do not offer the granularity
needed by the trader to accurately sketch the vectors of market opinion. The
task is to classify sentiment that better correlates to opinions about expected
market direction. There are three major, general, directional sentiments that
characterize market emotions: bullish, bearish, and neutral. But to be help-
ful to the trader on a timely basis, these classifications need to be further
unpacked and detailed. The words “bullish” and “bearish” are still at too gen-
eral a level. Being bullish or bearish is the result of a collection or the balance
of fears that make traders bullish or bearish or ambivalent. To successfully

==================================================

Sentiment Analysis: New Predictive Tools 37
extract information from the social media about these forces requires a greater
level of precision in the use of keywords and efficiency in search and retrieval.
The average individual does not have the more advanced text mining tools
that are emerging. But some basic strategies are effective.
Overlooked by many traders is the value of scanning headlines. Head-
lines provide a sentiment activation frame to capture fundamental opinion.
They are effective because they are constructed by opinion leaders as devices
to attract readers. Headlines may not be accurate as to representing actual
economic data, but they are effective strength-attribute indicators that show
the pulse of opinion. Headlines trigger excitation waves that actually take the
shape of a contagion. Particularly in this age of the Internet, headlines that
appear and disappear throughout the day and night provide real-time samples
of sentiment trends. One headline is often replicated throughout the Inter-
net, acting as a signal amplifier of sentiment.
The headline effect was very powerful when the rating agency Standard &
Poor’s announced its review of the U.S. government debt rating. The headline
was: Standard & Poor’s Puts “Negative” Outlook on U.S. Rating. The headline
triggered a big response throughout the market (Figure 3.6). The result was that
gold hit new highs in response.

Step 4: Form Your Own Keywords for Search Retrieval
Beyond headlines, another critical tool in the hands of the binary trader
are keywords. Monitoring keywords enables a quick test of the emotional
strength of bullish and bearish sentiment on a 24/7 basis. While there are
an enormous amount of keywords, there are certain words that enable a very
effective sampling and mapping of the sentiment in the market. This is not
a trivial task. But following the latest text mining strategies, the trick is to
use words that are not subject to too much ambiguity and to filter out noise
words that give no added value to the search (Qiu 2011).
Let’s start with some initial suggested generic words that should be
used. They are: “risk appetite,” “risk aversion,” “U.S. dollar,” “Yellin,”
“Draghi,” “deflation,” “employment,” “wages,” and “inflation.” These
words are effective because they result in a high level of precision for
retrieving the sentiment that the market is focused on. Think of each
word as a landmark that is associated with an emotion. By using key-
words, the trader is, in effect, doing shape science and finding the shape
of sentiment. In the context of the science of sentiment analysis, the chal-
lenge of correctly matching keywords to the correct sentiment the words
really reflect is called sentiment polarity text classification. The trader does
not want to mismatch.
The words therefore have to have what is called lexical cohesion. Luckily,
the use of words such as “risk aversion” and “risk appetite” have a high accu-
racy rate for retrieving and classifying the correct sentiment that goes with the
word. The words also have to have an ability to link to emotions that can be
categorized as positive and negative emotions. The positive emotions can also
be broken down into “positive, no doubt”; “positive, doubt”; “negative, no
doubt”; and “negative, doubt.”
Let’s apply this to the binary option trader scanning the web using key-
word groups. Let’s combine keywords with a set of verbs that are usually
linked to emotions. For example, instead of the name of a key central banker
(Yellen, Draghi, Carney (the trader can enter: “Yellen fears,” or “Draghi
fears” (Figure 3.7). Using the group of words “inflation fears” or “U.S. dollar
fears” enables a quick grab of words relating to negative emotions about
the dollar. The result is a greater detection of emotions. As a general rule,
combine the name of a key leader with verbs such as “admits,” “declares,”
“warns,” “supports,” “denies,” and so on. The result is a retrieval of news that
carries with it a lot of information about the emotions involved. A good idea
for any trader would be to create his or her own table of opinion seed words,
or a verbal quadrant.



==================================================
                     PAGE 42                      
==================================================

Sentiment Analysis: New Predictive Tools 39
These search strategies are flexible. It is a good idea to try different com-
binations to cast a wider net over the billions of words on the Internet. For
example, the trader could try:
CentralBanker + Adjectives
Yellen = fears,hopes,declares
Entering each combination of words results in a slightly different
grab, ensuring a wider and more diversified search. The effect is to pro-
vide a better match between the search and the retrieval of the emotion
involved.
Once an underlying binary option market is chosen, word searches
should become more targeted and specific. For example, if the currency pairs
were the subject of binary option trades for the week, specific searches using
the names of the key central bankers would be appropriate and effective.
For every binary option market there are specific keywords that should be
used. This is an area for which every trader can add his or her own creativity
and improve his or her effectiveness by constructing his or her own diction-
ary of market emotions. Here are suggested words for use at any time for
trying to gauge market sentiment. Start with any underlying market and
add the suggested keywords using the different word combination formula
(Figure 3.7).

underlying market + risk appetite
underlying market + risk aversion
underlying market + fears
underlying market + optimism
underlying market + doubts
underlying market + pessimism
underlying market + deflation
We can generalize the entire search process in one equation or algorithm.
It would be: underlying market + emotional adjective or adverb.
For example, for detecting U.S. dollar sentiment, a trader would generate
a search, possibly using the group of words, at different times: U.S. Dollar
Index risk appetite; U.S. Dollar Index risk aversion; U.S. Dollar Index fears;
U.S. Dollar Index doubts; U.S. Dollar Index optimism. The result is an abil-
ity to count the positive and negative news items relating to the U.S. Dollar
Index. This follows recent text mining and sentiment analysis methodology.
Peter Hafez of RavenPack, referring to this methodology, states, “One may
consider the sentiment ratio as the baseline for constructing market senti-
ment indices. As the ratio is measured as the count of positive to negative
news items, it indirectly takes into consideration changes in news volume”
(Hafez 2009).
Step 5: Create Your Own Risk Appetite/Risk Aversion Ranking
Since the words “risk appetite” and “risk aversion” are extremely effective as seed
words to retrieve market sentiment, the trader should always conduct a general
risk appetite and risk aversion search. By comparing the results of the search, the
ratio between risk appetite and risk aversion beliefs can be approximated.
After retrieving the results of using risk appetite and risk aversion, the next
step is to create your own sentiment ratio. The result is your own ability to
give a thumbs-up or thumbs-down assessment about the mood of the market.
The risk appetite/risk aversion ratio compares positive to negative sentiment
results from your own text searches. This is a good technique—until special
search engines can do a better job!
After doing a search for a good way to quantify the balance of risk appe-
tite to risk aversion, you need to assign a number to the article or headline.
Ask yourself: Is the article retrieved positive or negative about the underlying
market? Keep score. This helps keep track of the strength of the sentiment.
A useful technique is to use a ranking range of –5 to +5. If the total sum is
positive, you have, in effect, a market that is risk positive.

GOOGLE TRENDS AND WORD CLOUDS
Social media is becoming a source for sentiment analysis and even basic search
techniques and traders are beginning to use these tools to provide clues about
the shape of opinion related to an underlying market. Two of the most recent
tools are Google Trends and Word Clouds .
Th e millions of words in blogs, documents, and speeches form an unstructured
bag that needs to be made sense of by the trader. An established method is called
natural language processing to fi nd patterns among the words. Word frequency
analysis is particularly eff ective. Another technique is detecting the presence or
absence of words. For example, when the Federal Open Market Committee
(FOMC) issues a statement, any new phrase that occurs is carefully watched.
What is really important is a statement or remark that occurs only one time.
Th is is called a hapax legomena and in computer linguistics it is considered very
signifi cant. It is also signifi cant when it occurs in fi nancial statements. An example
would be the word “defl ation” suddenly appearing in a statement, but occurring
only one time. It would set off market reactions. Word frequency counters are
easily available and getting in the habit of conducting frequency analysis on key
statements will help reinforce a trader’s sense of the mood of the market.
Word clouds are also becoming popular and can become a very useful for
traders. Word frequency should be considered a fundamental indicator about
market mood and opinion. When applied correctly, they provide some addi-
tional perspective on changes in emphasis. Th ey help the trader visualize what
concerns the market at that moment. Here is a word cloud generated from
the FOMC statement when they raised interest rates on December 16, 2015
(Figure 3.8 ). It clearly shows the focus on infl ation rates as the key concern of
the FOMC. Th at word appeared very prominently.

In recent years, word cloud software has become multilingual, and even
the Chinese trader can use word clouds to quantify sentiment. Traders can use
several word cloud generators, such as W ordle, Tagul, and W ordItOut. Th ey are
all accessible on the Internet.

Chapter 4
Tracking Fundamental
Forces That Impact
Markets
A Primer for Binary Traders
While finding the predominant sentiment for the markets is important for
selecting the direction of trading in the coming week, basic fundamental eco-
nomic forces also affect the movement of prices. These forces are often in the
background, but remain important to monitor. The objective of this chapter
is to provide a basic understanding of the fundamental forces that a binary
option trader should know and track.
The relationship between economic fundamental forces and markets is
not linear. This means that tomorrow’s or next week’s price direction is not
directly predictable based on today’s or yesterday’s price patterns. Rather,
price action is more chemical in nature, similar to what chemists refer to as
a reaction-diffusion event, where an acid is dropped into a base and then the
reaction follows a non-linear path. The globalization of the world economy
promotes, of course, a gliding effect, in which a change in GDP growth,
inflation, interest rates, employment, wage growth, housing prices, in one
country, or market, generates ripples, and triggers a reaction and glides or cas-
cades across the world. The gliding medium is the World Wide Web. A trig-
ger event could be an earthquake, a sell-off in metals, a remark by a finance
minister, or many other exogenous events. The fact is that there is no place

to hide in the world economy. Once an event occurs, what is predictable is
that there will be a reaction. The reaction varies in relationship to the level of
surprise. Expectations therefore are itself a major fundamental force. After the
reaction, the market digests the news and experiences a diffusion of original
impact of the surprise.
The Fundamental Forces
The trader should now fear gaining knowledge about fundamental forces.
Fortunately, we have filtered the key forces that shape market movements.
Let’s begin our tour of fundamental forces and relationships by reviewing the
most global of all forces—China. We then review the impact of commodity
markets, gold, the U.S. dollar, and other forces that need to be understood to
build skills in trading binary options.
China and the Global Markets
There is no doubt that economic expectations on China’s growth are and will
increasingly become key drivers in the global economy. The importance of
China in the world economy is partially reflected by the IMF granting reserve
status to the Chinese currency, the yuan, on November 30, 2015. Clearly the
Chinese economy is integrating into the global economy. The binary trader
should recognize the impact of economic news coming from China. The
binary option trader needs to monitor China economic news for a variety
of reasons. China is the world’s production hub. It imports resources and
exports consumer products for the rest of the world. First, if growth in China
is strong, it will directly affect the entire world economy. Some underlying
markets are more directly affected by China’s economic surprises than others.
For example, China imports key resources from Australia and therefore trad-
ing the AUD/USD, and the copper binaries should be considered first when
China economic data releases relate to these markets (Figure 4.1).
The selloff in the Shanghai market lead to “black” Monday on August 24,
demonstrating how the sentiment of fear cascades through markets.
Secondly, when markets open Monday mornings in Asia, watching
whether the Shanghai Index is bullish or bearish gives a powerful clue to
which markets binary traders should focus on as the week opens. A classic
example is the market actions in August 2015 (Figure 4.2) relating to China’s
devaluation of the yuan on August 11.

Global Growth and Commodity Markets
In reviewing global market conditions, the trader will notice that an over-
arching theme is global growth and global slowdown. A good way to look
at growth is to visualize it as a process of cause and effect. Global growth
or expectations of growth (Figure 4.3) generate inflation, higher consumer
prices, higher commodity prices, and increased interest rates. At some
point, the increased interest rates start slowing down the growth to damper
inflation.
In a scenario of a global slowdown, the key fundamental forces reverse.
Low GDP expectations lead to lower demand for crude oil, lower commodity
prices, and equity markets become less attractive. The big fear is no longer
inflation, but deflation. The fear of deflation applies directly to the Eurozone
and to Japan, both of which have had a difficult time generating growth.
Traders need to monitor economic data releases on inflation in these coun-
tries to detect any changes in the potential for pushing prices higher.

Commodity Markets as a Global Fundamental Force
Commodity markets will continue to be a valuable source for detecting profitable
opportunities in binary option trading. A rise or fall in commodities should be
used to select and shape binary option trades. Depending on the size of a move, a
drop or spike in commodities spills over into the equity markets. The collapse of
oil to historic lows during December 2015 is a case in point (Figure 4.4).
The binary trader looking to trade oil needs to understand and take a mea-
sure of the trend or pattern that is in place. After a surge down, the trader can
try to join the sentiment and predict that oil will go further down. This requires
good timing on choosing the expiration. However, it is more likely to predict
that after a surge down crude oil will not likely bounce back. It will take a shift
in global growth levels or a decline in oil production to be bullish on crude oil.
Beyond the overall fundamental forces, the binary option trader should
track specific correlations between different markets and instruments. The
value of being updated on correlations lies in reducing risk as well as aug-
menting profits. When trading several different underlying markets at one
time, if two or more were highly correlated, the trader has the risk of incur-
ring a loss in all those markets that are correlated. Of course, the potential of
being correct increases and is augmented. Generally, reducing risk is achieved
by trying to trade have less correlated markets during the trading period.

Correlations and Co-Movement useful for Trading
Binary Markets
Let’s review some important correlations and co-movements that binary trad-
ers ought to know. These include, but are not limited to: the Aussie dollar and
copper, gold and the U.S. dollar, the USD/JPY and the S&P 500, as well as a
set of fears that act as market forces.
China, the Shanghai Index, AUD/USD, and Copper
On August 11, 2015 China devalued the RMB and caused a major reaction
in the Shanghai Index and subsequently in the S&P 500 index (Figure 4.5).
The impact of China economic data on global markets is increasing and the
binary trader should continue to play close attention to the Shanghai Index
and the value of the Chinese yuan.
A correlation that should also not be ignored is the AUD/USD co-
movements with copper (Figure 4.6).
Both the copper and the AUD/USD binaries can be treated as essentially
trading the same event. Copper can be used as a directional indicator for
strength or weakness in the Aussie and vice versa. We can see the close rela-
tionship between copper and the Aussie (Figure 4.6). There are times when the

correlation between the AUD/USD and copper approaches over 90 percent,
and there are times when the relationship hits a disconnect and there is no
correlation. The trader should not take for granted a consistently high cor-
relation between the AUD/USD and copper markets.
Gold
Gold is often treated as a risk-aversion basket, attracting capital in times of
crises. It’s important, though counter-intuitive, for the trader to realize that
gold can be sold off if the crisis is so big that it requires the selling of gold
to raise capital. Traders betting that gold will always rise in response to cri-
ses, therefore, have to be careful. Such rises in gold occur, but when it is a
response to a crisis, it is likely to be temporary. Consider the gold movements
in reaction to the Paris Terrorist attacks of November 14, 2015 (Figure 4.7).

From a more macroeconomic and fundamental force perspective, gold
acts as a hedge against inflation. Gold generally attracts capital when the
market fears inflation or a major financial or global crisis. In recent years,
inflation rates in the United States and globally has been well contained. The
price of gold therefore declined in the context of a low-inflation world. Gold
can attract capital when it is perceived as an asset that holds and increases
value. When interest rates are expected to go up, money is attracted to where
it will be making a greater return. That is why gold usually surges when there
is surprise bad news on jobs (Figure 4.8). For example, on January 10, 2014,
gold spiked up on a very bad NFP report.
Binary traders, after considering the fundamental expectations on inter-
est rates, should always review the gold price pattern that is in force. This can
be an intraday pattern. Is it going parabolic? Is it in a sideways range? Is it at
key resistance or support levels?

For the binary option trader in the coming years, the most important
aspect in looking at the gold market is to assess whether interest rates are
expected to move gradually or more aggressively. On December 16, 2015,
the Federal Reserve increased interest rates 25 basis points. Th e statement
they issued is very valuable to read carefully for insight on what the Federal
Reserve monitors. Th erefore, we are printing it in its entirety right here.
FOMC STATEMENT, DECEMBER 16, 2015
Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in
October suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace.
Household spending and business fi xed investment have been increasing at solid
rates in recent months, and the housing sector has improved further; however,
net exports have been soft. A range of recent labor market indicators, including
ongoing job gains and declining unemployment, shows further improvement
and confi rms that underutilization of labor resources has diminished apprecia-
bly since early this year. Infl ation has continued to run below the Committee’s
2 percent longer-run objective, partly refl ecting declines in energy prices and in
prices of nonenergy imports. Market-based measures of infl ation compensation
remain low; some survey-based measures of longer-term infl ation expectations
have edged down.
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster
maximum employment and price stability. Th e Committee currently expects
that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activ-
ity will continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will
continue to strengthen. Overall, taking into account domestic and international
developments, the Committee sees the risks to the outlook for both economic
activity and the labor market as balanced. Infl ation is expected to rise to 2 percent
over the medium term as the transitory eff ects of declines in energy and import
prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. Th e Committee con-
tinues to monitor infl ation developments closely.
Th e Committee judges that there has been considerable improvement in
labor market conditions this year, and it is reasonably confi dent that infl ation
will rise, over the medium term, to its 2 percent objective. Given the economic
outlook, and recognizing the time it takes for policy actions to aff ect future
economic outcomes, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the
federal funds rate to 1/4 to 1/2 percent. Th e stance of monetary policy remains
accommodative after this increase, thereby supporting further improvement in
labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent infl ation.

                     PAGE 56                      
==================================================

Tracking Fundamental Forces That Impact Markets 53
In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target
range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expect-
ed economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment
and 2 percent infl ation. Th is assessment will take into account a wide range
of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of
infl ation pressures and infl ation expectations, and readings on fi nancial and
international developments. In light of the current shortfall of infl ation from
2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress
toward its infl ation goal. Th e Committee expects that economic conditions
will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal
funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below
levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path
of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by
incoming data.
Th e Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal
payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securi-
ties in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury
securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level
of the federal funds rate is well under way. Th is policy, by keeping the Commit-
tee’s holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain
accommodative fi nancial conditions.
Th e word cloud shows that the important focus for the future of rate
decisions will be on infl ation rates (Figure 4.9 ).

U.S. Dollar
The U.S. dollar is a generic term that is really an aggregate category and
is quite vague. It has many references and associations. It needs to be
disambiguated for it to be used by the binary option trader. An effective
way to monitor U.S. dollar conditions and global sentiment regarding
the U.S. dollar is to use the U.S. dollar index. It is an index that consists
of several currencies in a basket and each component currency is given
different weights. A common concern among traders is that this index is
not really representative of global trade interactions. They are correct. A
trade-weighted U.S. dollar index is more accurate and is used by the Federal
Reserve and economists to evaluate the global strength of the dollar. But what
is really important is that the U.S. dollar index is considered by the market
to be an important indicator and therefore it has to be understood and
monitored (Table 4.1).
Let’s start with the U.S. dollar relationship with gold. They are inversely
related most of the time. When gold goes up, the U.S. dollar goes down,
and vice versa (Figure 4.10). The dollar acts as a haven basket in times of
gold selloffs. Since the U.S. dollar index is not directly a binary option
underlying market, the USD/CHF can be considered a good surrogate for
playing this haven relationship (Figure 4.11). Also important to note is that
the trader can use the exchange traded fund (ETF) UUP for tracking the
U.S. dollar index (Figure 4.12). They are virtually identical and the added
bonus is that the ETF UUP also offers option data to enable the trader to
evaluate puts and calls on the UUP as a gauge on sentiment regarding the
U.S. dollar.

Fear of Deflation/Inflation
The dominant fundamental force relating to the dollar is fear. It’s either fear
of inflation or fear of a deflation reflected in a declining economy. It’s surely
complicated, particularly in the post-2008 financial collapse period that ush-
ered in an era of very low rates and government increase of the money supply,
known as quantitative easing. In November 2014, quantitative easing came
to an end. The result may be, if the economy was stronger, expectations of
increase in interest rates, and a dollar bullish climate. But the fear factor is
real. There is fear of the U.S. government not being able to control its spend-
ing, and this leads to a weakness in the currency as confidence in the United
States declines as a place for investments. This is not, however, certain, since
problems elsewhere are often much worse. Generally, the macro force can
be understood as: When the U.S. equity market is strong, the dollar loses
its attractiveness—unless the U.S. equity market is so strong that interest
rates are expected to go up! The converse situation is not always applicable.
The U.S. dollar can at times be nearly 100 percent correlated with a positive
direction in the S&P and at other times, just the opposite (Figure 4.13).
When U.S. equity markets sell off, the U.S. dollar may also sell off—if the
trigger event was fear of lack of growth or financial instability.
The general market weakness in recent years of the U.S. dollar is a specific
case of currency weakness due to a fear of financial instability. Recently, the
Eurozone has become a victim of the fear of financial instability, and often

making the weak dollar a haven currency. This fear hit the EUR/USD over
the problems of Greece, Spain, and Portugal. In the coming years, it is a
near-certainty that the Eurozone will present the trader with many opportu-
nities where fear of financial instability related to sovereign debt distorts price
movements and increases volatility. It is therefore appropriate for the trader to
understand sovereign debt as a force for underlying market movements and,
in particular, currency moves (Figure 4.14).

A theme to watch out for in trading binary options is news relating to
deficits and unfunded liabilities facing countries. This fear often appears in
the news, particularly regarding the U.S. government’s debt. The fear that
the debt levels are unsustainable often triggers a selloff in the U.S. dollar. The
same fear of deficits and financial instability causes bearish sentiment regard-
ing the euro when the debt problems facing Ireland, Greece, Spain, and so on
appear in the news. It also causes an increase in the cost of insuring against
a government default. We can see that a Greek two-year bond has interest
payments much higher than the German two-year bond yield, reflecting the
extra fear premium that the market imposed on Greece to make its bonds
more attractive (Figure 4.15). While monitoring differences in government
bond yields is a more advanced monitoring technique for the average trader,
it is important to understand the fear of sovereign debt default is, and will
continue to be, a major fundamental force.
This fear is not unfounded. Several countries are approaching huge finan-
cial burdens. It is often expressed as a percentage of the country’s total Gross
Domestic Product. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Devel-
opment (OECD) tracks the key metrics of an economy (Table 4.2). We can
see how different countries compare on this financial burden measure. Notice
that the U.S. government deficit is now equal to what the United States pro-
duces in one year!

Notice that the United States’s liabilities as a percentage of GDP has

Foreign Ownership of u.S. Treasuries
Another important sentiment indicator about the dollar is the amount and
change in the holdings of U.S. Treasuries (Table 4.3) by foreign buyers. The
U.S. Treasury International Capital System (TIC) report provides this infor-
mation. China is the top owner of U.S. debt, purchasing $1.1 trillion of
U.S. Treasuries! What would happen if China decided to slow down such
purchases? The dollar would severely and negatively react. When rumors circulate
that China may diversify away from such purchases, the U.S. dollar reacts with
weakness. But it’s important to realize that a precipitous decline in foreign
purchases of U.S. debt is unlikely and would hurt those countries, such as
China and Japan, which primarily also own almost $1 trillion worth of U.S.
Treasuries. It’s not only the amount they own, but whether the trend is up or
down from the previous months or years.
An excellent index that tracks U.S. financial conditions is the Bloomberg
U.S. Financial Conditions Index. The chart can be found at www.bloomberg
.com/apps/quote?ticker=BFCIUS:IND.
Notice how the index plunged in September 2008 when the global
financial collapse occurred (Figure 4.16). Also notice it recovered to near pre-
collapse levels. This index, when it changes, provides important clues as to the
larger financial economic U.S. conditions.

Crude Oil and the Historic Oil Price Plunge
Crude oil presents another major fundamental force in the world markets that
binary option traders need to follow. Essentially, the demand for oil is based on
global growth. If more growth is expected, more oil will be needed. Oil price
valuation becomes a basic relationship between supply and demand. Surprise
supplies dampen the price, and surprise shortages increase the price. Oil prices

also can increase when there is a global crisis, particularly a crisis centered in the
Middle East, since that region produces the majority of the world’s oil supplies.
Note: Binary oil options are not on the more popular Brent crude oil con-
tract, but it is on the West Texas Intermediate (WTI). However, they move
very closely, but not perfectly, together (Figure 4.17). It is also noteworthy
about the relationship between oil prices and the U.S. dollar. A strong dollar
results in lower oil prices. Also, when oil prices fall back, the effect is a stimu-
lus in exports. High oil prices result in a weaker dollar as the U.S. trade defi-
cit increases. This lowers the GDP. The relationship between the U.S. dollar
and crude oil prices overall is a negative co-movement (Figure 4.18). A very
acceptable way of trading oil in the binary market is to trade the USD/CAD
cross pair because Canada is an oil exporter (tar sands oil) and when oil prices
increase, the Canadian dollar tends to strengthen against the U.S. dollar. But
note that this is only opposite because of the currency pair being the USD/
CAD. If the chart is CAD/USD, the co-movements of oil and the Canadian
dollar would be in the same direction (Figure 4.19).
The historic selloff in oil during 2015 offers a good example of the power of
binary option out-of-the-money trading strategies. The strategies that best apply
to big selloffs are breakout binary plays and deep-out-of-the-money plays. This
points to a mixed strategy in which a portion of the trades put on are always
deep-out-of-the-money plays mixed with ATM and in-the-money plays. When
a big move happens, the deep-out-of-the-money plays will catch the moves.
Keep in mind when a big bullish move happens, buying a deep-in-the-money
position goes with the crowd. If a selloff occurs, betting that it won’t go back up
by selling a deep-in-the-money resistance leg is an appropriate strategy.

The eur/uSD for Binary Trading
The Eurozone was feared to collapse because of the Greek debt crises. It sur-
vived it, but the Euro itself has been in a bearish trend since reaching on April
20, 2014, the high of 1.3867 (Figure 4.20). This is mainly due to the lack of
inflation in the Eurozone. The European Central Bank under Draghi has a
goal of stimulating the Eurozone and therefore has had a policy of monetary
expansion. This is in great contrast to the end of monetary expansion in the
United States. The binary trader of the EUR/USD needs to not only carefully
assess the price patterns in the euro, but be very diligent relating to economic
reports on eurozone inflation. These reports are likely to move the EUR/
USD. The binary trader should be watching when the ECB issues its interest
rate and monetary policy reports. In the coming years, the weakness in the
EUR/USD points to the potential for the EUR/USD to have parity with the
U.S. dollar.
Carry Trade and Interest rate Differentials
At this point we have reviewed specific powerful global fundamental forces
that help traders understand what moves markets. In recent years, global
interest rates remained at historic low levels in order to stimulate growth

after the financial collapse in September 2008. However, interest rates have
begun to increase at least in the United States, and this might be ushering in
a period of tightening of monetary policy, and tightening rates. The result is
the return (it never really left) of one of the most important forces that move
currencies: interest rate differentials. These can be considered the jet stream of
the currency market! Any binary option trader looking to trade the currency
pairs offered by Nadex (USD/JPY, USD/CAD, USD/CHF, EUR/USD,
EUR/JPY, GBP/JPY, AUD/UST, GPB/USD) must understand how interest
rate differentials and expectations move price action. We could write a book
about this subject alone. Namely, interest rates and interest rate differences
are prime forces that move the currency pairs (Table 4.4). Another way to
view the interest rate force is to see it as a global jet stream of the money flows.
Here is how it works. In a very basic way, currencies will strengthen if
the interest rates of the economy are expected to increase in value. They will
weaken if the interest rates are expected to decline. Central banks have the
role through monetary policy to adjust interest rates to control and minimize
inflation. Higher rates discourage economic activity and are used as a throttle
when an economy is perceived to be growing too fast.
But that is only part of the story. In currency trading, the value of one
currency is always assessed against the value of another currency. That is why
they are called currency pairs. For example, the EUR/USD is a currency pair
in which the euro is traded against the U.S. dollar. For this pair, when the
European Central Bank increases interest rates, and the United States does
not, the net effect is bullish for the euro against the dollar, because money will
tend to be attracted to where it is paid a higher rate.
A quick check of the major interest rates associated with the different
currencies reveals dramatic differences between some. We can locate the cur-
rencies with the lowest interest rates (JPY, CHF, USD), and then locate the
currencies with the highest rates (AUD, NZD). This leads to a strategy called
the carry trade. This strategy involves selling low interest rate currencies (or
borrowing money to do so) and then buying high interest rate currencies. It
is no coincidence that the Aussie is the highest, as it experienced demand for
its resources. But going too high is dangerous. If a currency gets very high
in value against another currency, it actually slows down the economy of the
high priced currency because a higher currency value means exports are less
competitive. But it may also trigger a recession. Ultimately, the process is
cyclical and self-correcting.
As U.S. interest rates start increasing, in effect, buying the U.S. dollar
becomes a carry trade strategy, as other countries do not increase their rates.

Central Bankers Move the Markets
The binary option trader needs to track impending central bank decisions
and statements. Their words are powerful triggers for market sentiment to
cascade through the social media. By closely following central bank state-
ments and minutes, the trader will get, in advance, one of the best leading
indicators for whether conditions are suitable for different trading strategies.
When a central bank statement is due, consider an out-of-the-money strategy.
It is more appropriate than a deep-in-the-money strategy, because there is a
high potential for a surprise in the statement.
Checklist for Currency Pairs
Trading binary options in currency pairs provides a virtual round-the-clock
opportunity from the opening of the Asian session on Monday morning until
the close of the New York session. Depending on the firm, actual opening and
closing times for trading may vary.
There are several items that the trader should know about in evaluating
market conditions relating to the currency pairs. A key feature is that cur-
rency prices are not random and reflect major economic forces and sentiment
expectations. The following are some of the terms to study and know in order
to evaluate currency pairs.
• Interest rate expectations: Interest rate expectations are the key drivers of
currency-pair price action. When interest rates are expected to rise, the cur-
rency pair will become more attractive and therefore attract demand. The
general effect is the pair increases in value.
• Relative growth: If one country is growing faster than another, the currency
of the stronger growth country will tend to be stronger as it attracts capital.
• Data releases: Currency pairs are extremely sensitive to economic data
releases. Disappointing GDP results in a weakening of the currency. Sur-
prise positive data generally increases the value of the currency.
• Resistance and support: These daily and weekly levels are important for cur-
rencies as $5 trillion a day is exchanged; intraday movements are subject to
noise trading and not that meaningful.
• Commodity-based currency pairs: The USD/CAD and the AUD/USD, are
the main commodity-based pairs and move in reaction to commodity
markets.

• Cross pairs: These exclude the U.S. dollar. Binary options on GBP/JPY and
EUR/JPY are available. Cross pairs exhibit more predictable patterns be-
cause the U.S. dollar is excluded and this removes a lot of potential noise.
Bitcoin as a Binary
Bitcoin has emerged as a new underlying market for binary traders. It is now
being offered on the Nadex and IG market platforms. Also, many OTC
firms offer Bitcoin binaries. There are two important points that the binary
trader should have in mind when trading Bitcoin binaries. First, Bitcoin has
great volatility. Sudden movement happens without clues leading up to those
movements. The result is that out-of-the money buy or sell trades make the
most sense. Second, Bitcoin actual prices are not transparent. At Nadex, a
new index called TeraBitcoin Index is used to provide the quote stream at
Nadex. At IG, Bitcoin (XBT/USD) quotes are a composite of the price of
Bitcoin from several Bitcoin exchanges.
But at other binary firms, which offer Bitcoin high-low binaries, it is not
at all transparent which Bitcoin exchange is used. For those who trade Bitcoin
binaries, there is, however, a major advantage: Bitcoin prices are the least cor-
related with the other underlying markets and this in theory reduces the total
volatility of a return of the total portfolio of the trader.
using an economic Calendar as Trading Tool
The economic data calendar should be thought of as a key fundamental anal-
ysis and binary option trading tool. Many sites offer economic calendars and
they are easy to access. It is so important that no one should trade without the
calendar being reviewed first. Not knowing that an economic data release is
scheduled to appear leaves your binary option trade subject to great risk. The
economic calendar provides a critical and advanced alert function for the
binary option trader. It lists the time of economic data releases. These releases
provide key measures relating to economic performance in countries around
the world. The markets pay close attention to these releases and react to any
surprises in them. In weeks in which key economic data releases will occur,
there is certain to be greater volatility.
The binary option trader has two basic approaches relating to trading the
economic data releases. The first approach is to view economic data releases as
a factor in raising the overall volatility level of the markets during that week.

Greater volatility benefi ts strategies that choose deeper-out-of-the-money
strike prices because of the tendency of prices to move with greater momen-
tum in reaction to surprise announcements. But a cautionary note is in order
regarding volatility. It is not simply the level of volatility that is important,
but its rate of change. When volatility is at extremes, it can be a reversal
signal. Traders view high volatility as a sell signal and low volatility as a buy
signal. How to track volatility will be reviewed in a later chapter.
Alternatively, the trader can view a particular economic data release as a
directly tradable event. In this context, the trader can anticipate a bullish or
bearish direction, and choose a corresponding strike price. However, what
happens if the trader wants to trade a big surprise, but doesn’t know which
way the market will react? He can, in fact, use binary option trading to play
a breakout in either direction. Th is is similar to a straddle strategy in regular
options. A third approach is to wait for the economic release to occur and
develop a trading strategy after the market reaction to the news.

Chapter 5
Basic Technical Analysis
This chapter reviews basic technical analysis that will help shape binary
option trading. If you are a beginning trader, going through the key technical
analysis steps will help you develop core skills that can be applied in any
market. Binary option trading is an ideal place for a new trader and this
chapter provides a review of basic technical analysis concepts and techniques
that will help improve the skill level of the binary option trader. The more
experienced trader can use it as a quick review or skip these sections.
Confirming fundamental conditions through technical indicators is a key
phase for preparing to trade binary options. Beginning traders have a tendency
to anchor their trades on one indicator or type of information. But making a
trading decision is multi-dimensional. It is really about pattern recognition. Ask
yourself what pattern the underlying market is in. Is the underlying market trend-
ing up, down, or sideways? Is the price experiencing an increasing momentum?
Is it at extremes? Is volatility low or high? Is it testing support or resistance?
These and other questions come quickly to the mind of the trader who needs to
effectively prepare for trading binary options. They become, in effect, a checklist
of technical conditions that need to be reviewed. Let’s look at candlesticks, trend
lines, and support and resistance lines. These three categories create a solid foun-
dation for trading, and apply very effectively to binary option trading decisions.
Key Candlestick Patterns
If you are new to trading, you need to become familiar with candlesticks.
Candlesticks are a common way to represent price activity. They originated
with the Japanese when they were trading rice hundreds of years ago. Today,

candlestick patterns are the most popular way to represent price activity. Let’s
start with understanding the basic structure of candles (Figure 5.1).
Each candle has four parts. Wicks represent the lowest and highest points
reached. There is the body, which has a top and bottom representing the open
and close prices. These four components are, in effect, the DNA of price
action. Any emotion in the market is ultimately represented in the candle-
stick pattern.
A candle can represent price activity for almost any desired time frame.
There can be one-minute, five-minute, one-hour, one-day, one-week, and
one-month candles. When a trader selects a time period, the candle repre-
sents that time frame. For example, 50 candles on a 5-minute time period
represents 50 × 5 minutes, or 250 minutes of price activity.
One of the most important and basic features of the candlestick is its color.
It is conventional to have a white candle representing a bullish activity and a
black candle representing a bearish activity. Many charts allow traders to use
their own colors to represent being bullish or bearish. Let’s look at what being
bullish or bearish really mean in the context of what the candlestick is doing.
A bullish candle is one in which the close price is above the opening
price. A bearish candle is one in which the close price is below the opening.
Basically, the direction is either north or south! There are times when the
open and close are the same or nearly the same. The candles are then neither
bullish nor bearish. This represents indecision or hesitation. Candles are all
about expressing the emotion in the market. They are, in fact, emotional

landmarks. It is commonplace to look at the market as a battle between buy-
ers and sellers. If this is so, then the candlesticks are snapshots in time of
who is winning that battle. All the patterns of the market that are possible
are really single candles grouped together representing the price activity as
it moves in time. There are many candle patterns; following are some of the
most important ones: Hammer (Figure 5.2), Doji (Figure 5.3), Spinning Tops
(Figure 5.4), Engulfing Candles (Figure 5.5), and Tweezers (Figure 5.6).
It’s a good idea to study these patterns and try to get familiar with them
in the context of market action. They will confirm the emotional status of the
market. Hammer patterns are called that because they look like a hammer.
It is characterized by having a long wick, sometimes twice the body size.
When a hammer appears, it is usually a reversal sign. Dojis are very impor-
tant in showing hesitation and indecision. There is virtually no body since
the open and close price points turn out to be nearly the same. Spinning
tops are related to market indecision as well since they have small bodies. The
engulfing candle is considered a very good indicator of a change in the mood
of the market. It is a pattern of a small candle followed by a very big body
of an opposite color. That is why it is called engulfing. Tweezer candles dem-
onstrate strong support or resistance. When a tweezer is at the bottom, the
bears have failed to push the price lower. When tweezer formations are at the
top of a candle, it signifies a failure to push the price higher. It is important
to keep in mind that the predictability of the emotion signified by a candle-
stick is related to the time frame. One-minute candles are not as predictive as
one-hour candles. In binary option trading, four-hour and one-day candles
provide a good source of reliable emotional information about the market.

Trend Lines
Trend lines are one of the basic tools for trading in all markets. But even
though trend lines are basic, they remain one of the most important and
effective tools a binary option trader can use. The trader who learns how to
use trend lines for shaping a diagnosis of the market patterns is likely to rely
a lot less on the many technical indicators that are commonly used. Let’s
explore trend lines further. First, let’s define our terms. There are two types of
trends: an uptrend and a downtrend.



==================================================
                     PAGE 76                      
==================================================

74 Trading Binary Options
An uptrend is a situation in which the prices keep getting higher highs and
also higher lows. A downtrend occurs when there are lower highs and lower lows.
Trend lines help the binary option trader find the condition of the sentiment
in the market. In fact, we can restate what a trend is in terms of sentiment. It
can be viewed as a persistence of sentiment. When the trader determines that the
sentiment is strong, the binary option strategy that makes sense is to go with the
sentiment. If the trader determines that the sentiment is very strong, the choices
are more difficult. A very strong trend may be a prelude to a continuation of the
action; however, it may also be a contra-indicator that the price is ready to reverse.
We can see that the power of trend analysis is its ability to project into
the future. Trend lines are not indicators, and they are not lagging. They are,
in fact, sentiment maps that define the boundary between optimism and fear.
Many beginning traders don’t know how to draw a trend line and as a
result misjudge the price action. To ensure that you know how to draw a
trend line correctly, let’s review the key steps involved. First, we present the
steps in drawing a downtrend line (Figure 5.8). Second, we present the steps
in drawing an uptrend line (Figure 5.9).

The steps for drawing a downtrend line are:
1. Locate the recent high.
2. Draw a line next to the immediate lower high.
3. Extend the line to the right end of the chart beyond the latest date into
the future.
The steps for drawing an uptrend line are:
1. Find lowest low.
2. Find the next higher low following the lowest low.
3. Draw a line from the lowest low to the higher low and extend it into the
future.
The trend lines need to only connect the candlestick lows or highs and
not the candle bodies. Figure 5.10 shows an incorrect drawing of the lines.
Beyond understanding how to draw trend lines, the trader needs to be
able to detect whether there is an outer and an inner trend. The presence of
an inner trend line indicates a shift in sentiment and momentum and should

be an alert that conditions are changing fast. The trader can also use the outer
trend line as a boundary where the price will have difficulty in breaking. So
finding an outer and inner trend line helps locate the right binary option
strike price (Figure 5.11).
A useful exercise is to profile the trend conditions. Try to answer the
questions: Is the price above or below the day trend line in the intended direc-
tion of the trade? Is the 50-day moving average in agreement with the trend
direction? Is the 21-day moving average above or below the 50-day moving
average? (See Figure 5.12.)
Support and resistance
A foundation for all of trading is being able to describe what the price activ-
ity is doing on a chart. Reading the chart is a process of identifying and
describing where the price is and what it is doing. A basic tool is resistance

and support lines (Figure 5.13). They provide evidence where the emotions
of the market are clustered. Let’s define some key terms and illustrate it in
a chart.
Support is where the price stops falling and comes to a temporary rest.
This area is called support. It is as if the price stopped falling and is resting on
a floor. Resistance is the point at which the price stops rising and comes to a
pause. It is as if a ceiling has formed.
The first step in drawing a resistance or support line is to locate the price
action on the chart (Figure 5.14). In reviewing the price movement, try to
answer the questions: Where is the most recent low? Where is the most recent
high? Then draw a horizontal line under the low and then above the high.
Support and resistance do not form instantly. Confirmation is usually needed
to be sure that there is a zone of support. This often means waiting to see
three failed attempts to break support or resistance.

Finding support and resistance is one of the first steps in developing a
trading strategy. If a trader wants to buy into the market, one of the best
locations to buy will be near a support area. If a trader wants to sell into the
market, one of the best locations to sell will be near a resistance area. This is
because if there is strong support, it is likely that a low in the price has been
established and if there is strong resistance, it is likely that a high in the price
has been established. Trading near support and resistance helps achieve the
goal of buying low and selling high. In short, once a support line or resistance
line is established, it has identified for you a top and a bottom. Locating a
support and resistance line is also important because it will help reduce the
risk of loss of a trade.
Another feature of support and resistance lines is what happens when
a price goes through a support line and falls below it. What happens when
a price goes through a resistance line and pushes above it? When these
events occur, and they occur all the time, the support line begins to act as
a new resistance line. The resistance line begins to act as a new support line
(Figure 5.15). We can see this shift and intimate relationship between sup-
port and resistance in Figure 5.16.
An important question that should be asked is this: How strong is the
support or resistance? The stronger the support or resistance lines, the greater
the confidence the trader has in using these lines to shape a trade. There are
many ways of identifying the degree of weakness or strength of support and

resistance lines. The first tool is the price itself. If a support or resistance
line has been touched many times, this indicates that the line is strong and
holding the price from going through it. Many traders use three touches to
confirm that the lines are good lines to locate possible entry positions. It’s
useful to keep in mind that higher time frames provide more evidence of the
strength of support or resistance. When a price action is probing a day sup-
port or resistance line, it is evidence that sentiment is changing much more
than a price action probing an hourly support or resistance line. This logic
further confirms that four-hour, day, and one-week price action charts should
be the basis for trading weekly binary option contracts.
As you can see, support and resistance is not one-dimensional. Making
a judgment about the strength of support and resistance requires a multiple
time analysis as well as looking at the price action in relationship to other
patterns such as Bollinger Bands and the presence or absence of doji candles
(Figure 5.17).

Confirming Strength with Price Break Charts
Because detecting direction in the underlying market is so important, the
trader should look to confirm the decisions and conclusions made using the
basic trend line, candlestick, resistance, and support tools. A very powerful
chart tool and technique to use is price breaks. The book Sentiment Indicators
provides a very detailed view of price break charts for the very serious trader,
but this chapter provides a basic understanding necessary for applying it to
binary option trading.
Price break charts have their origins with Japanese traders. There was
little Western awareness of them until the publication of Steve Nison’s book,
Beyond Candlesticks: New Japanese Charting Techniques Revealed (Nison 1994).
In effect, this book reintroduced price break charts to the United States. Price
break charts provide a powerful ability to detect the strength of a trend and
where it will end. As a result, they can be a very effective tool for binary
option trading. Let’s first look at the basics of price break charts.

Price break charts look like candlesticks without the wicks. Th ey are
bricks or columns. A good way to view them is as steps up or steps down in
the direction that the sentiment is taking. Th ey usually have a black color for
a down move and a white color for an upward move. Th e key condition that
determines the generation of a black brick is whether a new low has been
created. If a new low has been created, a new black column is added or
painted onto the chart. If a new high has been reached, then a new white
column appears (Figure 5.18 ). If no new low or high has been achieved, noth-
ing is added. One of the most benefi cial aspects of price break charts is the
clarity of their rules. Because they operate on close prices, there is no room
for dispute (Figure 5.19 ).

Price break charts may seem simplistic because they result from a simple
set of rules, but they unleash a great deal of technical analysis. From the per-
spective of sentiment analysis, by registering only the occurrences when a price
is establishing a new high or a new low, the chart is in effect visualizing the per-
sistence of sentiment. The price’s ability to persist in setting new highs or new
lows provides a way to quantify trends other than by using traditional trend
analysis. It goes beyond the simple criterion of having higher highs and higher
lows, or lower highs and lower lows. When we say a trend is in place, don’t we
mean that there is a persistence of sentiment? Viewing it from the perspective
of persistence, the trader can begin to quantify how serious a trend is, when
it is weakening, and when it has reversed. Price break charts measure this per-
sistence in an unambiguous way. Using price break charts, the trader cannot
dispute the facts of the price action; either the price has succeeded in persisting
higher or lower, or it has not. The trader also knows in advance where a price
break chart would be considered strong enough to break the trend.

Pattern of Block Sequences
The presence of block sequences is a key visual clue. If there is a long series of
blocks, the trend direction is strong but can in fact be entering an end phase.
A good idea is to look for very small sized blocks. This shows hesitation and
presents the trader with a clue to an impending breakout (Figure 5.20). The
trader’s task is to evaluate when a long series is in fact in its end stage. There
is no definitive, preset rule regarding how many consecutive blocks represent
an entry into an overextended area. Block sequences will vary by instrument
and by time interval. A good idea is for the trader to scan the sequences that
have appeared over the previous week and determine how many consecutive
blocks have actually appeared. This approach ensures that the sentiment of
the immediate environment is captured, rather than a predefined view that
eight or 10 consecutive blocks represent a series that is about to end. If, for
example, a trader using a five-minute price break chart determines that there
have not been more than 21 consecutive black or white blocks, the trader
can assume that if a series is in place that is approaching 21 blocks, there is
a high probability that a reversal is about to occur. This kind of perusal of
block sequences works very well. A more precise quantification is not difficult
to achieve for the diligent, more mathematically inclined trader. In fact, one
can generate a bell curve or standard deviation analysis of block sequences. It
is also not an accident that Fibonacci resistance lines, when applied to price
break chart blocks, often coincide with projected reversal points.

==================================================

Basic Technical Analysis 85
We need to state strongly that price break charts do not predict the com-
ing of a reversal. They do tell us where such a reversal would be considered
significant. Price break charts actually and precisely define and project where,
not when, such a price reversal will appear. By definition, a reversal block will
appear if the price gives back or retraces a given number of previous highs or
lows! The trader knows in advance where a reversal will be powerful enough
to generate a confirming new reversal color.
Is a Reversal Serious?
Very often, the binary option trader will confront a reversal in price direction
in the candlestick chart. To determine the best strategy in the context of this
kind of reversal, the question that needs to be answered is: Is it serious? This
is where three-line break charts really help. A three-line break chart will very
often not show a reversal, while a candlestick chart does. When this hap-
pens, the trader needs to question the conclusion that a reversal has occurred.
Reversals can be short-lived, especially if they are occurring on an intraday
time frame. A three-line break reversal, once detected, is not necessarily
permanent. The trader should wait for another new high or low to feel more
confident. It’s important to answer the questions:
• Is the reversal near a Fibonacci resistance line?
• Is the reversal in the direction of the larger trend?
• Is the reversal consistent with the existing ratio of the number of consecu-
tive highs to lows?
Figure 5.21 shows a scenario in which the price reversed right at a
61.8 percent Fibonacci resistance line. This is an ideal condition!
Getting familiar with three-line break charts will benefit the binary
option trader because it will provide an unambiguous tool for evaluating the
trend conditions in the market. By using three-line break charts, the trader
will accomplish four important analytical objectives:
1. Determine the strength of the trend in place.
2. Determine whether the trend is tiring.
3. Determine if a reversal has occurred and whether it is serious.
4. Select binary option strike prices.

Examples of Three-Line Break Charts for Underlying Markets
Let’s look at examples using price break with an underlying market and apply
the analysis to illustrate the kind of thinking a binary option trade involves.
A trader looking at the AUD/USD three-line break chart (Figure 5.22) sees
that the Aussie had a sequence of consecutive new-day highs, followed by a
reversal of two consecutive new lows, and then followed by another reversal
up. The trader could, looking at this pattern conclude that the pattern is very
weak bullish. Any weak news on global growth could cause a reversal and the
binary option strike price below the previous low would be a target.
Let’s look at oil. The West Texas oil three-line break chart (Figure 5.23) shows
the dramatic reversal of oil prices in February 2011 was followed by seven consec-
utive new-day highs. Then came a big reversal down. This was followed by a rever-
sal up. When a reversal is followed by another reversal, it is a very strong signal that
the resumption of the direction is strong. At the end of the chart is a big reversal
down, followed by a smaller new-day low, followed by a much smaller new-day
low. This is showing that bearish sentiment in oil was still there but getting tired.

Figure 5.24 GBP/JPY Three-Line Break Chart
The binary option trader seeing this chart could justify an at-the-money
binary option contract at 100. This would play a bounce back.
The GBP/JPY cross pair represents a very good example of a wave pat-
tern detected by the three-line break chart (Figure 5.24). This pair shows
a sequence of alternating sequences of new highs and then back to lows.
It is a great example of the power of a three-line break. Notice that when
a reversal occurs, it’s very rare to have the reversal brick followed immedi-
ately by another reversal. This provides an excellent clue as to where to locate
the binary option strike price that offers maximum support or resistance. A
buyer would locate the strike price that is below the point of the most recent
upward break at 130.00.
Key Patterns for Trading Analysis
We are not yet done with basic technical analysis. Trend analysis, and support
and resistance analysis, is an excellent foundation. However, the next build-
ing block to establish stronger trading skills is to understand the key patterns.

Figure 5.25 USD/JPY Three-Line Break Chart
Once the underlying market is chosen, it’s time to conduct a pattern
analysis. The first choice is the time interval for the charts. The four-hour
time interval represents an effective middle ground. One can gain a sense of
the big picture, as well as of the near-term changes in sentiment. For those
trading intra-day, the 30-minute time frame can be used.
While there are many patterns that are formed by price action, the ones
that all traders should know are the triangle, channel, parabolic, and Bollinger
Bands. Let’s look at some examples.
Triangles
Notice the formation of the triangle: price action starting at a wide range
between the low and high and developing incrementally smaller ranges lead-
ing to almost no difference between the low and high. The market is telling
the trader that a breakout is about to happen. Triangles come in a variety
of forms (Figure 5.26). There are ascending triangles, descending triangles,
and equilateral triangles. Triangles are classic visualizations of a cluster of
sentiment. The triangle is a compression of the range between highs and lows.

This means the battle between bullish and bearish sentiment is coming to a
breakout point. Triangles can be considered preludes to breakouts. The binary
option trader, when seeing a triangle, should locate the strike prices outside of
the triangle and play a breakout. This is usually an out-of-the-money strategy.
It can also be a deep-out-of-the-money strategy.
The triangle can be considered a barometer of emotions and indicates
that the buyers and the sellers are lacking enough energy to dominate each
other. The distance between the highs and the lows in the triangle are getting
smaller until it goes to an apex, or point. When the trader sees a triangle, it
means that there is likely to be a breakout.
The challenge for the trader is to recognize that there is a triangle forming
and then prepare to trade. The trader prepares to trade the triangles with a
breakout trade. An ascending triangle is likely to break out to the upside and
resume its trend direction that was up. A descending triangle is likely to break
out to the downside and then resume its trend direction, which was down.
Lastly, a symmetrical triangle is likely to break out in either direction.
Hesitation or Consolidation Patterns: The Triangle and the Doji
Often in viewing price movements, it looks like prices move chaotically. But
closer monitoring of price movements will often reveal patterns. One of the
most important kinds of patterns is seen after a big move. After a big move,
which is perhaps a response to news, the market goes into a period where it’s

digesting new information and is hesitating. Hesitation means that it is rang-
ing, but it also means that the market is preparing to make a decision. You know
this by noticing that the range is getting narrower. The difference between the
highs and lows becomes smaller because the buyers and sellers are giving up
and have no strong sentiment to keep the range that has existed. Hesitation is
a prelude to a shift to a new direction or a confirmation that the prior direc-
tion before the hesitation should be resumed. Several hesitation patterns have
become useful in trading. You can trade on the bounce of the price, or you can
wait for a break but wait further for the price to come back into the sideways
channel. This would provide confirmation that the pattern is still in force.
The most famous set of hesitation patterns is this class of doji candles
(Figure 5.27). These candles reflect the emotional status of indecision. The
opening and closing of a price is exactly the same. If during any period of

time the opening and closing is the same, it means the buyers and sellers are
in equilibrium and therefore the sentiment is hesitating. When a doji appears,
it doesn’t necessarily mean a reversal is coming (Figure 5.28). But what hap-
pens after the doji is important.
Channels are the signature of stability and consistency. Their wave-like visu-
als underscore the predictive cycle, like oscillations of price swings from highs
to lows (Figure 5.29). When detecting a channel, the trader is detecting the fact
that the market sentiment is continuing. The trader therefore should go with the
trend, and in-the-money strategies work with these conditions. Seeing a channel
pattern is a welcome event for traders because it provides multiple opportunities

to trade. Traders can trade in either direction as long as the price is bouncing off
the sides. We see in the following chart a representation of a downward channel.
Notice that the bounce points are in both directions. This is what makes a chan-
nel important. It allows a trader more opportunity to trade in either direction.
The parabolic pattern is a reflection of strong momentum and is powered
by crowd mania, particularly when it is forming an apex (Figure 5.30). This
is a reversal signal. However, if the parabolic is in its early stages, joining the
crowd with ATM strategies would be a ride on the momentum.
This pattern is called a parabolic because it actually follows the shape of a
curved path known as a parabolic path. What is most important about it is that
once a trader sees this pattern, it is a very strong indicator that the price is at an
extreme. The parabolic pattern occurs because there is a rush of buying or sell-
ing. This rush of buying or selling shows crowd behavior. It starts because traders
see an opportunity to make a profit, and other traders watching this start buy
because they fear they will miss the opportunity. The emotion is self-fulfilling
until the shape of the candles reaches an angle of nearly 90 degrees. This kind
of shape cannot last long and it shows the sentiment is at its maximum. When
a trader sees a parabolic pattern, it is a leading indicator that the price move will
end, pause, and often reverse. This pattern appears in all time frames.

Fibonacci resistance Lines
In her book Fibonacci Analysis, author Constance Brown said, “To under-
stand market expansion and contraction, you need to understand the differ-
ence between ratios, means, and proportion,” (Brown 2008, 16).
The trader should at all times apply the standard Fibonacci resistance tool to
the price action of the underlying market. Fibonacci ratios are a key pattern and
apply to all price patterns. These ratios have been the subject of many books and
studies. No experienced trader ignores Fibonacci lines. If you don’t know them,
it’s important to become familiar with their application. We really don’t know
why traders use Fibonacci lines, but part of the reason is that it is a self-fulfilling
prophecy. As traders deem Fibonacci lines as important, they become important.
Stops and limits and puts and calls are placed near them. They essentially work
because traders believe they work. In any case, Fibonacci lines do not predict where
the market will be. But they provide powerful markers as to where resistance and
support will be. For binary option trading, the weekly or daily, and four-hour
time price charts will be an effective time frame to use.
For binary option trading decisions, Fibonacci lines are an important tool.
When markets move in response to event risks, they often move in Fibonacci
ratios. Here are the three steps involved for using Fibonacci lines with binary
option trading:
1. Locate on the weekly or daily chart the appropriate Fibonacci line.
2. After applying the Fibonacci line, determine where the price is in
relationship to the key Fibonacci ratios.
3. Once you choose the binary option strike price you want to trade,
determine which Fibonacci line the binary option strike price is near.
The results of overlaying the Fibonacci lines on the underlying market can
be very valuable to the trader. The relationship between binary option strike
prices and Fibonacci lines are important because they can confirm whether
the intended strike price is the best one to use for a trade. If, for example, a
trader goes long a binary option strike price, but that strike price is just above
a key 61.8 Fib line, it means that there is likely to be great resistance encoun-
tered. The trade success is less likely, or requires a lot more momentum than
anticipated. Fib lines can confirm a choice of a binary option strike price. If
the spot market has just probed above a 61.8 percent Fib line and the trade
wants to go with an in-the-money strategy, choosing the strike price right
below the fib line makes sense.
The most important Fibonacci ratios used in trading are 38.2 percent,
50 percent, and 61.8 percent. Fibonacci resistance lines on the day chart are the

most important. Many underlying markets often have prices probing near the key
day fi b lines. EUR/USD provides such an example. First we locate the EUR/USD
chart and notice a signifi cant high was formed about May 9. Th e price action fol-
lowed with a decline and formed a low. Th e Fibonacci tool connects the high to
the low and generates the Fibonacci ratios. At the same time, viewing the EUR/
USD weekly binary option strike prices (Table 5.1 ) showed that the 1.4675 strike
price was the closest to the actual 61.8 percent Fib line, which was at 1.4572
(Figure 5.31 ). Th is is almost an exact overlay of a key Fibonacci line and a binary
option strike price. Th e result is a confl uence of confi rmation that a trader loves
to see from more than one technical condition. Th e trader looking to go long the
EUR/USD would realize that a strong move was necessary to break through.
TIP
Th e binary option trade will face more resistance than usual when a strike price
is near a key Fibonacci price point. It is a good idea to always check for the pres-
ence of Fibonacci patterns.
Th is chapter has shown that a basic form of technical analysis for the binary
option trader starts when the trader identifi es patterns in the price action. Th ose
patterns refl ect the shape of market sentiment and the stability of the pattern
is directly related to the stability of the sentiment. Since binary option trading
is focused on direction, the trader should apply pattern analysis, and initially
focus on trend analysis, to increase confi dence about the trading decision he or
she is about to make and improve the probability of profi table results.

Advanced Technical
Analysis: Volatility Tools
Beyond basic technical analysis of chart trend direction and chart patterns,
there remains one more significant category of technical analysis that can give
binary option traders an edge. It is the category of volatility tools. There are
many of them. Let’s take a closer look.
Defining Volatility
Let’s first clarify what volatility is before delving into its technical aspects for
trading. Simply put, if prices stayed stable and within a small range over any
period of time, then volatility would be minimal. Volatility is a measure of
the swings in price action and the rate of change of those swings. The trader
detects volatility by seeing the market become increasingly anxious. Market
anxiety can be observed first in headlines as well as the emergence of wider
price swings. This is in contrast to the experience of a calm market with very
little price action. Ignoring the volatility conditions of the underlying market
is a recipe for misapplying binary option strategies. High volatility conditions,
if ignored, will lead to applying inappropriate trading strategies. High volatil-
ity conditions are associated with larger swings in prices and therefore wider
ranges. These conditions are excellent for successful application of out-of-the-
money (OTM) and deep-out-of-the-money (DOTM) trades. They are more
likely to work out when volatility is higher because price swings are more
likely. However, extremely high volatility conditions are often used by traders
as reversal signals. The reasoning is that extreme volatility reflects transient

conditions and the underlying market will return to average ranges of volatility.
Th is is also known as regression to the mean. In contrast, low volatility condi-
tions refl ect a market that is clustered and is often a prelude to a breakout.
Th ere are many technical analysis tools available to the trader to monitor vola-
tility conditions. Let’s review some basic ones that ought to be applied.
bollinger bands
Bollinger Bands are a good fi rst approach to mapping price volatility. Th ey
enable every trader to view volatility conditions. Bollinger Band charts have
three parts. Th e fi rst part is a curved line in the middle. Th is is a moving average
line. Th e second part is a l ower band , and the third part is an u pper band . Th e
bands are called Bollinger Bands because John Bollinger devised them. Th e
upper and lower Bollinger Bands are a statistical curve that is placed around
the price. In other words, they represent a special kind of boundary. Th e
upper and lower bands actually represent a standard deviation around a mov-
ing average. Th e concept of standard deviation is a statistical concept used to
summarize data. It’s seen in most applications as a bell curve. Let’s see how it
can be applied to the world of trading.
A common setting of the bands is (20, 2). Th is means that the moving
average in the middle of the bands is a 20-period moving average. It also means
that the upper and lower bands are two standard deviations from the moving
average. Th is setting translates, in simpler terms, that the price is 96 percent of
the time between the two bands! If the setting was (20, 3) the Bollinger Band
chart would still have a 20-period moving average in the middle, but the upper
and lower band would be three standard deviations, or 99 percent from the
middle. Th e default setting used by traders is accepted as (20, 2).

Bollinger Bands are a popular indicator used in many markets. They
enable the trader to confirm whether the price is at an upper range or
resistance, and whether the price is at a lower range or support. When
prices are near Bollinger Bands, they have a strong probability of pausing
in their direction and reversing. This has important implications to the
binary option trader because the binary option strike price may be located
above, or below one of the bands. Or the binary option strike price might
be right in the middle of the band. The trader needs to know where the
binary option strike price is in relationship to the band to assess properly
the degree of likely resistance or support that will be encountered as time
moves forward.
Interpreting Bollinger Bands
Interpreting the Bollinger Band patterns (Figure 6.1) is straightforward and
can be explained as a simple three-step process:
1. Notice the shape of the band.
The bands can be narrow or wide. If the band is narrow, it means that
the market is becoming undecided as to which direction to go. A narrow
band becomes narrow as the range between support and resistance
decreases. A band becomes wider as the range becomes wider.
2. Notice the direction of the bands.
The band can be sideways, tilted up, or tilted down. If it is a sideways
band and looks quite level, this means that the trend direction is in a
pause before it resumes going up or down. If the bands are tilted up, this
means that the trend is upward. If the bands are titled down, it means
the trend is downward.
3. Notice the location of the price.
The price (candles or bars) are often right on the band. If there are
several candles in a row on an upper or lower band, it indicates that the
market is sticky and is not ready yet to decide which way to go.
Do’s and Don’ts
When noticing a narrow band, try to avoid trading it because it can suddenly
move against you. It’s actually a very good precondition for a breakout binary
option trade. When the price has moved above the Bollinger Band, watch if
it tries to come back below the band; if it does, it is an indication of a reversal
down. When the price has moved below the Bollinger Band, watch if it tries

to come back above it; if it doesn’t, it is an indication of a reversal back up.
Don’t assume that if a price is at a Bollinger Band, it will stop there. It can
stay at the band for a long time.
Bollinger Bands also provide a standard and accepted quick look at
volatility. The wider the bands are, the greater the range between support
and resistance. When Bollinger Bands become narrow, it is a signal of break-
out potential. When Bollinger Bands are very wide, they reflect increased
volatility conditions. The Bollinger Band has a standard setting of (20, 2).
The number 20 represents the simple moving average, and the number 2
represents the standard deviation around the moving average. This means
that the price is 96 percent of the time between the upper and lower levels.
A price probing or breaking an upper or lower band signals a big change in
volatility. It means the trader should be much attuned to what is going on.
The price is there for a reason, and assumptions that it will reverse have to
be confirmed.
An additional technique useful to traders is to put on an extra outer band
at a setting of (13, 2.618). This additional setting represents 13 periods as the

moving average and a 2.618 standard deviation. This means that the upper
and lower bands are capturing 99 percent of the move. A price that has gone
through the standard band (20, 2) and also the outer band of (13, 2.618) is at
very high levels of extreme value. This is often associated with very high levels
of volatility and therefore is a reversal signal.
Using Bands with Support and Resistance Lines
In our introductory section, we described the basic definition of Bollinger
Bands. This section will help you identify ways to combine Bollinger Bands
with other technical analysis tools to make them even more effective.
The first tool that should be combined with a Bollinger Band is a sup-
port and resistance line. In many ways, a Bollinger Band acts as a kind of
resistance, or support line. By its very nature, the bands are providing a
boundary for the price. It is a statistical boundary and the bands are not
actual price support or resistance lines. A price support and resistance line
connects lows or highs of the prices in a selected time interval. When you
combine Bollinger Bands and support and resistance lines, the effect can
be much greater information about how strong the support or resistance
is. It is always a good idea to use both Bollinger Bands and support and
resistance lines.
We see that the upper Bollinger Band is coinciding almost exactly with
the resistance line (Figure 6.2). When this happens the trader is more confi-
dent that there is serious and strong resistance in this area. It’s important to
notice that the price highs are able to go above the upper Bollinger Band. This
shows that the Bollinger Bands are really a zone and should not be interpreted
as a solid resistance or support area. It’s important to observe what the price
is doing after it penetrates the Bollinger Band. Is it returning back into the
band? When this happens, it is a strong reversal condition.
Using Bands with Trend Lines
Another useful approach is to combine Bollinger Bands with trend lines. This
combination works very well together (Figure 6.3).
First, we can notice that the band is fairly sideways and wide in shape.
This provides more opportunity for the price to bounce around. In fact, we
can see that the price came to the bottom of the bands and started turning
up. It created an outer trend and then quickly shifted inward and it created
an inner trend line and then another inner trend line. This showed a great
deal of momentum. By drawing the inner trend lines, the trader can see that

the price is very bullish. In fact, the price went up to the top of the Bollinger
Band. When the price is at an upper band, it is a clue that it may turn around.
In this situation, the trader should wait until the price goes back and breaks
the trend line to confirm a selling condition!
Let’s examine a situation in which the price is entering a downward trend
and the candles are sliding down the lower Bollinger Band (Figure 6.4). This
kind of pattern is seen often. The price after going up then breaks its uptrend.
At that point, it is a sell signal. Another sell point occurs when the price on
its way down hesitates, forms a doji, and then breaks down. This is a key sell
point because it shows a failure to go up.

The question will arise: What are indications that a bounce back up is
likely? If the price is in a downtrend line and it breaks that line, then the
situation can be considered a move toward the other side. By using trend
lines in combination with Bollinger Bands, the ability to locate an entry
point is greatly enhanced. If the Bollinger Band is sideways and flat, it really
is the best shape for binary option traders because it’s the condition for a
breakout trade.

Adding Another Band with a Different Setting
To further advance your knowledge and use of Bollinger Bands, we introduce
here the addition of a second band setting. The first setting is a standard,
or default, setting of 20, 2. This, as you know, means, 20 periods, and two



==================================================
                     PAGE 107

Advanced Technical Analysis: Volatility Tools 105
standard deviations. It captures between the two bands 96 percent of the
prices. What happens if we add another band with a different setting? Another
band might help us understand better what is happening with the first band!
A second band setting suggested here is known as the extended Bollinger
Band (EBB). Its setting is (13, 2.618). This means the moving average is 13
periods and the standard deviation is nearly at 3 or 99 percent. The 2.618 is
really a Fibonacci extension number.
Let’s examine what it means for the trader to put on another Bollinger
Band with the settings of 13, 2.618 (Figure 6.5). First, it means that the
moving average, or the middle line of the Bollinger Band, is a shorter time
line. Contrast this with the 20-period time line. This provides the trader a
view that is nearer to the recent action. But the adjustment of the setting
to 2.618 standard deviations means that the band widens to capture nearly
99 percent of the action. If we put these two settings together, we have two
upper bands and two lower bands! The result is four bands. The trader should
particularly focus on where the price is. If the price is beyond the inner band,
which is usually the standard band setting of 20, 2, it means the price is at
an extreme. But the trader using an extended Bollinger Band can see that it
would be very extreme only if it went to touch or go beyond the outer band
of 13, 2.618. The addition of an extended Bollinger Band is very effective in
alerting the trader to a buy or sell signal. In Figure 6.5 we see that the price hit
a double bottom that was sitting right on both lower bands. That represents
very strong support.
Let’s consider how the EBB generates price signals. For a sell signal situ-
ation, the concept is simply that if the price goes to the EBB, the trader has
an extreme situation and can consider it to be a strong predictor of a reversal.
If the price goes beyond the EBB and then returns below it, this is a strong
sell signal.
A buy signal is straightforward. If the price goes beyond the bottom EBB
and then returns above it, it is a strong buy signal!
We can clearly see in Figure 6.5 that when the price went down to the
lower bands, a candle going back up followed it. This showed that the mood
of the market was more bullish. Without the EBB, the trader wouldn’t have
an ability to confirm if the price is about to reverse.
Example of Step-by-Step Analysis
Let’s pause and reflect on the technical analysis process so far, evolving toward
placing a binary option trade (Figure 6.6). The flow of analysis starts with an ini-
tial technical scan of fundamental market conditions. A second phase consists

of a thorough checking and ranking of trend conditions. The analytical pro-
cess continues by checking the presence of sideways, or ranging, markets. At
this point, a close look at chart patterns is in order. Some underlying markets
look better than others and will appeal to the trader. Once you select the
underlying market(s) to trade, the challenge is to find the binary option strike
price that matches the pattern. Then place your trade. Let’s explore these steps
with more scrutiny.
Step 1: Scan the Fundamental Market Conditions
The initial technical analysis scanning process starts with a review of the most
important market complexes. They include, but are not limited to the USDX,
gold, oil, the Shanghai Index, SPX, and so on.
The goal of the scan is to evaluate the technical conditions in these
important markets. The conditions include, but are not limited to trends,
momentum, resistance, support, and volatility.
While there isn’t one single method to conduct the technical scan, the
initial scan should include multiple time frames. Multiple time frames need
to be reviewed from the weekly and daily to the four-hour patterns to gain a
sense about any changes in the mood of the market. The four-hour pattern
provides a good interim time period. It reflects most recent market reactions,
and allows the trader to still review the price action over several days. The key
point here is to never review only one time frame. Upon performing the scans,
ask yourself what is interesting that strikes you. Interesting patterns noticed
by the trader are very important. This is also known as the blink effect. It
means one can recognize binary trading opportunities within seconds!

==================================================

108 Trading Binary Options
Step 2: Check and Rank Trend Conditions
The focus of analysis here is on ranking the trend conditions. Trends can be
just starting, strong, and stable. Of course, they can also begin to show weak-
ening. These conditions, once detected, will help the trader match the binary
option strategy that best fits the changing trend conditions.
As noted earlier, a very good charting tool for assessing trend conditions
is the three-line break chart. This charting focuses exclusively on detecting the
strength of the trend. In any case, no matter which charts you are using, rank-
ing the trend conditions is a useful technique. Besides using three-line break
charts, a commonly accepted measure of trend strength is the 50-day moving
average. If the underlying market is probing the 50-day moving average, it
is a signal of a change in the trend. Also, for each underlying market, rank
the trend for the weekly, daily, and four-hour chart. A rank of one means the
trend has just begun after reversing the previous trend. A rank of two means
it’s into the beginning of a new trend. A rank of three means it’s a stable trend
(usually approaching a 37 to 45 degree angle). A rank of four means it’s accel-
erating; five means it’s almost parabolic.
Step 3: Check If a Sideways Ranging Market Exists
If a market is not trending, it must be in a range. Markets in a range pro-
vide excellent binary trading opportunities. So, just as it was important
to rank the trending markets, it’s important to rank those markets that
are ranging. Ask yourself: Have there been multiple tests of resistance or
support?
Is there a breakout pattern forming?
Step 4: Choose Underlying Markets to Trade
While there are more than 20 underlying markets to choose, the simple fact
is that most people should start with trading only a handful. The choice
of what to trade should be based on conclusions derived from Step 1 to
Step 3.
Step 5: Evaluate Volatility Conditions
Once you choose the underlying market to trade, it’s important to look at the
volatility conditions. Many beginning traders ignore this phase. We have not
covered this step, so let’s review what is involved.

These five basic steps provide a firm foundation for assessing trading
conditions. The trader should always be sure that she has participated in each
step. The effect of using each step is that it will minimize misunderstanding
market conditions.
ViX: The Fear index
In addition to Bollinger Bands, another tool that binary option traders should
know about and use is the VIX Index. The words fear and risk aversion reflect
bearish sentiment. But even more importantly, they are evidence of a herding
behavior. The crowd has joined the sentiment wave of fear. It’s a powerful
event and moves markets and creates trading opportunities.
Here is what the CBOE says about VIX:
The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) is a key measure of market expec-
tations of near-term volatility conveyed by S&P 500 stock index op-
tion prices. Since its introduction in 1993, VIX has been considered
by many to be the world’s premier barometer of investor sentiment
and market volatility.
What is important about the VIX is its use as a contrarian indicator for
the S&P 500. The inverse correlation often approaches 90 percent (Table 6.1).
The S&P 500 as an underlying market is one of the most important as it
affects many other markets. Trading the S&P 500 depends not only on basic
charting analysis, it requires tracking emotions and the mood of the market.
So if a binary option trader wants to select a direction for trading the
S&P, it’s a very good idea to first check volatility. Historically, the inverse
correlation relationship between the VIX and S&P 500 has been quite high,
reaching to over 85 percent in the opposite direction (Figure 6.8). As with
other instruments, there is never a linear correlation. There are times when
the VIX and the S&P 500 can move together.

==================================================

110 Trading Binary Options
Figure 6.8 VIX Movements and the S&P 500
How should the VIX relationship to the S&P 500 be used? Its most
important use is confirming whether extreme conditions are in place in the
market. If the VIX is rising fast, the S&P 500 is likely falling fast. These
are transient conditions, and the binary option trader, who is looking for a
directional bet for a few days, has to be careful. But the VIX isn’t only for
the S&P 500. Since its introduction, there are a large number of volatil-
ity indexes for other underlying markets that provide indicators of whether
those markets are at low or high extremes in volatility. For example, there is
a VIX for the Brent Crude oil market, which is also contrarian. Its symbol is
OVX. We can see that when the OVX hit highs, it was a leading indicator of
a decline in crude (Figure 6.9). West Texas oil has its own volatility index—
OIV (Figure 6.10). Gold spot has a volatility index version with the symbol
GVZ. Binary option traders who trade gold directions use it to see volatility
conditions (Figure 6.11). Silver, like gold has its own volatility index with the
symbol VXSLV (Figure 6.12).
The FTSE index provides an excellent example of the contrarian relation-
ship between extremes in VIX and direction. The symbol VFTSE is the VIX
for the FTSE (Figure 6.13). The DAX30 has a VIX counterpart in the symbol
VDAX (Figure 6.14). The key volatility indexes associated with the binary
option underlying markets are important to follow. They will enable the

trader to spot opportunities and extremes in markets otherwise difficult to
detect. Use the different VIXs as a barometer of market sentiment. It doesn’t
matter if there is no underlying binary option market to trade. They do help.
For example, the Hang Seng index has its own VIX (CHIX) and it provides
an ability to monitor sentiment on the Chinese markets (Figure 6.15). More
volatility indexes in the future are likely to be developed. A good idea is to
always inquire whether a key index has its own VIX version.

The overall value of knowing the volatility of the underlying markets is to
use it as a confirming indicator of breakout conditions. Without any volatil-
ity, there would be little information about the conditions of market opinion.
Extremes in volatility can be considered valuable information events as well
as contrarian signals that the market direction is about to reverse. While this

relationship is never perfect, it acts as a good technical barometer of sentiment
conditions. An additional value of watching several global volatility indexes
is to see which are diverging. While the foreign markets often move in coin-
cidence with each other, they may not react with the same magnitude to an
event. There will be markets with relatively lower volatility compared to others.
This is particularly important in trading the binary option contracts for the
equity indexes (see Table 6.2).

Option Volatility and Sentiment: Put/Call ratios
A long established class of volatility indicators is known as the put/call ratio.
It is a classic sentiment indicator. Th e concept is that when traders are bear-
ish, they buy puts. When they are bullish about direction, they buy calls. As a
result, extremes in sentiment can be detected. How does a trader know when
the sentiment is skewed in favor of puts or calls? Th ere are several ways of
measuring sentiment extremes. First, when the sentiment is predominantly
bearish, there is naturally more contract volume of puts than that of calls. Th e
result is known as the p ut/call ratio . Th is is the volume of put options/volume
of call options. Once again, the concept of volatility or extreme variation in
a pattern comes into play. Th e key step in relationship to put/call ratios is to
identify when these ratios are at extremes. Put/call premium ratios are reliable
gauges of the skew of opinion.
A second, valuable form of the put/call ratio is the comparison of the
implied volatility of the puts divided by the implied volatility of the calls. Th e
reasoning is: if buying an at-the-money put is more expensive than an at-the-
money call, the market is more bearish.
Th e binary option trader can use a variety of sources to locate put/call
ratios for a particular underlying market. One common source is the futures
market. Even if you are not trading futures contracts, the value of the put/
call information is worthy of review and is available by viewing the futures
options contracts at the CME, CBOT, NYMEX, and other futures trading
exchanges. A quick guide to whether fear or greed is dominant in the market
can be seen at www.money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed.
Th eir Fear and Greed index monitors seven factors: put/call ratio,
VIX, the McClellan Volume Summation Index, stock price strength, haven
demand, market momentum, and junk bond demand.
Sector Put/Call Ratios
Just like the case with the VIX, for every underlying market off ering binary
options, there is also a corresponding s ector index , or group of funds that

provide option data on the sentiment regarding that market. This is also
important to review because the sentiment on an underlying market may be
related, or not, to the overall market it is a part of. Once an underlying market
is being considered for trading the binaries, an important additional step in
shaping the directional trade is to check on the put/call ratios of the sector.
How can this be done? To be able to do this, the trader can locate exchange
traded funds (ETFs) that offer options on them and then determine the asso-
ciated put/call volume. The CBOE is a great site for locating this information.
Let’s look at some examples of using ETFs and the put/call ratio in pre-
paring to trade gold binaries. One can look at GLD, a gold ETF, and at the
same time check the put/call ratio. During the period shown in Figure 6.16,
gold had reached new highs and sold off only to recover again. The put/call
ratio for gold on 0.9947 shows a neutral mood for the market and is leaning
neither bullish nor bearish. The binary option trader has to use this sentiment
information to confirm which way he wants to trade.
Similarly, if a trader was looking to put on binary options on the oil mar-
ket, USO, an ETF on oil provides option sentiment data to use (Figure 6.17).
In addition to scanning the USO chart, the put/call ratio provides a gauge
on the mood of traders on this market. Oil had reached highs because of

Middle East turbulence, and then sold off. The chart looks like a sideways
action. Looking at the put/call ratio, the trader finds a 1.0102 ratio, indicat-
ing slightly bearish sentiment.
There should be no doubt that a greater insight into the sentiment of the
market is gained by examining options on the ETF.
Volatility Smiles
When markets are leaning bullish or bearish, the extent of the shift in senti-
ment to one side may be predictive of price action that follows in the days
ahead. Option traders try to detect the strength of bearish and bullish senti-
ment by looking at volatility smiles. The volatility smile is simply a graphic
of the volatility surface. It reflects an imbalance in the implied volatilities of
an option at the same strike price. Either the implied volatility of puts at the
same strike price is greater than the implied volatility of calls at that strike
price or vice-versa. If the market crowd were neutral in regard to direction,
there would be no skew. It would be a perfect smile! But that hardly ever
occurs. The more experienced binary option traders may want to use volatility

smiles to see which way the market is leaning. It provides more evidence, not
necessarily where the market will go, but where the opinion pool is clustering.
When the volatility smile is extremely skewed to puts or calls, it can be
interpreted as confirming a strategy to follow the skew. Alternatively, it can
also be interpreted as representing an exaggerated condition and a reversal is
coming. On its own, a volatility smile cannot be used as the only source of
a confirmation on direction. It’s also important to locate the volatility smile
for weekly or one-month durations as its relevance to binary option decisions
declines when the smiles are using longer-term time frames.
An effective way to apply volatility smiles to binary option trading is to
evaluate the presence of a smile or a skew as a way of confirming the mood of
the market. Then compare the results of the review with your own opinion.
Is your binary option bet going with the skew or betting that it will reverse?
Let’s look at a snapshot of some volatility smiles and relate them to the
mood of the market at that time.
The EUR/USD on May 30 showed a volatility smile that is leaning to
the put side. This is very bearish. In fact, Figure 6.18 shows that the one-week
smile is much more bearish than the one-month smile, because the implied
volatility curve is shifted upward.

The AUD/USD pair shows a very steep bias to puts. This would make a
binary trader think twice about going long the AUD/USD. An appropriate
strategy when the volatility smile is skewed so far is to go with the crowd with
a deep-in-the-money strategy (Figure 6.19).
The GBP/USD volatility smile also shows, compared to the AUD/USD,
a steeper lean to the put side (Figure 6.20). The USD/CHF volatility smile
here is interesting because it shows, in contrast to the EUR/USD (Figure
6.18), a bit more of a sentiment for calls, but still very bearish (Figure 6.21).
The USD/CAD pair is the only one of the majors that has a smile that is
favoring the call side, showing a very strong bias for a stronger dollar (Figure
6.22). Traders looking for a stronger Canadian dollar because of stronger oil
would think twice about it.
The USD/JPY volatility smile was almost the only one close to being
balanced and showing a normal smile (Figure 6.23). This correlates with a
sideways action and, in fact, a normal smile supports a breakout strategy since
the market is not showing any domination regarding direction.
Our last volatility smile is the GBP/JPY cross pair. We see a very strong
preference for a weakening of this pair. Once again seeing this, the choice
facing the trading is to either be contrarian and go the other way, or join the
crowd (Figure 6.24).

The difficulty with volatility smiles is that it takes special software offered
by third parties to generate the visuals. They are, however, available for the
more sophisticated trader through special software and applications. Also,
the more quant-oriented traders can generate their own volatility smiles from
grabbing option data from the web. In any case, traders who access volatility
smiles will find it a useful tool to gain an edge.
Fear of recession
The emergence out of the financial collapse of 2008 occurred in 2015 as
the United States fully recovered in its financial condition. The increase in
interest rates on December 16 signaled a shift in the confidence about the
U.S. economy. The statement of the FOMC on December 16 is perhaps
one of the most important statements that traders should study. (See the
full statement in Chapter 4). In reading it, the Federal Reserve is signaling
what it will look at in deciding future interest rate increases. A focus on
inflation and whether it will be near 2 percent is one important parameter.
The decision to raise rates, however, introduces a new fear: fear of a recession.
If the U.S. economic recovery weakens or stalls, it will generate a fear of
recession and increased volatility in the U.S. dollar, gold, and related markets.
The trader could have an edge if they understand and monitor that one of
the indicators of a recession will be the shape of the yield curve. An inverse
yield curve is accepted as a strong indicator of a recession (Estrella and Tru-
bin 2006). When the yield curve inverts, it is generally accepted as a predictor

of a coming recession. An inverted yield curve is the difference (spread)
between the 10-year Treasury note and the three-month Treasury bill. We can
see in Table 6.3 that the probability of a recession is greater than 50 percent
when the spread gets above –1.00.
The spread as of December 17, the day after the Federal Reserve raised
rates by 25 basis points was 1.985. This value is a result of the calculation:
U.S. Treasury 10-Year Bonds (2.2395) – (U.S. Treasury Three-Month Bill
(0.2545.) = 1.985.
It is very far away from the negative value necessary to signal a recession.
Nevertheless, it’s a good idea for the trader to keep track of this relationship
from time to time.
A sentiment-based component for predicting a recession that should be used
is the frequency of the word “recession” mentioned in Google search engines. If
the frequency increases, it is a clue that there is increased concern about it.

Tracking Money Supply as an indicator of growth
The fear of a recession in the United States is likely to be linked to a change
in the money supply. If the money supply is insufficient, then the economy
is likely to not have the liquidity necessary to stimulate growth. After the
2008 crisis, banks reduced their lending, which froze the economy. The Great
Recession that followed the 2008 collapse was very long substantially because
of the lack of money growth. The recession officially began in December
2007 and ended in June 2009. Roughly 80 percent of the money supply is
determined by banks providing credit and loans and 20 percent is provided
by the United States government. The trader now has the benefit of access to
good data on the money supply. It is published by the Center for Financial
Stability (www.centeroffinancialstablity). The trader should look at the mea-
sure called CFS Divisia M4, “which is the broadest and most important mea-
sure of money.” M4 includes notes and coins and bank accounts. It is not a
coincidence that as this broad measure of money supply increases, the finan-
cial condition of the economy also increases. It is a good idea to keep track of
this important M4 measure.

In this chapter, we’ve seen how to use several advanced technical analysis
tools, including Bollinger Bands, the VIX Index, put/call ratios, and volatil-
ity smiles. We also reviewed how to track an emerging fear of recession using
U.S. Treasury data. Lastly, we saw how cycle indicators can also work in the
trader’s favor. Th ese tools, combined with those discussed in the basic techni-
cal analysis chapter, form a solid foundation for understanding what it takes
to trade binary options successfully.

Binary Option Trading
Strategies
This chapter provides a review and sampling with real-world conditions in
which basic binary option trading strategies combine and build upon funda-
mental, technical, and sentiment analyses. These examples act as case studies
for learning how markets react to different events. Try to compare the trad-
ing strategies and actions reviewed here with your own approach to market
conditions described. As always, once an underlying market is selected, the
challenge is to determine the most highly probable winning binary strategy
to apply. This chapter will help you meet that challenge. We first review core
strategies and then explore trading examples.
The Core Strategies
There are many strategy variations, but there are basically seven major binary
option trading strategies that provide the set of options to respond to most
global market-related events.
1. In-the-money (ITM)
2. Deep-in-the-money (DITM)
3. At-the-money (ATM)
4. Out-of-the-money (OTM)
5. Deep-out-of-the-money (DOOM)
6. Range trades
7. Breakout trades

==================================================

128 Trading Binary Options
In no uncertain terms, every trader who is considering binary option
trading needs to understand and master these strategies and determine when
they apply. We explore them in a variety of examples in this chapter.
In-the-Money or Deep-in-the-Money
Consider the scenario of a trader recognizing a trending market condition.
What strategy works in this case? If the trend is strong and the headlines
seem to be screaming at you, one can sense momentum in the markets. Such
conditions provide confirmation for an in-the-money strategy, which is a
trend-following approach. After scanning the headlines, check if the trend
strength continues. A good gauge is to see if the trend line is approaching a
37- to 45-degree angle, or whether the price just broke through its 50-day
moving average. Ask yourself: Is the trend being confirmed by a sequence of
new daily highs or new daily lows? It is a good idea to use price break charts
to quickly visualize trend strength. If the answer is confirming a bull or bear
trending condition, a DITM trade makes a lot of sense. Such a strategy reflects
confidence that the trend direction will continue to be strong. While the term
deep-in-the-money is very subjective, it is reasonable to consider trades that
risk $75–$85 to be deep-in-the-money. They are priced high by the market
because the expected probability that they will settle as a winner is high. The
trader putting on a DITM is following or joining the crowd. If it is a bullish
strategy (Figure 7.1), the binary strike price is priced near 80 ask. If it is a
bear strategy, it is selling and receiving the bid price, which is a resistance leg
above the spot price with an ask price in the range of 20 to 14 (Figure 7.2).
The trader should note that the distance of the binary strike price from the
spot price in binaries that are priced at 75 to 85 are often near 2 percent. That
means it takes a big market move to lose those positions.

At-the-Money or Near-the-Money
For market conditions that point to the weakening of a trend and a possible
momentum move, follow an at-the-money (ATM) strategy. An ATM contract
is priced around $45 to $55 and this reflects a bit more market uncertainty.
But if the ATM is riding with the trend direction, it is a safer play than a
similarly priced binary option contract that is embedded in a sideways action.
It also provides a potential return of almost 100 percent if it is settled in-the-
money by Friday expiration. An at- or near-the-money binary option play
can also be in response to a sideways pattern if the price is still hovering near
its support or resistance level. Think of at-the-money as a bet on a bounce.
It works if the market has enough energy in it to move the price out of its
pattern. Binary option trades that offer higher or lower trading decisions only
are in fact at-the-money trades.
Out-of-the-Money and Deep-Out-of-the Money
At the other extreme of strategies for playing the trend is an out-of-the-money
(OTM) trade. An OTM trade of a trending underlying market is a bet that
the trend will not only continue but will be able to sharply rise. A deep-out-
of-the-money (DOOM) binary play is a long shot and an anticipation trade
(Figure 7.3). The trader is going for a high-roller return and is willing to take
the risk. Let’s look at some real-time examples of strategic and tactical think-
ing in shaping the binary option trading strategy.

The range trade has as a distinctive feature one in which the trade is immedi-
ately half correct. In a range trade, one cannot be wrong on both strike prices.
The range trade has as its feature selling an upper resistance strike price, and
buying a lower support strike price (Figure 7.4). The wider the range, the more
probable the price will stay within the range. The risk of the range trade is
half the sum of the risks of both legs. The reward of the range trade is that the
trader keeps the amount he sold for at the bid price, and wins 100-ask price.

Binary Option Trading Strategies 131
Breakout Trades
The breakout trade is the inverse of the range trade. The trader selects a range, an
upper and lower strike price, and bets that the price will settle outside the range.
It doesn’t matter whether the price breaks through the upper resistance strike
price or the lower resistance strike price. The reward or profit will be the same.
The breakout trade is essentially a play on volatility (Figure 7.5). The
trader isn’t betting on direction. She is simply anticipating that the move will
be big enough to break through the selected range.
The breakout trade is ideal for trading key economic data releases such as
the NFP report because these releases move the markets.
It takes time to become adept at matching price patterns with the best
binary strategy. Figure 7.6 is a quick guide for finding the binary strategy
most appropriate to the identified market condition.
World events and Binary Trades
Applying binary option strategies to real market conditions is where the trader
will gain experience and sharpen his or her skills. The beauty of weekly binary
option trading is that at the start of every week, the trader has the oppor-
tunity to observe how the market has reset its balance of fears and detect
whether there have been any shifts in sentiment. The binary trader is in effect
a trader of world events. The following examples will help reinforce your
understanding of binary trading.

Gold as a Fundamental and Fear Play
Gold offers examples of how two fundamental forces set the stage for binary
option trading. The first force is gold fear of inflation, and the second force
is gold as a haven basket in times of crisis. Over the years, many gold price
patterns reflect these two forces. Let’s take a closer look.
The week of April 18, 2011, is our first case. During that week, gold
price action patterns presented a mixed binary option trading opportunity
as shown in Figure 7.7. The debt crisis at that time in Europe also became
reflected in the difference between the yields of the German versus the Greek
bonds (see Figure 7.8).

The week began with a big bang. The Standard & Poor’s rating agency
announced a lowering of the ratings on the U.S. bonds. The announcement
triggered a market selloff in the equity markets and increased bullish sentiment
on gold. A Bloomberg.com headline and article reflected what happened:

Stocks Sink on U.S. Credit Outlook as Euro Falls on Debt Crises
U.S. stocks sank the most in a month, oil slid and gold rose to
a record after Standard & Poor’s cut the American credit outlook
to negative and concern about Europe’s debt crises grew. Greek
two-year bond yields surged to 20 percent for the first time since
at least 1998 and the S&P 500 tumbled 1.1 percent to 1,305.14 at
4 p.m. in New York, its worst drop since March 16, and the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index slid 1.7 percent. Ten-year Treasury notes gained,
sending yields down four basis points to 3.37 percent, amid specu-
lation S&P’s move will motivate lawmakers to pass a budget that
requires less borrowing. The euro lost 1.4 percent to $1.4234 and
Portuguese debt-insurance costs reached a record. The S&P GSCI
index of commodities slid 1.2 percent as oil sank.
Based on these events, the following real-time binary option trading alert
was sent out in Agora Financial’s Strategic Currency Trading newsletter, on
Monday, April 18:
Action Alert: Playing Market Fears for a Chance at 72 Percent Gains
or More
This morning, there is a mix of fears. Fear of inflation, fear of
a China slowdown, fear of Eurozone financial instability centered
around Greece. This translates into risk aversion—and the underlying
market benefiting greatly from this sentiment is GOLD. June Comex
Gold is near historic highs, and the fears that are driving these highs are
not likely to abate. So the first play this week is ride the wave and BUY
a gold binary option. In particular, I’m looking at the 1487.5 binary.
With the gold spot market at 1484, it doesn’t have to go much further
to get us more than double-digit returns! [See Figure 7.7.]
Trade Action to Take: Buy a Nadex weekly gold 1487.5 binary
at market.
Ordinarily, weekly gold binaries expire on Friday at 1:30 p.m. But
Nadex is closed this Friday. So with the 1487.5 strike price virtually at
the money, we have the ability to get a 72 percent net return in four
days! But if you have less risk appetite but still want to ride the gold
sentiment, you can buy a binary with a 1467.5 strike. This play is deep-
in-the-money—meaning gold would have to go $17 below current spot
for this binary option play to be wrong. Of course, it costs more with the
current ask near $85. This is because the market has an 85 percent expec-
tation of success. So this is not a high-roller play, but more of a portfolio
strategy approach. After all, a 15 percent return in four days isn’t bad!



==================================================
                     PAGE 137                     
==================================================

Binary Option Trading Strategies 135
Feeling bolder? Take a binary with a higher strike price—the 1497.5. At a
current offer of $46, you have a chance to more than double your money!
Optional Trade Action to Take: Conservative traders can buy a
Nadex weekly gold 1467.5 binary at market. More speculative trad-
ers can buy the Nadex weekly 1497.5 binary.
This alert employed a simple strategy of joining the gold crowd on
Monday morning. There are several strategies placed in motion. This first
is a deep-in-the-money play at 1467.5, an ATM at 1487.5, and an OTM at
1497.5; all rode the bullish wave and settle in-the-money, paying out $100
per unit on costs of $46 and $85. These trades had a potential total return
near 17 percent and 117 percent. Adding a deeper out-of-the-money trade
would, of course, result in an even greater return. The Nadex offer on $1507.5
gold was $34 on Monday. The collective wisdom of the crowd thought that
there was only a 34 percent probability that gold underlying would be above
that level by Friday (Table 7.1). They turned out to be very wrong!
While most traders focus on the technical market conditions at the
moment of the trade, understanding binary option trading from a technical
level is really not enough. The crucial factor is the mind-set of the trader. This
is when emotional, as well as visual, intelligence comes into play. Putting on
a binary option trade is more than implementing a technical strategy. The
trade carries with it the trader’s subjective interpretation of the strength of
the sentiment. That is often an intuitive feeling. In our gold example, that
morning’s sudden selloff of gold represented something unexpected, and at
the same time, it was familiar. The familiar part was the reaction process of
the market. If you play a sudden event, and the move is in response to serious
new information, the market will react. But the experienced trader will not
always expect a selloff. If the news was so strong, it creates new conditions,
and therefore, the price is likely not to reverse that quickly.

Of course, gold became very bearish as quantitative easing ended and
U.S. interest rates increased on December 16, 2015. Gold bulls will have
to wait for periods of a slowdown in the U.S. economy. The Paris terrorist
attacks of November 14 provided another classical example of gold triggering
a temporary haven.
Gold rose, in a haven response as markets opened the following Monday
(Figure 7.9). The history of market moves in response to sudden events has
demonstrated that such events generate an immediate reaction, but then is
followed by a significant retracement. A contrarian gold binary play was in
order and was placed.

On Monday, November 16, 2015, an alert was generated for two end-
of-week binary trades on the Nadex platform: it was a bet that gold would
decline by the end of the week (Table 7.2). It was not technical analysis that
was predominant, but sentiment analysis. The first trade was a deep-in-the-
money sell order that gold would not be above 1104.5. The second trade was
an out-of-the-money order that gold would go below 1074. Gold settled at
1074.2, close for the out-of-money play but not enough.
The Greek Crisis
The Eurozone, with its single currency, means the EUR/USD continues to
generate a perennial source of uncertainty and volatility. The fact is that it is
tough to sustain economic growth in countries that have huge public sector
welfare states. With the globalization of the world economy, countries with
large public sectors will find it more difficult than ever to compete. In recent
years, particularly since the financial credit crunch of 2008, the financial sta-
bility of countries such as Ireland, Greece, Spain, and Italy have been a focus
of the markets. The bond markets and the currency markets reflect these
concerns. We can see how much a higher yield the Greek two-year bond
had to offer above the benchmark German two-year bond (Figure 7.8). This
was in response to the downgraded confidence in Greece by the bond mar-
ket to meet its fiscal requirements. In any case, for the binary option trader,
the EUR/USD provides a trading opportunity when news hits the headlines
about financial crisis. This happened in May when Greece’s debt problem sur-
faced again. The rumors of a Greek pullout of the euro were all over the Net.
The EUR/USD weakened. Given these rumors and market reactions, the
binary option trading strategy could be, of course, to follow the mood of the
market and bet the EUR/USD would continue to fall. The alternative, to bet
the other way, may seem risky, but it felt correct because it’s politically naïve
to think that the Eurozone would let the Greek problem destroy it. Using this
reasoning, and being a bit contrarian that the bad news was already out and

the EUR/USD would actually go up, the following trade alert, on Thursday,
May 26, 2011, was released. Notice this was a Thursday trade, with only one
more day to expiration (see Figure 7.10).
The binary option trading alert written on this day was:
Bonus Binary Alert: Potential 15 Percent in Two Days
The Greek crisis in Europe has pushed the EUR/USD through
an important resistance. It’s wavering though, and this gives us a
bonus trade opportunity. It’s an example of a deep-in-the money
strategy. We are going with the sentiment that by Friday 3 p.m., the
EUR/USD will stay above 1.4075.

Trade Action to Take: Buy a Nadex weekly EUR/USD 1.4075
binary for under $90.
This costs us $80 to $89, and there is no guarantee. But if we’re
right, it will pay off $100, which gives us the 10 to 20 percent return.
The result of the trade alert was a 20 percent return in two days.
The bearish sentiment that seemed dominant early in the week on the
EUR/USD because of the Greek situation, did not last and the EUR/USD
broke through resistance. Therefore, buying a binary on the euro to expire
higher than 1.4075 trade can be considered as a contrarian bounce of sup-
port; a deep-in-the-money trade playing on the bearish sentiment being an
emotional panic in the midst of the Greek default fear.
The Greek debt problem seems to be a gift that keeps giving trading
opportunities. The concern about a Greek debt default built up to a new crisis
level as the Greek parliament scheduled a June 29 critical vote on a severe aus-
terity program to meet the demands of the European Central Bank to provide
further aid to Greece. The markets were nervous. Headlines alerted readers to
the upcoming suicide votes for the Greek parliament because a no vote was
considered a catastrophic event. This actually set up a trading opportunity in
the DAX 30 (Figure 7.11). Here is what the Agora alert said on the morning
of Monday, June 27 at 10:15 a.m.:
The 7225 binary is being offered at $35, making it an out-of-the-
money play—not too deep but worthwhile. If it works, it provides
us a nearly 3:1 return.

The Greek parliament approved the austerity package on June 29 and the
DAX 7225 binary moved in-the-money, providing a 3:1 return for those who
held the position to expiration on Friday, July 1.
The market conditions around the Greek crisis showed that the market
pricing on binaries that are out-of-the-money, are often mispriced, reflecting
extremes in pessimism.
Crude Oil and Near-the-Money Strategy
The oil complex is another underlying market that almost weekly presents
the opportunity to use different binary trading strategies. In late January,
revolts in Tunisia and Egypt erupted and raised the level of volatility in oil.
In fact, oil prices surged from below $85 to near $100 from January 1 to
March 1, 2011 (Figure 7.12). By Tuesday, February 1, 2011, at 2:15 p.m.,
the crude oil market was moving fast due to the fast-moving news from
Cairo (Figure 7.13). The conditions were ripe for an at-the-money binary
option trade. Notice that the cost of buying was at $45. Here is the real-time
recommendation that was released.
The Agora alert on this day was:
Action Alert: Take 38 Percent Profits Now!
Yesterday, I recommended two oil binary plays as a way to cash
in on uncertainty in Egypt. Now, with word that Egyptian President
Mubarak won’t run again, there might be some calm in the markets.
So we’re going to jump out of our more speculative of the binary plays.
Action to Take: Sell all of your Nadex weekly crude oil 89.75
binary options.
They’re currently at $62—representing a 38 percent gain from
our $45 entry price. Not bad at all!
And we’ll continue to hold the 87.75 oil binaries for now.
The result was a quick 38 percent win!
ATM Bounce Strategy
What can we learn from the oil trades during the Egyptian turmoil?
Essentially, if the underlying market patterns look like they are about to
break out, the best strategy that fits this condition is an at-the-money or near-
the-money strategy. The reasoning is that a small move will convert the binary
contract to result in an in-the-money settlement.

Another version of an at-the-money bounce strategy would be to play
bounces off either side. Bounce plays are in the lingo of technical analysis: mean
reversion plays betting that the price will move back toward the middle of the
range. The challenge for the bounce strategy is to decide how far it will bounce
off support or resistance and how quickly it will do that. A good method for
a bounce trade is not to go to expiration but to select a target price to close
the position. At-the-money bounce trades, costing $45 to $55 to get in, would

receive an objective of $75 to $80 to get out. Using a predetermined close order,
the return in these conditions would be a respectable 77 percent. This can be
within hours or just a few days. An alternative version of the at-the-money
bounce play would be when the binary option strike price is in the middle of the
range between support and resistance. In this scenario, the trader is really riding
the natural oscillation of the price action. I call this vibrating your way to profits.
Breakout Plays
Markets break out when you least expect it. When this happens, the binary
option trader can use technical analysis to trade the reaction. However, there

                     PAGE 145                     
==================================================

Binary Option Trading Strategies 143
are predictive patterns that are preludes to breaking out. Such patterns are
observed when the price forms narrow sideways channels, triangles, and
wedges. In these conditions, bullish and bearish sentiment is in a tug of war,
resulting in a tight range. Markets, by their very nature, abhor a vacuum of
information. As a result, the sideways pattern can be considered the calm
before, or in fact after, the storm. Such patterns calibrate well with putting on
a binary option breakout strategy.
Once a sideways or cluster of market pauses is detected, the challenge
to the trader is to anticipate which side the breakout will occur. Will it be
a breakout of support or resistance? One of the early tasks for putting on a
breakout trade is to locate resistance and support and find the binary contract
just above it to allow the benefit of a big market move. If the trader cannot
make a conclusive determination of the direction of the breakout, a straddle
play can also be applied, which plays a breakout in either direction. Breakout
plays are most commonly connected to economic data releases or reactions to
key statements by central bankers. For example, the statements of the Federal
Open Market Committee and the statements of key central bankers, such as
Trichet’s on May 5, provided ideal conditions for trading breakout plays. The
statement was scheduled, so traders could expect some movement. Trichet
surprised the market with dovish comments about intended interest rate
increases. The result was a selloff of the EUR/USD (Figure 7.14). Breakout
plays are most appropriate on economic data releases.

An interesting signal to the trader to play the breakout pattern is one that
is most ignored. It is actually the previous failed breakout trade on the same
underlying market. Traders often will encounter a sequence of losses and then
give up. But this kind of reasoning can be counterproductive. Sometimes the
trader is timing the breakout too early. In fact, if the previous week’s breakout
trade failed, the probability that the next one will work is actually greater
because markets don’t stay sideways too long. The following is an example of
a breakout trade alert that worked out that was based on locating a sideways
channel on the GBP/USD.
The Scottish Independence Referendum and the GBP/USD
In the fall of September 2014, the attention of world markets, and particu-
larly the British pound, centered on the upcoming vote on Scottish inde-
pendence. On September 18, 2014, the Scottish independence referendum
was scheduled and the election would decide if Scotland would become an
independent country. Obviously, the outcome would be important to the
economy of Great Britain and would affect its currency, the British pound.
The weeks leading up to the referendum generated great anxiety and inten-
sity. Political polling started to influence markets and in the summer of 2014,
the GBP/USD was beginning to reflect anxiety and optimism about the out-
come of the referendum. A yes vote was feared and the GBP/USD began to
decline in value (Figure 7.15). As August ended, the GBP/USD had actually
begun to rise. But, in September, popular opinion started to show that the yes
vote had a great chance of winning. In fact, on the weekend of September 7, a
poll showed that the yes vote was leading. This caused a gap down in the GBP
on the morning of Monday, September 8 (Figure 7.16). The binary play in
this case was that such a move down was fear, but it would take a few weeks
for the polls to confirm that the fear was over. Therefore, a selling deep in the
money binary trade for end of week expiration was a correct trade (Table 7.3).
Notice how the GBP/USD rose after the failed independence referendum
vote. The Scottish Independence referendum is a good example of why binary
traders should look to trade elections.

In It to Win It: The DOOM Strategy
Let’s consider the DOOM trade. This refers to deep-out-of-the-money plays.
In DOOM, the trader assumes that at any week, markets can go crazy,
and therefore puts on several DOOM plays. They may not always work
out, but when markets experience selloffs, those putting on binary option

deep-out-of-the-money trades get the huge returns. While most trading
occurs when markets are in relatively normal conditions, when major selloffs
do not occur, it’s not a bad idea to put on one DOOM play each week as an
insurance policy for when the unexpected occurs. The only caveat with such
an approach is it will not pay off all the time.
During the week ending July 1, 2014, however, almost every DOOM
strategy on indexes did pay off. The pessimism and fear over the Greek crisis,
plus the nervousness of the market in relationship to U.S. debt negotiations,
created a very low price on the S&P 500 out-of-the-money ladders. Here is
what the Agora binary alert stated on Monday, June 27, at 10:15 a.m.



==================================================
                     PAGE 149                     
==================================================

Binary Option Trading Strategies 147
Finally, the federal debt ceiling negotiations set up the DOOM play
of the week. The situation between Congress and the president is
very tenuous. Any sign that a compromise is coming will cheer the
markets, but if there is still a deadlock going into the July Fourth
holiday, we can expect a big selloff. This possibility leads to the
following deep-out-of-the-money trade on the S&P 500:
Trade Action: Buy two or more Nadex weekly U.S. 500 1296.5
binaries at market.
With the S&P 500 Sept. futures—the binaries’ underlying
instrument—at 1268, a DOOM binary at 1296.5 at $15.50 provides
a greater than 6:1 return.
With the Greek parliament approval of the austerity plan, the
markets moved strongly into the money for a very large return on the
DOOM play as the S&P 500 overnight doubled the binary option
offer price and actually went in-the-money, returning $100 for every
$15.50 lot [Figure 7.17].

When Markets Are Overextended: Selling the Ladders
There are times when markets have extended beyond expectations into
outlier statistical territory. These are situations in which new highs or lows
have been created at a very fast pace. Taking a contrarian position in these
conditions means anticipating that the crowd is wrong, exhausted, or that a
natural retracement is bound to happen. The strategy to be employed in this
scenario is selling the extreme ladders. Using the bid/ask range as a criterion,
binary contracts that are $10 to $15 or less are essentially targets of contrarian
thinking. Selling the binary bid would mean paying $100 bid price. A $15
ask price would reflect mean that the traders are assigning only a 15 percent
probability of success. The seller would, at best, keep the $10. Before one
employs this strategy, the question becomes: Is it worth it? Selling premium
seems, at first glance, to provide easy pickings for the trader. However, it can
be a very dangerous strategy. We need to remember that underlying markets
that are extended become extended for a fundamental reason. Unless there is
evidence of a change in the fundamentals, playing a reversal of an extended
trend is fraught with danger.
Surprise Event Risks: The Great 2011 Japanese Earthquake
We have seen markets riled by surprise events. Earthquakes and revolts and
terrorist attacks have in common, at first, the element of surprise. Initial news
shocks the markets. But these events also have in common surprise followed
by the reaction of the markets similar to a chemical reaction diffusion process.
The markets react and then the initial shock wave is diffused out. It is in the
reaction phase when binary option trading opportunities occur. The great
Japanese earthquake of March 11, 2011 is a case in point.
Let’s look at what happened in reaction to the Japanese earthquake of
March 11. The Japanese earthquake immediately brought USD/JPY cur-
rency pair into play. The initial reaction of the yen was to strengthen. The
morning before the earthquake, the USD/JPY pair was at 82. It descended
to 76.25 by March 17 in reaction to the devastation (Figure 7.18A). This
7 percent decline in the currency pair was a surprise to many traders, as
such a surprising strengthening of the currency is anathema to an economy
in shock. But the crowd reacted to rumors of repatriation. This is when
Japanese companies sell foreign assets and convert the cash to yen to bal-
ance their books. In any case, the yen surged against the U.S. dollar. In
response to the Japan earthquake, the initial reaction was also a decline in
the Nikkei (Figure 7.18B). What is also most instructive is the relationship

between the Nikkei and the S&P 500. As we can see, they moved in tandem
(Figure 7.18B).
Other global fundamental forces were triggered immediately. The totally
unpredictable earthquake caused a reaction in the oil markets. Oil fell as the
market perceived a disruption in demand coming from a major global econ-
omy such as Japan. This reaction was in anticipation that Japanese refineries
were shutting down. But let’s get to the real sizzler—the USD/JPY movements
that became the object of an extraordinary binary play (Figure 7.18A). Keep in
mind that the chart of the USD/JPY is the dollar versus the yen. So a strong yen
will have the chart going in a down direction as the dollar falls against the yen.
One of the features associated with trading currency pairs also bene-
fited the strategy. The USD/JPY can be traded at night in the United States.
The 12-hour difference in time allows an evening trade. After a very strong
strengthening of the yen, the opportunity for buying an out-of-the-money
binary option contract on the yen was irresistible. Watching the reports that
weekend from Japan was riveting. It took a lot of patience not to trade on
Monday morning, but on Wednesday, March 16 at 6:50 p.m., the Nadex
weekly USD/JPY binary strike price of 79.25 reached a very low ask price of
$22. Hours before, the spot market actually hit a historic strength of the yen,
near 76.00. It was a classic case of a huge outlier, black swan event! In the Stra-
tegic Currency Trader newsletter, the following recommendation was issued:
Bonus Alert: Following the Bouncing Yen for 400 Percent Return in
Three Days
It has been an extraordinary week that has generated some
extraordinary opportunities. Earlier this week, I suggested two yen
binary plays, hoping for a bounce. While those are a long way from
panning out, I see a new play that could more than make up for
them. As you know, the USD/JPY experienced a historic downward
spike due to the unfolding disasters in Japan. But the Bank of Japan
is not likely to let the yen stay at historical strength. So we have a
limited window to try to catch a bounce.
Trade Action to Take: Buy a weekly Nadex USD/JPY 79.25
binary for $25 or better.
The result was a successful in-the-money settlement by Friday returning
4:1! When surprises hit the global markets, the best conditions emerge for
out-of-the-money and deep-out-of-the-money strategies.

THE TANKAN REPORT
For traders looking to trade the USD/JPY binary options it’s very important to
know when the Tankan report comes out. Th e survey is conducted to provide an
accurate picture of business trends of enterprises in Japan, thereby contributing
to the appropriate implementation of monetary policy. Th e survey is conducted
quarterly in March, June, September, and December. Th e survey results are
released at the beginning of April, July, October, and mid-December (released
at 8:50 a.m. Japanese Standard Time).
Chinese Yuan Devaluation, Shanghai Selloff and Binaries
Now, let’s jump forward to one of the most important trading events
in recent times. On August 11, 2015, the Chinese authorities devalued
the yuan and the surprise action disrupted the global markets. The yuan
was trading previously in a 2 percent volatility band. The move sud-
denly departed from that band. The reason for the devaluation was essen-
tially to weaken the currency to stimulate exports, which had fallen over
8.3 percent from the previous year. But the devaluation created a signal
that the world should be worried about China’s growth. The Shanghai
index and then the global markets subsequently sold off after this period,
resulting in “black” Monday on August 24 (Figure 7.19 ). After the sell-
off, the Chinese authorities intervened in their markets and stabilized the
down trend.
A binary trading opportunity became irresistible when President Xi
visited the United States during the week ending Sept 25. Th e China a50
weekly binary tracks the Shanghai index. Betting that during the week the
president of China visits the United States, the market would NOT sell off
was a classic sentiment play. Th e exact alert was to: BUY CHINA A50 9425
STRIKE PRICE @ ASK 57.75 (Table 7.4 ).
Th e winning trade returned $100 fi xed payout and as a result the profi t
was 42.25, generating a return of 73 percent on the initial risk of $597.75.
Th is was an example of when sentiment analysis and an understanding of
geopolitics generated the rationale for a deep-in-the-money position that had
a strong chance of winning.

The crisis in Ukraine in March of 2014 provides another example of how
markets react and counter-react in a sudden event crisis. Once again, the
USD/JPY reaction to the Ukraine crisis was a classic case of risk aversion on
Monday to risk appetite by Friday (Figure 7.20).
The lesson learned from this response is for traders to look at doing a
contrarian binary trade when a sudden event causes markets to sell off. The
end-of-week duration is the best one to use.

Perfect Storm Conditions: U.S. Election Week
It’s a good idea to trade binary options before a key election contest such
congressional and the U.S. presidential votes. The quadrennial presidential
election week is likely to result in extraordinary binary trading opportunities,
especially if it is a closely predicted election. The good news is that we don’t
have to predict the winner. We just need to ride the volatility. It will not only
be election week, but the ramp up to it, right after the September Labor Day
holiday, is the traditional start of campaigning.
To best prepare for trading during an election week, it is very instructive
to look at what happened in the important 2010 congressional elections. The
2010 U.S. congressional elections is a case study of known-in-advance condi-
tions for large market reactions.
The week of November 1 had a confluence of three events: the U.S.
elections on November 2, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)
statement on Wednesday at 2:15 p.m. regarding QE2 policy, and the non-
farm payroll data release. There was more—on top of this trifecta of events
were scheduled statements from the Bank of England, the European Central
Bank, and the Bank of Japan. It was a combination that simulated an asteroid
penetration of the atmosphere. The result was guaranteed price movements.

Here is an example of real-time analysis in the Agora report of this upcoming
week and the resulting binary option strategy suggested.
Election Week Recommendations, Part 1
U.S. Election & FOMC Binary Plays
This week, the FOMC is expected to announce the start of its
second round of quantitative easing, being called QE2. This com-
bined with the election results will energize sentiment regarding the
U.S. dollar. Even though the prevailing sentiment is bearish, there
can be a large move in either direction. So we’ll use USD/CHF
binaries to capture any breakout moves in either direction. The U.S.
dollar/Swiss franc (USD/CHF) is a great surrogate for U.S. dollar
sentiment, as you can see in [Figure 7.21].
Trade Action to Take: Sell one or more Nadex weekly USD/
CHF .9775 binaries.
Then buy one or more Nadex weekly USD/CHF 1.0075 binaries.
With multiple binaries, you can leg out of positions during the part of
a position to let the others ride.
At the time of the recommendation on Monday morning of election week,
traders saw a sideways market in the USD/CHF. The USD/CHF was hover-
ing above support. It looked like perfect conditions for a breakout pattern
(Figure 7.22). Also, the binary option strike ladders for Monday morning

showed that the out-of-the-money strike prices were very cheap (Table 7.5).
The spot price was around .9850.
Of course, the election week meant opportunities in the S&P 500. The
S&P 500 was also noted to be in a sideways range on November 1, 2010
(Figure 7.23).

Here is what I said in the Agora Strategic Currency Trader alert:
While we don’t know which way the market will move, the reward-
to-risk opportunity is in a move up from current levels. My inclina-
tion was to try an 1180.5 binary, but at $60, the premium is too
high. The 1200.5 binary is priced at $31 and provides us a better
return, but will require a stronger move. Still, I am recommending
taking a shot at the 1200.5 binary, expecting positive market action
after a big Republican victory and the first injection of QE2. It pays
off if the S&P 500 is above 1200.5 at 4:15 p.m. on Friday.
This election week produced phenomenal results. The markets followed
this script perfectly. The USD/CHF binary breakout play paid off with a
return of $100 per share on a total $40 cost. Similarly, the S&P 500 1200.5
binary contract cost $32 and paid off $100 per share after a strong move in
reaction to the election (Table 7.6).
Correlation Trades: Running the Board
We know that the underlying markets are often highly correlated, or have
strong co-movements, as global sentiment on risk appetite or risk aver-
sion cascades around the world. Many of these correlations were reviewed
throughout this book. The trader should be aware of the correlations because
they lead to correlation trades, or running the board. One approach to apply-
ing this strategy is to trade two or more different underlying binary mar-
kets that are highly correlated to each other. The rationale is that being right
on one pair allows one to increase the return by putting on a trade in the

correlated markets. Crude oil and Canadian dollar, USD/JPY, and S&P 500,
AUD/USD, and copper are proven strongly correlated pairs. The correlations
may not be the same strength at any given time. When they reach above 70
percent, however, the conditions are good for correlated trading. Table 7.7
shows recent correlation data between these pairs.

Accessing the latest information on correlation is important, and an easy
way to accomplish this is to use the free correlation data published at www
.mrci.com/special/corr030.php. This site tracks correlations from 30 days to
180 days. The trader should keep in mind that correlation data will vary over
time and tracking the correlations from time to time is most useful.
Trading binaries with one-week and intraday periods can be aided by
scanning shorter-term correlations. A site for accessing shorter-term correla-
tions is: www.myfxbook.com/forex-market/correlation.
Noncorrelated Trades
The other side of a correlated trading strategy is to diversify the week’s binary
trades along with the most noncorrelated. Following the data presented in

Table 7.7, a trader looking to have minimum correlations in trading underly-
ing equity indexes would be trading the Japan 225 and the FTSE 100, which
show the lowest correlation of 37 percent.
Combination Strategies
The review of binary option trading strategies essentially implies a pure
approach—putting on one strategy at a time. In fact, this is rarely recom-
mended. The alternatives to pure strategies are combination strategies that
look to benefit from a variety of market conditions during a week. What
should be considered is a mixed set of strategies. For example, putting on
three deep-in-the-money trades with one deep-out-of-the-money trade.
Alternatively, the trader could be putting on three deep-out-of-the-money,
three deep-in-the-money, and four at-the-money trades. Regardless of the
combination, option strategies should match market conditions. Two com-
bined strategy examples are:
1. Put on: three deep-in-the-money with one deep-out-of-the-money.
2. Put on: one-third deep-out-of-the-money, one-third deep-in-the-money,
and one-third at-the-money.
There are many different strategies to match a variety of market condi-
tions and technical patterns. It’s a good idea to try all of them over time to
build your skills (Figure 7.24).
This chapter has provided a tour of how binary option trading strategies
are intimately related to understanding not only the technical conditions of
the market, but the fundamentals and the prevailing sentiment moods.
Selecting the right underlying Market:
leaderboard Selection Strategies
Beyond being able to scan market patterns and follow news events, trading
binaries comes down to selecting the right underlying market to trade. Many
traders have a tendency to trade what they like, rather than spend time scan-
ning the global markets. The disadvantage of trading what one likes lies in the
potential of missing other profitable opportunities. A remedy to this myopic
tendency is implementing a Leaderboard Selection Strategy.

KEY QUESTIONS EACH WEEK FOR EVERY BINARY TRADER
PART 1, FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS
Here are some key questions that should be on your checklist before you take
off on your binary trade.
• Which markets are the big movers?
• Which markets are on top of the leaderboard?
• Which markets are at the bottom?
• Is the market “risk-on” or “risk-off ”?
• Where is gold and what does it mean for market direction?
• Is the U.S. dollar sentiment bullish or bearish?
• Is crude oil up or down?
• Is gold in a range or breaking up or down?

• Is China’s economy expected to increase in GDP?
• Which markets are diverging from their usual correlations?
• What is the “balance of fears” facing the markets as the week begins?
• Did you check this week’s “economic calendar”?
• Is there a special economic data release announcement coming in the week
that will move the markets?
• Are there elections in the coming weeks that are likely to aff ect the market?
• Are interest rates expected to go up or down at the next Central Bank
decision?
• Which central banks are considering increases in rates?
Th e leaderboard selection strategy answers the question of which markets
are the big movers? A good way to choose what to trade is to trade what the
markets are paying attention to.
A heat map is a great tool for this (Table 7.8 ). At any moment in time
during the week, some markets are outperforming others. In other words,
some are hot and some are not. A good idea is to select the best performer
and the worst performer as targets for your trades. A useful Internet site
for fi nding the latest movers in the market is www.fi nviz.com . It provides
what is known as a “heat map” of price movements. Th is is a quick way of
spotting the big movers in either direction. In the heat map that follows,
the JPY and the CAD are the biggest winner and loser in terms of relative
performance. Th e binary trader would, using this leaderboard, look for trad-
ing opportunities in these two underlying markets.

Another site, www.myfxbook.com/forex-market/heat-map, generates
rankings in pips, or in percent against a range of time durations (1 minute,
5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hours, daily, weekly, and monthly).
Relative changes in which markets move greatest in either direction gen-
erates strategies to follow or fade a particular market.

Chapter 8
Analyzing NFP Data
for Binary Trading
This chapter provides strategies for evaluating and trading the nonfarm payroll
data release. The NFP report is considered the key economic data release in
the world. The United States Department of Labor releases the NFP report
on the first Friday of every month at 8:30 a.m. EST. All traders are watching
and markets are affected by it as it signals a monthly gauge on the strength of
the U.S. economy, this data release and the binary option related to it is one
of the most important offered to traders. It is also one of the most challenging.
The opportunity to trade the NFP data release is offered by Nadex and by IG,
as there are specific binary ladders on this release (Table 8.1). Unlike binaries
that have an actual underlying market such as a currency or commodity, the
NFP binaries have job levels as the underlying market.
Another related event risk binary offered is on the jobless claims data. The
jobless claims underlying market is simply the economic data record that is
reported on the number of first-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits.
These are applications for jobless benefits. While important, it is not as impor-
tant as the NFP report. Traders should become competent in trading binaries
relating to the NFP release before they start trading the jobless claims data.
Trading the binary options on event data releases presents a unique set of
challenges to the trader as well as the market maker. The trader faces the chal-
lenge of how to conduct technical analysis of the jobless claims and nonfarm
payroll charts. The answers to these questions are not obvious or easy. The
uncertainty around the data releases of jobless claims and nonfarm payroll
charts should not be surprising. There are frequent surprises in the numbers.

Headlines following the jobless claims data releases reflect the ongoing sur-
prise of the results. On April 28, 2011, a Bloomberg headline was “Jobless
Claims in U.S. Unexpectedly Rise to Three Month High.” Another headline
on May 5, 2011: “Jobless Claims in U.S. Unexpectedly Jump on One-Time
Events.” What is a typical reaction to surprise? A major surprise happened on
the October 2015 NFP data release on November 4. The nonfarm payroll
report astounded the market with results of 271,000 new jobs. This result
signaled a strengthening U.S. economy and increased market confidence that
interest rates would be raised by the end of 2015. One can also note the
decline in the NFP results prior to the 2008 collapse (Figure 8.1).
Evidently, our best number crunchers don’t know how to accurately
predict these economic levels. The question arises, why should the binary
option trader have a better handle on the results? Certainly, the binary
option trader will have a challenging time mastering trading binaries
relating to predictions of employment levels. In any case, there are some
useful approaches to deciding on direction of the NFP report. One strategy
is to locate what the “gurus” are forecasting. There are several sources of
professional forecasts. A good place to start is the latest professional eco-
nomic forecasts of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. It issues a
quarterly Survey of Professional Forecasters (https://www.philadelphiafed.org/
research-and-data/real-time-center/survey-of-professional-forecasters/).
Here is what the last survey of 2015 stated:
Growth in real GDP in 2016 and 2017 looks a little slower now
than it did three months ago, according to 45 forecasters surveyed

by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The forecasters
currently see growth in the annual-average level of real GDP at
2.6 percent in 2016 and 2.5 percent in 2017. These current esti-
mates represent downward revisions to the outlook of three months
ago, when the forecasters thought 2016 growth would be 2.8 percent
and 2017 growth would be 2.6 percent. Notably, the forecasters
have raised their growth estimates for 2018. They now see real
GDP growing 2.8 percent in 2018, up from the previous estimate
of 2.4 percent.
A slightly improved outlook for the unemployment rate accompa-
nies the outlook for growth. The forecasters predict the unemployment
rate will be an annual average of 5.3 percent in 2015, before falling to
4.8 percent in 2016, 4.7 percent in 2017, and 4.7 percent in 2018. The
projections for 2016 and 2017 are below those of the last survey.
On the jobs front, the panelists have revised upward their esti-
mates for job gains in the first three quarters of 2016. The forecast-
ers see nonfarm payroll employment growing at a rate of 201,500
jobs per month this quarter and 188,200 jobs per month next
quarter. The forecasters’ projections for the annual-average level of

nonfarm payroll employment suggest job gains at a monthly rate
of 241,800 in 2015 and 197,000 in 2016. (These annual-average
estimates are computed as the year-to-year change in the annual-
average level of nonfarm payroll employment, converted to a
monthly rate.)
In the Philadelphia survey, the trader can obtain very detailed
summaries of different forecasts regarding real GDP, unemployment
rate, payrolls, and inflation levels. (Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia 2015)
For those traders looking to gain an edge in predicting a strong NFP report,
checking on several sources of economic forecasts is advisable. One of the most
interesting is the Anxious Index. It reflects whether economists are hopeful or
anxious about the prospects of GDP growth or decline and the prospects of a
recession. It is taken every quarter by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.
They describe it: “The anxious index peaks during recessions, then declines
when recovery seems near.” It can be used by traders as a contrarian signal for
the economy. It’s a good idea to keep tabs on the results (see Figure 8.2). We
can also see how the Anxious Index was at extreme highs before the financial
collapse of 2008 (Figure 8.3).
To be sure, a great deal of quantitative research is being done to attempt
to obtain better predictions for nonfarm payrolls. Recent research uses Google
Trends as a predictive tool for these event binaries. Researchers D’Amuri and

Marcucci from the Bank of Italy said about the use of Google to quantify
search trends: “We suggest the use of an Internet job-search indicator (the
Google Index, GI) as the best leading indicator to predict the U.S. unem-
ployment rate. . . . We fi nd that models augmented with the GI outperform
the traditional ones in predicting the monthly unemployment rate, even in
most state-level forecasts and in comparison with the survey of professional
forecasters.”

Th e trader is not the only one who has a challenge regarding trading the
binaries on the nonfarm payroll releases. Th e market maker has a unique
problem in pricing event binaries because the Black-Scholes model, which is
used to generate pricing for the regular underlying markets, can’t be applied.
So this means the market maker has a lot more risk exposure when deciding
to put on a price for a particular binary ladder.
Key Steps Before Trading Nonfarm Payroll
and Job Claims Binaries
Th ere are several analytical questions that need to be asked and answered by
anyone set on trading these event risks.
What Is the Consensus on the Coming Data Release?
Several analysts and economists off er their opinions about the upcoming
numbers. Reuters and Bloomberg poll a sample of experts. Tradingeconomics
.com releases estimates as well. Historically, there is surprise in actual versus
estimate outcomes. Sometimes there is great surprise and as a result the mar-
kets react with volatility. However, those traders who want to develop an
opinion of whether the nonfarm payroll will hit new highs or lows can get into
the data at a more focused level. Th ey can seek to answer several questions.
Is There a Trending Pattern in the Data?
Th e United States Department of Labor issues a report called the U nemployment
Insurance Weekly Claims Report . Th e four-week moving average seasonally
adjusted (SA) is the key row to look at.

==================================================

Analyzing NFP Data for Binary Trading 169
Look at the data and ask yourself: Is the moving average of claims going
up, down, or sideways? The trader can also apply basic technical analysis to the
employment data. For example, on the NFP chart (Figure 8.1), one can apply
classical trend line, support, and resistance analysis to the data and we can see
that from January 2006 to April 2009, job losses were increasing every month,
but stopped decreasing in April 2009. A binary trader would logically play
the downtrend during this period by betting that the NFP report would not
generate new highs. This would mean selling the highest or next to the highest
ladder. Noticing that a shift in the trend occurred after April 2009, the binary
strategy that would have been logical would have been to bet on an increasing
ability to generate jobs, or that no new lows would occur. This would mean
buying the lowest or next to the lowest binary ladder. When the NFP shows a
sideways action, a wide binary option range trade would be logical.
Is There Consensus Error Bias?
Evaluating the technical trend can be supplemented by evaluating the trend
in the consensus. Even more important is evaluating whether there is a bias
in the consensus. Forecasts are often wrong, but more important to know
is whether the error is underestimating or overestimating. In studying data
produced by Tradingeconomics.com, we can see in Table 8.2 that there is a
challenge in achieving accuracy.

Nov-11-2015 180k 271k
Dec-4-2015 200k 211k
Here are some tips for traders of nonfarm payroll reports:
• If the most recent actual results were greater than the estimate, the strategy
for the binary option trader for NFP data release is to go for out-of-the-money
strike prices on the next release. Remember, since there is no underlying mar-
ket, the consensus estimate can be used as the at-the-money spot market.
• If the recent actual results are below the consensus, the strategy for the
binary option trader for the next data release is to go for playing in-the-
money strike prices.
• If the employment data has no reliable trend, and is very choppy, find the
strike price that is above but closest to the result, and the strike price that is
below but closest to the results. Put on a breakout strategy.

• If NFP data breaks a trend line, use in-the-money or deep-in-the-money
binary strike prices to go with the direction.
• If the jobless claims data breaks uptrend, or is getting close to breaking it,
consider an out-of-the-money sell position.
Tactics for Trading NFP report in Binaries
We have focused on analyzing the NFP data and getting a grip on direction.
Let’s focus on tactics. What are the alternative ways of trading the NFP report.
This applies to any binary, whether it is a ladder binary or a regular high-low
binary. There are several strategies.
First, it is important to note that one can trade the NFP report by trading
binaries on the EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and the S&P 500. These markets will
likely react and move big with the NFP results. The trader needs to choose an
expiration that allows the trade to benefit from the momentum of the market.
This means the expiration should be short-term from 1-minute to 30-minute
durations. Regardless of the durations, there are several trading strategies to
consider. Let’s examine them now.
Strategy 1: Anticipate Data Release Results
In this strategy, the trader believes she knows what the results of the news release
will be (see Figure 8.4 and Table 8.3). She consequently chooses a direction before
the news release. If the trader was trading spot, the action would be to put on a

Action Advisory
Choose trade direction Buy or sell
Choose option expiration Select option that expires 5 to 10 minutes after data release
Execute trade 5 to 10 minutes before data release
market order before the news release in the anticipated direction. However, for
binaries, the trader chooses an option that will expire shortly after the data release.
Strategy 2A: Trade at Data Release in a Bullish Direction
In this strategy, the market has reacted and it is going bullish (see Figure 8.5
and Table 8.4). The trade is to buy the next expiration binary, which will enable
participation in the direction of the break. The disadvantage of this strategy is
that prices could reverse and the reaction is not as strong to ride it out through
the next expiration binary.

Strategy 2B: Sell Trade at Data Release
The benefit of this strategy is that the trader doesn’t have to guess the results
of the news release (see Figure 8.6 and Table 8.5). The market has reacted and
is bearish in this case. Go and sell the next expiration binary as soon as the
news breaks out. It will enable participation in the direction of the break. The
disadvantage of this strategy is that prices could reverse and the reaction is not
as strong to ride it out through the next expiration binary.
Strategy 3A: (Buy) Trade at Fibonacci Points
In this strategy, the trader waits for the initial reaction of the news release to
be over (see Figure 8.7 and Table 8.6). If the reaction is bullish, wait until the
price starts reversing. The trader puts on a Fibonacci retracement tool and
finds the key Fibonacci points. The trader waits for the market to go to those

Strategy 3B: (Sell) Trade at Fibonacci Points
In this strategy, the trader waits for the initial reaction of the news release,
which in this scenario is a bearish reaction (see Figure 8.8 and Table 8.7). Wait
for it to be over. The trader puts on a Fibonacci retracement tool and finds the
key Fibonacci points. The trader waits for the market to go to those points. It
will try to reverse back up. Put on a next expiration trade in the new direction.

Timing and Managing Trades During the Week
We have considered event risks as triggered by political and market-driven
events. But there is another kind of event risk—the days of the week. The
process of analysis is important, but the probability of success also depends
upon timing decisions. The trader has to learn which strategies work better
on which days of the week.

Contrarian Mondays
Monday mornings (3 a.m. EST) are when the binary option trading week
essentially begins. Monday mornings represent, perhaps, the best opportunity
to be a contrarian. The distance in time from Monday morning when markets
in Asia open to Friday afternoon when the U.S. equity markets close provides
a great deal of room for the unexpected events and changes in the mood of
the market. Abraham Lincoln referred to the silent artillery of time as one of
the most powerful weapons. It is true for traders. Time fuels hope as well as
delusion. The initial opinion polls that form around a binary option strike
price on Monday morning are the most likely to change and be wrong. The
market mood formed on Monday mornings is based on lagging information
from the events of the previous week. The previous week’s reaction to news
and surprises has had time to diffuse. The new week presents new potential
for mis-speculation and misjudgments. This leads to good conditions for
putting on high return trades, offering more than 100 to 500 percent returns
for the week. Monday morning becomes the best time slot for putting on
initial trades.
Missing Monday: Initiating Trades on Tuesday
One strategy that requires some patience but can pay off strategically can be
called Missing Monday. If Monday is the time when misjudgments occur,
then Tuesday provides a reprieve. There may even be justification for wait-
ing until Tuesday to do binary option trades. The rationale is that there is
a value in waiting for more information. By Tuesday, initial assumptions
about the week have been absorbed by the market, thereby offering less risk.
Less risk, however, may mean lower returns. Putting on a trade on Tuesday
offers less probable opportunities for 100 to 500 percent binary settlement
values. Even so, on Tuesday, $30 to $45 ask prices still provide excellent
return potential.
Surfing the Volatility Wave: At-the-Money Wednesdays
By Wednesday, the market has had time to absorb news. Price patterns have
had time to solidify or probe their important levels of resistance and support.
Emotions have dissipated somewhat and often what was expected on Monday
morning has just collapsed and gone the other way. But by Wednesday, it is
midweek in uncertainty. This makes Wednesday a good day for at-the-money
(ATM) trades.

Going with the Crowd: Deep-in-the-Money Thursdays
Deep-in-the-money strategies make sense on Thursdays because, by that time,
the market has formed a crowd or consensus of opinion on many of the market
patterns. By Thursday, an additional strategy unfolds in this scenario. If the ask
has gone to $75, the market mood is now definitely optimistic. It would take
some new information, or event surprises, to trigger a reversal of the trend direc-
tion. With 75 percent expected probability of success, the very same crowd-
mind, which we tend to doubt as accurate on Monday, is much more reliable
on Thursday. With only two days left to expiration, a binary option trade with
a $75 ask represents a 25 percent return in two days. Not bad by any standard.
Last Chance: Very-Deep-in-the-Money Fridays
Initiating a trade on Friday is appropriate for loading up on a position. By
Friday, probability streams have narrowed and reduced the opportunities to
very deep-in-the-money plays, such as $85 to $90 asks. This means the mar-
ket is very confident of a binary strike price settling at $100. While such plays
return zero to 15 percent in a few hours, they also risk 85 to 90 percent. Trad-
ing this strategy requires a high level of technical confirmation.
A different view of binary option trading opportunities is worth con-
sidering—the once-a-month trade. Once every month, the nonfarm payroll
data release moves the markets. A breakout strategy put on for the first week
of every month (since the nonfarm payroll report comes out the first Friday of
every month) may be all you need to satisfy the challenge and excitement of
binary option trading.
using Binaries with Forex Trading
An application worthy of much further analysis, but slightly beyond the scope
of this book, is the use of binary options in combination with spot trading.
Because binary options pay out a fixed amount if a strike price is penetrated,
and settles in-the-money, they can be viewed as a form of rebate insurance. For
example, if a trader had a long position in the EUR/USD spot market, he can
also select a sell binary option strike price in which he would have placed a stop.
If the EUR/USD sold off and he incurred losses in his spot account at the same
time, the binary account would pay off. This can offset part or all of the loss.
One can view the binary option as a form of hedge as well when doing cor-
related trades. For example, if a trader was trading crude oil futures, she can at the

same time put on a trade in the opposite direction on the USD/CAD. Remem-
ber, they are from a technical point of view inversely correlated. Being long on
oil, and being wrong, would likely see the USD/CAD rise. Therefore, a trader
being long on oil would also be long the USD/CAD binary to provide a form of
a hedge. A USD/CHF trade may be used to hedge an S&P equity trade.
A Word on intraday and intra-Hour Strategies
So far, we have not directly discussed trading binaries, intraday or even intra-
hour. Actually, there is no difference from a strategy point of view. These
short-term duration trades enable the same strategies to be played but in a
compressed time frame. An at-the-money bid/ask quote will still be essentially
near $50 for an intraday binary. The difference, however, lies in the timing
skills of the trader. Trading intraday requires very effective understanding of
momentum, volatility, and technical analysis. In contrast, the weekly binary
plays use fundamental analysis more effectively.

Risk Management in
Theory and Practice
We all know that there is no free lunch. The high returns offered by binary
option trades are accompanied by risks. The goal of a good risk management
program for binary option trading is not to eliminate risks. That is impossible.
Each trader has to learn to balance the risks and the rewards. The task requires
a handle on one’s own personal risk curve as well as tactics that detect risk
exposures in the price action. Let’s first review some important aspects of
personal risk psychology and management.
Consider the following scenario: It is Wednesday and you have put on a
binary trade that can be closed at $70. What would you rather have: A sure
100-percent capture of the profit, or wait until Friday’s expiration and try for
a $100 payout, representing a return of 150 percent but possibly risk it all?
What would you do? This is not that simple a question and what your answer
would actually be is likely to change as you are navigating through your
monthly performance. Actually, you have to ask yourself another question:
What do you really care about in the trade? Are you only interested in the final
value of the trade, or the trade itself becomes an experience that is worthy of
the risk? Social scientists refer to the trader who cares only about the final
value as operating under expected utility theory (EUT). But research shows
that people trade for more than just a final value. Many traders trade for
entertainment value. Recent research published in an article titled “Why Do
People Trade?” concluded: “Like lottery players who buy tickets with negative
expected values, entertainment-driven investors trade even though trading

diminishes the expected monetary payoff of their portfolio” (Dorn 2008). In
other words: trading is fun. This particularly applies to binary option trading.
Deal or No Deal?
Let’s play the game Deal or No Deal. To repeat the question: What would you
rather have: A sure 100-percent capture of the profit, or wait until Friday’s
expiration and try for a $100 payout, representing a return of 150 percent but
possibly risk it all? How you answer this question reveals a great deal about
your risk attitude, preference, or your level of loss aversion, as well as how you
should customize a risk management approach to your trading.
The first step in the binary options risk management plan is to identify
your risk personality. Are you an all-or-nothing trader, putting on the trades
and letting them go the distance with either a $100 or $0 payout? Or are
you a leg-out trader, willing to get out at a sure 100 percent return and leave
some lots on for the remaining duration? In the heat of the moment, in trad-
ing, very often what you planned goes out the window and what you do is
a departure. It’s important to realize that the reversal of risk preferences that
occur in the middle of a trade is not necessarily a failure of planning; rather,
it is the reality that trading decisions are not totally rational. Nor should they
be. Traders operate instead with what social scientists have termed bounded
rationality. Risk management becomes a process of satisfying behavior.
Trading binary options always involves emotional influences. They are not
wrong. But few traders examine their inventory of emotions that affect their trad-
ing. The basic set of emotions that all of us have are also likely to be encountered
during trading. These emotions include happiness, fear, disgust, and anger. While
trading, ask yourself which of these emotions are affecting your entry and exit
decisions. How many times will a trader get out of a position and leave profits on
the table because of anger over a previous losing streak? Or, how many times will a
trader be reticent about putting on a trade, because it is following a losing streak?
Is a deep-out-of-the-money trade justified by a technical analysis process, or is it
an outcome of a trader’s instincts? When is optimism on a binary option trade
excessive? We have to realize that risk control becomes more than the mathemat-
ics of profitability; it is also a process of managing emotions.
The Confidence Index
In an article in the Journal of Behavioral Finance, the authors discuss confidence:
“Confidence in one’s abilities is always helpful in one’s achievements in life. But
overconfidence in finance and investment may result in suboptimal decision



==================================================
                     PAGE 182

making and inferior investment performance.” Another leading work on behav-
ioral finance by Max Bazerman (2008, 141) states: “Once people make an invest-
ment, they tend to be overly optimistic about its future profitability and later
maintain optimistic recollection of the investment’s past performance.”
Therefore, you can see there is a tenuous balance between confidence
and overconfidence. How can this balance be secured? There are many
approaches for handling emotions in trading. In fact, an entire new field
called neuroscience and finance has emerged to investigate how the human
brain reacts to risk and reward. But at this point, the trader needs some
practical guidance.
A good way to track your emotional decisions on your binary option
trades is to rank each trade when you put it on. This simple task goes a long
way to enabling you to evaluate the role of emotions in your trading results.
Are you extremely confident? Give it a score of 5. Are you very confident,
but not to the extreme? Give it a score of 4. Are you tentative but consider it
worth trying? Give it a 3. However, if the ranking is less than 3 you should
consider not trading it, because a rank of 2 and below is really being a con-
trarian to your own best judgment.
Ultimately, after a series of trades, you will be able to get a distribution of
your initial confidence ranking against the outcome. If your emotional intel-
ligence is strong, your most confident trades would show significantly more
wins than losses. If you are a very intuitive trader, then your trades ranked 3
will show more than 50 percent wins.
Lot Size Management
A crucial trading decision rule is determining lot size or the size of the binary
bet. One of the most common and dangerous mistakes made by binary option
traders is putting on a big position because of overconfidence. Many traders
also endanger their prospects of profitability because they put on trades in
the absence of confirmations that the fundamental and technical conditions
justify greater weight to the trade. There are several solutions to the problem
of determining lot size.
First, let’s consider the rule of three. The rule applies here to the number
of lots that should be put on. This rule can be used for trading in many
markets. Basically, the trader looks at position size in multiples of three. This
means that there are several tactics for position size using this rule:
All In: This tactic is when the trader places three lots at one time on a
binary option contract.



==================================================
                     PAGE 183                     
==================================================

182 Trading Binary Options
Partially In: This tactic is when the trader places a sequence of lots, one
at a time.
Another risk-control approach, which is particularly important to traders
of the offshore hi-low binaries, is not to risk more than 2 percent of equity
on any binary option trade. Using this rule will clearly convey to traders that
larger accounts are in fact safer. The reason larger accounts are safer is that a
trader with a small account tends to put on more lots to generate a cash goal.
She forgets the percentage risk she is taking on each trade. Getting out under
the rule of three provides the following choices:
All Out: Closing all the positions.
Legging Out: Closing one or two positions during the week.
A critical question is: When do you place more lots on? As indicated
earlier, it’s not that easy a question to answer. Certainly one answer is to place
more lots on when the trader has a high level of confidence with the position
working out. But that confidence ultimately has to be based on a record of
results. When starting out, there is no basis to be confident about your own
level of confidence! Be patient because it takes more time. Another approach
is based on the fear factor. Does the trader have a high risk tolerance and
no fear of entirely losing the position? For example, a deep-in-the-money
$85 option on Wednesday or Thursday may seem like a sure bet, but the risk
is losing it all. Are you prepared to do so? Many beginning traders are trading
with capital they really don’t want to risk. A scenario that justifies higher risk
is a situation in which the trader has built up some profits and at the end of
the week or month is really risking the profits generated and not the principal.
The time of the week provides a rubric for risk control, especially for
traders of binary ladders. An $80 binary option price on Monday is far riskier
than an $80 binary option trade on Thursday. There is more time on Monday
for things to go wrong. Conversely, a $25 binary option trade on Monday has
less risk than a $25 binary option play on a Thursday. There is more time for
things to go right! The high return pays off if new information surprises the
market. Ultimately, it is a balance between fear and greed.
Offsetting Trades: Failing Forward
What about risk control when the markets are going the other way and
the open positions are not working out? The scenario might be familiar to
many: a position you believed would work out great is just out of energy

and will not settle in-the-money. The result is a $0 payout and total loss of
the position. The way to reduce the impact of this loss is to view the loss as a
contra-directional signal. In other words, leave the position alone, and go the
other way by putting on a position that goes with the market expectations
either in the same underlying market or in a correlated one. This amounts to
switching horses in the middle of the rate. The problem with this approach
is more emotion than meets the eye. Traders tend to marry their positions
and get attached to the ego factor in being right. Switching, to these traders,
means admitting they are wrong. Yet, it’s important to realize that the market
doesn’t care if the trader is right or wrong!
Leverage and Margin
Risk control is helped because of the fact that in binary option trading there
is no margin. The amount traded cannot exceed the amount of cash in the
account. A $10,000 account cannot have more than $10,000 purchased. If
a trader is selling a $15 binary option with a bet that the strike price will not
go above a certain level, the account will require that $85 be set aside to hold
that position. Therefore, the most that can be risked, $85, is the amount of
the margin calculated. It doesn’t matter if there is a resting order. The tactical
implications are relevant when the trader is putting on a large position, such
as 50 lots. As soon as it is put on, the Nadex exchange or IG will consider the
total margin to be calculated as if the entire position is filled. A working posi-
tion, therefore, has the same margin requirements as a filled position.

Metrics for Improving
Binary Trading
Performance
Evolving and improving your trading performance for binary options
requires an ongoing commitment to evaluate one’s own performance. Up to
this point, this book has navigated through many strategies and tactics for
trading binaries. The challenge is whether you have improved your skills. This
chapter reviews key performance metrics that can guide you as you evolve
your trading.
Key Performance Metrics
There are many variables involved in such evaluations. The following are
some useful categories to keep in mind.
Win/Loss Ratio
As discussed earlier, the ability to become profitable is really a two-part
equation. All levels of profitability ultimately relate to a win/loss ratio and an
average profit/average loss ratio. The result is a personalized profitability curve
that describes whether the trader is profitable and whether the trader is stable
in maintaining profitability. Ask yourself after conducting a series of trades
(10 or more): What does my profitability curve look like?

Adjusted Win/Loss Ratio
Ask yourself, what would happen to your performance if you removed from
the calculation the best-winning and the worst-losing trade? This is called
the adjusted win/loss ratio and adjusted average gain/average loss. It suggests
a more realistic performance result than the original win/loss and average
gain/average loss ratios. Don’t be fooled by one great trade or one great loss.
It’s the adjusted win/loss ratio that is more indicative of your actual core
skill level.
Near-Miss Ratio
In binaries, if you win by just the smallest margin, you are a winner and the
same goes for losing by the smallest margin. This is why it is a good idea to
measure how big your wins and losses are. If you win by large margins, then
your confidence in the strategy you used can be reliable. If you lose by large
margins, you can consider it a clue to improve your strategy. Therefore, count
the near misses as a percentage of the win/loss ratio. The goal is to have as few
as possible near misses and bigger size wins.
Distance from Breakeven
When all is said and done, it’s about profitability. The goal, however, of getting
profitable first requires getting beyond the breakeven point. A breakeven score
is a very significant milestone. It means the trader is very close to profitability.
Perhaps, it may be only a few changes, and profitability becomes more com-
mon. What is the key to breaking the breakeven barrier? It is consistency. The
trader who is consistently wrong can at least identify one or two reasons for
the performance problems. A trader who is flipping from profits to losses has
a more difficult ability to diagnose the causes of their losses. Understanding
the stability of your trading record is a key piece of information. What is the
risk of ruin? What is the risk of losing your profits? Is it coming from one or
two bad trades, or is it related to a strategy?
A first approach in evaluating one’s performance and your risk exposure
to losses is to determine how many trades it takes to break even (Figure 10.1).
Another way to look at this is to understand that the path to profits must
first cross the breakeven barrier. The following table shows costs per trade,
maximum profit per trade, and maximum loss per trade (Table 10.1). For

each combination of these three, there is a number of winning trades it takes
to reach a breakeven point. In other words, any number less means that the
trade is not profitable. For example, if a trader buys a $95 binary option, it
will take 19 winners to offset one $95 loser!

Win/Loss Duration
Over time, each trader develops a personalized pattern and style of trading.
There are patterns within the winning trades, as well as the losing trades, that
provide important clues on how to improve performance. The duration of the
trade is a key metric. How long is your average time in a winning trade? How
long is your average time in a losing trade? This will tell you a great deal about
your psychological profile as a trader. If you are a set-and-let trader, you will
have long duration trades. If you are on the other side of the trader-style con-
tinuum, you will have short trades, revealing a frenetic trading personality.
It’s important to note that there is no good or bad connotation with your
trading personality; it is a clue as to how to improve your trading. What is
also important is a change in your style. If the distribution of your trades
shows trade duration all over the place (multi-modal), it indicates you are
either a very diversified or a very confused trader!
Trading Sequence Patterns
Every trader has winning and losing streaks. It’s part of the game. However,
each trader has his or her own maximum winning and losing streaks in his or
her trading history. This tells you a great deal. If you are near your previous
maximum winning streak, it’s a good idea to be careful, because you’re at a
high probability of ending that streak. Winning streaks are more than just
being right about the market—they are also about your total mind-set and
emotional intelligence in trading. Near the end of a winning streak, traders
get overconfident, overzealous, and start making strategic and technical mis-
takes. Likewise, into a losing streak, each loss wears on the trader and affects
judgments as to the next trade.
Another aspect of trading-sequence patterns that is important to note and
review is the sequence of win, lose, win, lose. This sequence shows difficulty
in performance, and may become a precursor to the beginning of a losing
streak.
Strategy Scorecard
Binary option trading performance is not only a statistical outcome, it is a
result of using strategies. This means that any performance review can be
evaluated from a strategy point of view. The best way to do this is to dis-
tribute your trading results by the five main strategies used: at-the-money
(ATM), out-of-the-money (OTM), deep-out-of-the-money (DOOM),



==================================================

Metrics for Improving Binary Trading Performance 189
in-the-money (ITM), and deep-in-the-money (DITM). Look at your
trading history and determine which are your best and worst trades from a
strategy point of view.
YOUR PERFORMANCE SCORECARD
To help you eff ectively evaluate your binary option trading performance, you can
use a binary option trader scorecard as a key tool. It reviews your trading history
and produces a report card on key parameters of your performance. Go to www
.binarydimensions.com for more details.
Performance Challenges
A static backward-looking review of your binary option trading performance
is useful but it’s really only a fi rst step to moving ahead. Th e next part of the
process of evaluating your performance is by testing your results on a forward-
looking, real-time basis. Th is means planning and putting on trades with a
strategy in mind. Th ink of it as a training schedule for a binary option trading
marathon. It is a fast track to improved performance because binary option
trading is not a game of chance. Th e probability of improving performance is
related to your skills and not the market.
Each performance challenge tests a core binary option trading skill. Ulti-
mately, the trader will discover his or her strengths and choose strategies that
play to that skill.
Th ere is no single strategy that applies to everyone. Each trader applies
his or her own personality to the trading and only after many trades can a real
trading plan emerge. Until that happens, the trader needs to look at his or her
own trading as a self-improvement path to obtain trading fi tness.
When completed, the results of these exercises will provide you the
equivalent of a blood test of your binary option trading skills. Th e size of the
account doesn’t matter. A trader can do one challenge over one week or take
more time. It is important to have a big enough account to place trades at a
frequency that gives the trader exposure to changing market conditions. One
trade a week won’t take the sample frequency to a level suffi cient to evaluate
with any forecast accuracy. So it will take a balance of size and frequency. Con-
sider the following list of performance challenges for laddered binary trading.

1. Ten ATM Trades: The challenge here is to see how good you are in
timing entry. ATM trades are essentially momentum-based trades.
2. Ten ITM Trades: The challenge here is to join the crowd after confirming
a strong trend direction. The ITM trades cost more than $75. This makes
it more important to be right more often. The risk is that one or two
poor trades can wipe out your gains.
3. Ten OTM Trades: If you are a contrarian, OTM trades are for you.
They are low cost, about $15 to $30, but they pay out very large returns.
The key skill here is to understand price patterns signaling a breakout or
reversal. The trader is essentially betting against the crowd.
4. Ten DOOM Trades: Deep-out-of-the-money strategies are appropriately
named DOOM. It’s for high rollers who buy $10 to $20 ask prices. The
key is, what is your mathematics of performance? Are you on the right
side of your profitability curve? The mission here is to find out.
5. Ten DITM Trades: Deep-in-the-money trades are high-probability
wins, but there is a high cost to being wrong. The real challenge is to see
how good you really are at spotting a stable trend continuation.
6. Ten Gut Trades: Gut trades are trades based on the blink effect. This
is to quickly scan the markets and make an instinctive judgment about
direction. This exercise is designed to help avoid paralysis-by-analysis
syndrome. Don’t overanalyze. This exercise will often provide a
benchmark for your emotional intelligence.
7. Ten Headline Trades: Look at the headlines in the Financial Times,
Google, and Bloomberg and use your sentiment-assessment skills to find
the right trading direction.
8. Ten Contrarian Trades: In this performance challenge, the task is to
deliberately go against the crowd. The crucial question is: When is the
crowd wrong?
9. Ten Bounce Trades: Try to find sideways channels, and put on trades
anticipating a failure to break through both resistance and support.
10. Ten Breakout Trades: Try to find a sideways channel and put on a pair
of binary trades that anticipate a breakdown of support or a breakout of
resistance.
11. Ten Data Release Trades: Specifically locate the economic calendar for
an important data release, such as the non-farm payroll or a key central
bank report. Put on a binary play on the day of the release with a 50 percent
profit-taking target.
12. Thirty Mixed-Strategy Trades: After you have done the first 11 strategy
tests, look at the results and pick out the three best strategies and put on

30 trades (yes, three times the usual number), testing with 10 trades for
each of the three best strategies.
13. Ten Directional Trades: On the U.S. market opening, watch the S&P
500 and based on its direction, trade the same direction on the USD/
JPY. On the Shanghai Opening, watch the Shanghai Index and on the
direction of the opening, trade the same direction on the AUD/USD.
Watch the direction of U.S. crude (WTI) and trade the USD/CAD in
the opposite direction.
These performance challenges are designed to provide milestones for
evolving as a binary option trader. The results of each performance chal-
lenge set provide important data to assess strengths and weaknesses. Go to
www.binarydimensions.com for more performance challenges and to sub-
mit your results.
Performance Challenges for Trading High-low Binaries
For binary option traders trading platforms that offer only the high-low type
of trades, the following performance challenges will help test your skills.
1. For one-minute binary expirations, turn on one-minute three-line break
charts and trade when you see a reversal of colors.
2. For five-minute binary expirations, wait for a parabolic curve to be
formed and trade the opposite direction once it reaches a peak and then
starts reversing. Trade a 15-minutes expiration.
3. For a 30-minute binary expiration, locate an underlying market that has
a sideways range of about 30 pips and place a double Bollinger Band on
it. Wait for the price to reach the outer band and then reverse. Then put
a 30-minute expiration on the direction of the reversal.
analytical Challenges
While putting on trades is ultimately the best form of testing your skills, it’s
important to also challenge your analytical abilities. The following analytical
challenges are evergreen. They do not go out of date and can be done anytime.
• What is the sentiment of the market regarding the U.S. dollar (DXY)? Is it
risk averse or risk appetite, and why?

• Scan the binary option underlying markets for markets that just reached
new weekly highs. What is the reason for the new highs?
• Among the floating currencies, what are the widest interest-rate differen-
tials?
• What is your adjusted win/loss ratio (remove the highest gain and the high-
est loss, and then recompute the result)?
• Scan the four-hour charts of the underlying markets and select one that
has a compressed triangle forming. Put on a breakout trade around that
triangle.
• On Thursday, 10 a.m. EST, find three different underlying binary trade
option strike prices that are being offered at $75 and put one lot on each to
test the strategy of going with the crowd.
• Find the underlying market that hit new weekly lows. What is the reason
for the new lows?
• Compare the S&P 500, Shanghai Composite Index, and on their past
three-month performance. Which pair is the most divergent?
• On the next Wednesday, choose three underlying markets and find the
ATM bid/ask. Choose the one that is most likely, in your opinion, to go
from ATM to ITM and place a trade with a 50 percent profit limit.
• Find two underlying markets that have had a very narrow sideways channel
in the past month. Place a breakout trade on each market.
• Conduct a review of headlines on the U.S. dollar and develop your own
risk appetite/risk aversion sentiment ratio.
• Locate and review the nonfarm payroll jobless claims data and determine if
there is a trend up or down in the data.
• Determine on the economic calendar when the next Tankan report is
coming out.
• Do a scan of the currency pairs and evaluate their three-line break patterns.
Which pair has just experienced a three-line break reversal using the one-
week chart?
• Which of the underlying markets are experiencing a sideways one-week
channel?
• Find the appropriate ETF for the underlying market and locate the
at-the-money put/call ratio. Is it skewing to the bearish or the bullish side?
• Look at the gold/oil ratio. Is it at an extreme?
• Check the Shanghai Index and overlay it against the AUD/USD. Try to
predict next week’s direction.
• Go to the central bank of Switzerland (www.snb.ch) and read their
monetary policy. Find out when was the last time they raised interest
rates.

Know Your Trading Personality
Part of the evolution of success in getting better at binary option trading is to
understand your own trader personality. Th e fact is it is impossible to separate
emotions from the trade. Th is is a fact of life and the challenge is to recognize
one’s own personality. Th is will help limit your risks by associating the trad-
ing strategy that calibrates to your personality. Th ere are several personality
types and the fi eld of psychological fi nance is devoting a lot of work to mod-
eling emotions and how they become translated into the traits of a trader. In
fact, an entire new fi eld called c omputational psychology and artifi cial chemistry
is focused on mapping how emotions result in behavior. A good place to
start to detect your trading personality is to consider which of the following
archetypes best calibrates with you.
Th e Gladiator/Samurai— Th is person loves to trade even more than
winning or losing. Being in the action is the objective. We call
them the gladiator-type because gladiators had no fear of death and
focused on the battle itself. A gladiator-type of binary option trader
has the advantage of being committed to the trade without being
frenetic about the result. Th e disadvantage of this personality is that
it can lead to overtrading and unnecessary losses. Few gladiators
survive for long!
Th e Warrior— Th is personality type loves trading but really wants to win.
He avoids trades that are not highly probable and has no allegiance to
any one market. Th is type of personality is comfortable with a mixed
binary option strategy, each one being a diff erent weapon of choice.

                     PAGE 194                     
==================================================

194 Trading Binary Options
The Gunslinger/Surfer—He or she acts upon an emotional or gut
feeling to enter or exit a trade. This type of personality often likes
to surf and jump from one trading opportunity to another. At-the-
money, momentum-type strategies attract this personality.
The Sniper—Analyzes the market and takes the trade only when the
market moves on the conditions they have specified. This trading
style is similar to swing trading or waiting for a key support or
resistance level to be tested. Many people do not have the patience,
or the wisdom, to be a sniper-trader. This type favors breakout
trades that provide out-of-the-money pricing.
The Lamb—This type of trader reacts to market moves by running with
the crowd. When a lot of such traders come into the market, they add
energy to the momentum of the prices, creating a contagion. Deep-
in-the-money binary option trades are favored by this personality.
The Black Sheep—The trading behavior of this personality is contrarian.
This type of trader doesn’t join the crowd and seeks an opposite
opportunity. It takes courage to be a black sheep. But when the
black sheep is right, profits are very large.
The Gambler—This person’s attitude toward trading is similar to that
of a gambler. The motivation is not to seek a profitable return. The
trader is in it as a search for excitement at the moment. He or she is
not distressed by losses.
The Eagle—This type of trader scans multiple markets and multiple
time frames to determine best possible trading opportunity. The
Eagle trader is a predator that is in impulsive.
The Donkey—The donkey trader experiences consecutive losses and
doesn’t change the strategy. He or she is stubborn like a mule.
Self-examination of one’s own trading personality will provide many
insights that can improve your results. Very often, the critical weakness
facing the binary option trader is not a lack of technical, or fundamental
analysis, but a lack of being aware of the psycho-dynamics relating to the
trade.
Targeting Total returns
Trading performance can be viewed on a trade-by-trade basis, but it can also
be viewed from total-return perspective. This later approach is more a top-
down approach and, in fact, makes a huge difference on how each trade is



==================================================
                     PAGE 195                     
==================================================

Metrics for Improving Binary Trading Performance 195
viewed. The bottom-up approach looks at each trade as its own self-contained
opportunity. In contrast, the top-down approach views each trade as a com-
ponent toward a total return per week or per month. Each trade is, meta-
phorically, a component in a trading factory. The question arises: What’s the
production of the factory for each week or month—in terms of total return.
There are different ways to approach binary option trading from a total
return perspective, and all are legitimate because they reflect the belief that trad-
ers have varying goals. Some traders seek the opportunity to put on a position
for a very high return. These traders are high rollers, with large risk appetites.
This kind of trader searches for binary contracts that offer the opportunity to
pay out a $100 on a risk of $20 (therefore delivering 5:1 returns in less than a
week). In contrast, the other group of traders is looking for high-probability
returns. For them, binary option contracts that cost $75 and higher are often
attractive. They offer less reward, but have a higher probability of success.
Whether one trades for high returns or high probability, there are two
distinctive total return perspectives. You can view binary options on a trade-
by-trade basis and enjoy the experience. An analogy would be doing a round
of golf, but not keeping score. Another approach is a total return portfolio
approach. This means using binary options as a mechanism for achieving a
total-return goal.
The total-return approach, in effect, reverses the process of shaping the
binary option trade. Instead of starting with a scan of the market and identi-
fying price patterns and opportunities, the trader starts by setting total return
portfolio goals. This approach is a manufacturing model. It views traders as
managers of a manufacturing process that produces profits per year, month,
and week. Here are three questions that help you shape a binary option port-
folio return plan. Ultimately, all total-return strategies can become translated
into how you answer these questions.
1. What is your total return goal for a year?
2. What is your total return goal for a month?
3. What is your total return goal for a week?
For example, a 50-percent total return for one year of trading is a result
that is not only admirable, but that places one among the better traders in the
world. This results in a 4.1 percent return per month, or just over 1 percent
a week. Having shaped a performance goal for the week, the next step is to
develop a set of binary option trading strategies that contribute to that objec-
tive. Here is an example, in Table 10.2, of one week’s trades that resulted in a
1 percent return for the week.

The 1 percent-per-week results would be competitive with any world-
class manager, but by using the binary option trading tools, they are within
the reach of ordinary persons. The example represents a sample set of trades,
but it is still instructive. What can we learn from it? First, that binary option
trading strategies are not a single pure strategy. The trades represent a combi-
nation of deep-in-the-money trades, at-the-money, and breakout trades. Of
course, there are many combinations possible. Only after conducting a large
number of trades per strategy can the best personal mixed strategy for any
trader be developed.
Let’s look at a possible combination set of trades or recipe that would
result in a 1 percent return for the week (Figure 10.2). In reality, there are
many ways to accomplish this, but it is suggestive of what it takes. The inputs
are trades, and the trades result in a total cost. The output, if profitable, should
be enough winners with big enough size wins to result in a net profit. In a real
sense this is a recipe for a 1 percent weekly total return for a $10,000 account.
The results of the preceding hypothetical two-strategy combination pro-
vide insights into the challenges for the trader. Returns of 1 percent per week
are the kind of return potential that no one should ignore. Let’s consider the
mathematics of profitability using this combination. The deep-in-the-money
strategy needs to be 80 percent effective, and the deep-out-of-the-money
strategy needs to be 60 percent effective. The results are sensitive to the cost
of entry, of course. But you get the idea.

11 Winners = $150 Profit Approximately 1.5%
While the example refers to a 1 percent return, the binary option mar-
ket can in fact result in much larger returns. For example, during the week
of June 25 to 29, global markets moved greatly. Almost any binary option
strategy worked very well for that week. The lesson is that when markets
move in a synchronous direction and the trader is on the right side of the
direction, enormous returns are possible. These results also point to the power
of a mixed strategy. It provides a recipe for a variety of total return targets.
It places trading strategy as a tool for accomplishing a goal, and not just a
particular trade. But before a trader can effectively build and hone a binary
option trading strategy, she must know how to evaluate her own trading
performance.

Chapter 11
Performance Tools and
Training for Improving
Binary Option Trading
This chapter provides guidance on how to move beyond a beginner’s level in
binary trading. As the binary trading industry has grown, so has the number
of robot programs and advisory services. We review key features of algorithmic
trading and other performance aids such as alerts and trading competitions.
Algorithmic Trading: Is It for You?
Algorithmic trading defines sets of rules that determine the entry and exit
points for positions. Automation of these rules helps traders achieve con-
sistent returns while limiting both risk and emotion. Developing a system
to trade binary options is not easy, but it is certainly a tool of the future. A
binary trading and alert algorithm is now being developed using these prin-
ciples and will soon be part of the binary options toolbox.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Automated Trading
Algorithmic trading, or automated trading, has several benefits, but it also has
downsides. In fact, at this juncture in the evolution of technical analysis and
trading, there is an ongoing debate. On one side are the “click traders,” who
make trades using their human instincts and intelligence. On the other side are

the “bot traders,” that are systems that trade at a high frequency. It is now esti-
mated that 70 percent of trades are system-based. We don’t know who will win
the battle, but at this point, the human trader is behind in volume. However, it
is arguable if systems can, in fact, replace the trader. In any case, binary options
will become an area in which systems and alerts will be developed and offered.
It is relevant to explore this area a bit further. Let’s compare the main advantages
and disadvantages of binary option trading on an algorithmic-based system.
The main advantages are:
• An automated approach takes the emotion and manual effort out of
trading. This allows you to focus on improving your approach, rule sets,
and money-management rules.
• A profitable system requires no work until it breaks, or market conditions
demand a change. All systems go through cycles of good and bad. This
is expected, but a time will come when the approach fails to recover and
needs to be reviewed and redesigned.
And the main disadvantages are:
• If the system is not properly developed and tested, losses can happen very
quickly and wipe out your confidence and trading account. This is par-
ticularly true for binary options, as binary options are a relatively recent
development.
• Many times it is impossible to take into account every intricate rule you see
while watching the screen.
We can see that it’s useful to carefully review whether the algorithm-based
system one has in mind reflects more of the advantages or disadvantages. Let’s
review the elements in developing such a system.
Developing a Trading System
There are several important steps involved in developing a binary option trading
system: get the highest quality data, develop rules, test those rules, test in real
time, and trade in a real account. This section discusses each step in closer detail.
Get the Data
All systems are developed and optimized against historical data. In every case,
and with every system, data is king. A bad approach with questionable data



==================================================
                     PAGE 200                     
==================================================

Performance Tools and Training for Improving Binary Option Trading 201
could test fantastic but implode in real-time trading because you set param-
eters based on bad trade data. A great approach tested on bad data could test
fantastic and implode in real trading for the same reason. So, you have to get
the highest quality data possible.
Develop the Rules
There are four basic rules for every trading system:
1. Buy Entry: Where you want to open a new long position.
2. Sell Entry: Where you want to open a new short position.
3. Stop Loss: Where you want to cut your losses and exit the position.
4. Profit Target: Where you want to book your profits.
Every system uses some combination of these basic rules. For binaries,
a sample rule for the EUR/USD may be: when the 21-day moving average
of the underlying EUR/USD spot crosses the 50-day moving average of the
EUR/USD spot—buy an at-the-money call option. (Note: This is only an
example and not a suggested rule.)
The key to remember is that almost any indicator and trading rule that
you currently use can be used within a trading system. The most important
aspect is clarifying exactly what trading rule you want. It has to be quantifiable.
Test the Rules
Testing is a key step in the development of any approach. After you
develop your rules, you need to start testing. Testing is not simply operat-
ing the algorithm and generating the results. Rather, it requires patience
and structure.
Caution: Testing can create a false sense of security. You can minimize this
by what is called, in-sample testing and out-of-sample testing.
In simple terms, you split your data into two parts. The first part, the in-
sample data set, is designated for your base testing. You need to experiment
with different combinations and take careful notes on the outcome of each
test. From this work, you should arrive at rules, stop loss, and profit targets
that produce the most consistent results.
Then take this rule set and test it against your out-of-sample data set.
Hopefully, if you have been careful in your rules, note taking, and combina-
tion selection, you should achieve similar results for your in-sample and out-
of-sample testing.

==================================================

202 Trading Binary Options
Test in Real Time
After you have developed and tested your system against historical data, it’s
time to put it to the real test and run it against real-time data. This is a
critical step for a lot of reasons. First, it gives you peace of mind before you
risk capital and it enhances the probability for account preservation. Second,
back-testing doesn’t provide a test of the real-world transaction environment
in which there may be variations in the spread and in the ability to fill trades.
It’s a good idea to first set up a real-time test with a demo account, as long as
the demo account is receiving real-time live quotes. As you watch the system
trade, ensure the system acts and trades as expected and verify that it’s trad-
ing as it did in all your previous testing. It’s also important to determine the
resources the algorithm or system will need to perform well.
Moving to a Live Account
The move to a live account is the biggest leap. However, at this point, you
have developed and tested a set of rules and verified them against a live
market. You are as prepared as you can be to put your approach to the test.
There are two basic methods for bringing the fruits of your labor live:
1. Semi-Automated: Semi-automated systems alert you when new trades are
triggered. While the alerts are automated, the trades are not automatically
placed. While this method carries less risk, there are downsides: (1) it
requires you to be available to execute the trade when triggered, and (2),
it allows your emotion to question the validity of the trade.
2. Fully Automated: Automated systems place trades in your account
automatically and require no intervention on your part. There are risks.
However, if you have taken the time to test the automated system in a demo
account, you should have some added confidence in the execution and results.
In all cases, it is important to remember that you are still ultimately in
control. If the system starts to implode or strays outside your testing bound-
aries, turn it off and regroup. Tomorrow is another day.
Evolving Your Approach
This is a brief walk-through of the basic steps involved for creating an
automated trading system. There are entire books and a variety of sources
written on the topic. There are also numerous professionals who can help
turn your vision into reality.

                     PAGE 202                     
==================================================

Performance Tools and Training for Improving Binary Option Trading 203
As you continue to evolve your approach and system, keep these keys in
mind: back-test, redesign, back-test, and back-test some more. If your system
does not perform on historical data, there is no reason it will perform well on
real-time data.
Once it trades well on historical data, run it long enough to vali-
date that it’s trading correctly on real-time data. Testing against years of
historical data, then testing it in real time for a week is not validation. If
your back-test encompassed 1,000 trades, test in real time until you see
100 trades.
Keep it simple. Extremely complex trading approaches often work
extremely well with past data, but are too brittle for real-time market
conditions.
Most importantly, know the strategy behind your trading system. As
strange as it sounds, many people develop approaches, add bits and pieces,
and eventually lose sight of their underlying strategy.
Using Alerts
Another method for trying to enhance one’s binary option performance
is to use alerts. Alerts can be automatic signals that indicate a buy or sell
opportunity. Binary alerts can also specify which expiration should be used
with the buy or sell alert. For example, momentum trades should be associ-
ated with next or expirations of relatively short periods, such as five minutes
and 30 minutes. The challenge for automatic alerts that have emerged in the
global market is that they are usually based on simplistic methods that have
not really been proven.
A better alternative is to select an alert service that is offered by a trading
expert. My newsletter site, www.binarydimensions.com, offers weekly binary
option alerts and analysis on a Monday morning for Friday expiration. A
separate alert service is also offered, as is trading China A50 on the Nadex
exchange. These are weekly, daily, and intraday expirations. The China A50
track and the Shanghai Index offer an opportunity to trade the China market
at night, after 9 p.m. EST. These alerts provide a basis for learning how to
trade laddered binaries as well as gaining insight into predicted directions for
the coming week. The following 100 percent winning binary alert recently
occurred, demonstrating that extraordinary returns per week are possible
with binary options (Table 11.1).

Algo Alerts Trading Competitions
An emerging method for improving one’s binary option trading is social trad-
ing. In social trading, a trader watches other traders and tries to copy their
trades. An effective learning experience using social trading is trading com-
petitions. This allows a trader to test one’s skills in a trading contest. Some
brokerage firms offer contests, mostly however, as a marketing gimmick to
attract an account. In contrast, the site’s unique opportunity allows traders to
trade real binary option markets of various durations in a virtual account for
prizes. Traders play a variety of challenges (best trader of the day, most con-
secutive winners, and so forth). Prizes are offered along with education. The
platform is free and advanced educational opportunities are offered as well.
Competitions require a minimal entry fee, such as $10.

Afterword
My hope with this book is that binary options becomes understood as a pow-
erful tool for trading for beginners and experienced persons. The coming
years will see greater than ever integration of global markets with instant and
often emotional responses augmented by the Internet. As a result, fundamen-
tal forces that often took months to evolve and surface have greater salience
than ever. In this context, binary options provide the trader the ability to
navigate these increasingly volatile waters every week.
Good luck trading!

Trading Binary Options: Strategies and Tactics, Second Edition

Appendix B:
More Training Tools
and Tests
The focus of this book’s appendices is to allow you to test your knowledge
of the concepts and strategies covered in this book and to know where to go
for more information. Of course, the best form of knowledge is experiential.
There is no substitute for putting on trades. However, with binary option
trading tools and training, the evolution toward profitable trading is more
probable.
Since binary option trading is new, at this time there are few tools that
are available to the trader to help improve his or her trading. In response to
the lack of trading tools, a binary option trading toolbox has been created. It
includes a unique one-stop place for apps relating to binary option trading.
These include:
Online fundamental and technical checklists: Traders will be able
to access numerous detailed checklists that provide a step-by-step
approach for evaluating over 20 different underlying markets.
For every underlying market there are technical and fundamental
analysis checklists and trading tips!
Binary trading education modules: These modules provide an
evolutionary path from beginner to advanced stages of trading binary
options. They include learning management systems that pace the
trader through the modules and test their skills and knowledge.
Trade of the Week: Real trading examples of winning binary option
trades by real traders. This allows learning by example.
Coaching: One-on-one coaching for traders looking for intense trading.
Education webinars: Webinars and special expert appearances by
leading binary option traders.
