Foreword
I met Brian Twomey about fi ve years ago when he came to my offi ce here in
North Carolina for a day visit. What immediately struck me about Brian
was his “fi re-in-the-belly” spirit and go-getter attitude. Brian impressed me
with his knowledge of the markets as well as his outstanding analytical prow-
ess. We’ve kept in touch over the years and I was honored to be contacted by
Brian’s publisher for the purpose of writing this foreword.
For anybody interested in trading or studying the Forex markets, I would
consider this book required reading. I was astounded at the level of detail,
especially in terms of the nation-by-nation analyses that is provided. Detailed
methodologies, trade strategies, a terrifi c chapter devoted exclusively to the
Libor, and an extensive analysis of currency pairs are also discussed.
At the book’s conclusion, Brian explains “My purpose for this book was
to address all the various issues involved that comprise a currency pair not
only from a strict trading perspective but to bring an understanding from a
whole host of perspectives.” I believe that Brian has achieved this objective
tenfold. I predict that this book will serve as an important reference resource
for all those interested in the inner workings of world currencies.
I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did.

Preface
This book answers the question what are the components, the constituent
factors that comprise the second side of a currency-pair equation and how
should those factors be considered in terms of a trade strategy. A currency
pair comprises two sides, a two-nation perspective. In order to understand a
currency-pair combination, both sides of the pair must be considered from
the two-nation perspective.
The two-nation perspective was fully outlined in this text with not only
the trader in mind but researchers, market professionals, and present and
future students of the markets.
The genesis of the book framework was derived from the many biases
I saw over the years from the academic journals, trader publications, or years
of prior books. Each book, each article, and each journal publication offered a
point, an insight that would help the reader further his or her knowledge. But
each publication taught a perspective, an insight that would eventually lead to
the overall understanding of the two-nation operational framework. Yet years
may pass before the full learned concepts could actually become operational
in a trade strategy and understanding of the market due to the proper knowledge
never advanced in one publication. Publications had biases, toward the U.S.
dollar side of the currency-pair equation, with no consideration of the second
part of the pair.
Spot-currency prices move in the markets based on factors of interest
rates but interest rates between two nations rather than one side of a currency
pair. The question must then be asked: How does the second nation calcu-
late and factor interest, and what market instruments are available to track
the various rates that trade every day in the markets in order to track a trade
throughout the various markets?
To trade Australian dollar/Japanese yen, one must understand Japanese
TIBOR and Euroyen rates in terms of bank bills and Overnight Cash Rates
in Australia. To trade U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar, one must know the U.S.
Fed funds rates in relation to Canada’s CORRA and OMMFR interest rates.

xii Preface
How those specifi c interest rates trade and direction of their movements can
have profound effects on currency-pair prices.
This book sets out to outline the two-sided currency-pair trade from a
whole host of perspectives as it relates nation to nation. It addresses currency
pairs from the eight major nations because that is where the vast majority of
trade occurs.
Chapter One is an outline of the Triennial Survey released every three
years by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS). While that is not new to
any publication, the historical surveys are addressed and analyzed so readers
can understand the historical composition of the market in its proper context
as well as the rise of many varied currency pairs and fi nancial instruments
associated with the historical rise of the markets.
Beside the Triennial surveys, the BIS offers annual and quarterly reviews
of the currency markets and each is addressed in terms of the specifi cs of the
markets, types of topics addressed, and factors for consideration to under-
stand and evaluate the market.
Foreign-exchange committees formed in the late 1970s and mimic the
work of the BIS. Each nation has an FX Committee, but that commit-
tee is specifi c to the nation of trade. Each nation’s FX Committee is fully
highlighted.
Chapter Two offers foundation and theories of money and interest. It
begins with a historical perspective and answers such questions as supply
and demand of money from an operational framework, always highlighted
nation by nation. Historically, the demand and supply of money begins with
the classical theorist, moves into Keynes, Von Hayek, and Milton Friedman.
Theories and perspectives of Purchasing Power Parity are explored in fi ne
detail.
Chapter Three explores trade weight indices from a whole host of per-
spectives: historical, methodological, index composition, and theories of
composition from an economic perspective. Each nation is addressed specifi -
cally in terms of formulas, calculations, currency composition, and economic
framework, and trade strategies are explained in detail.
Chapter Four begins the open-market valuation and knowledge of inter-
est rates and currency-pair prices from the perspective of repurchase agree-
ments. Each nation is addressed specifi cally due to the many factors nations
consider as they approach their open-market operations. Repo rates establish
a fl oor for interest, yet interest rates rise and fall with markets and economic
conditions. Each nation is addressed in all its minute detail to fully under-
stand the operational framework of repurchase-agreement markets.

==================================================

Preface xiii
Chapter Five addresses the most important of open-market interest rates,
LIBOR. LIBOR is explained, addressed, and highlighted not only from the
well-known British Bankers Association perspective but each nation has its
own LIBOR. Each nation’s LIBOR is fully explained in terms of factors
of interest rates and what moves currency pair prices associated with those
LIBOR rates, and historical views are addressed to the best of my ability.
Many currency-pair chart examples accompany each nation’s LIBOR so readers
can fully understand each nation’s LIBOR and factors of currency-pair move-
ments and prices.
Chapter Six addresses yield curves fi rst from their historical per-
spective then each nation’s yield curve is explained and calculated with
bond examples and historical perspectives offered. The U.S. market is
the most important of the four, so currency-pair chart examples accom-
pany yield curve charts. Factors such as how to trade yield curves are also
fully highlighted.
Chapter Seven moves further along the interest-rate curve to address
swaps in all their various forms from currency swaps, cross-currency basis
swaps, and overnight interest-rate swaps. Each nation’s swap market is high-
lighted specifi cally due to the varied nuances of every market. The chapter
then moves into outright forwards and forward points. Formulas and cal-
culated examples are offered. A forward point calculated example includes a
yield curve and spot price calculated to a forward point.
Chapter Eight addresses stock markets as they relate to currency prices
and the bond/yield interplay. Each nation’s stock market is discussed in terms
of time of trade, formulas of each nation’s stock market, factors for trade con-
sideration, and relationship to bonds and yields in each market.
Chapter Nine addresses currency-pair conversions, volatility and volatil-
ity indicators, formulas, and calculated examples as they relate to currency
pairs. A full discussion of volatility is offered not only for currency pairs, but
currency options are addressed. Futures contracts in terms of standard versus
micro contracts are discussed and fully addressed in terms of currency-pair
prices and conversions.
Chapter Ten offers technical indicators, ready-made indicators employed
to evaluate trade decisions. Simple moving averages, Bollinger Bands,
Ichimoku, and pivot points are addressed due to features specifi c to the mar-
kets. Ichimoku is vital to the Japanese and Asian currency markets since it is
not only widely employed but its operational framework must be understood
in order to trade Asian markets. Bollinger Bands is important to volatility,
simple moving averages to means, and pivot points to support and resistance.

xiv Preface
Simple moving averages go a step further, as a simple moving average is
converted into a volatility indicator. Trend lines are discussed in all their fi ner
details and histories offered. Volume and open interest studies, COT reports,
correlations, and the Baltic Exchange is offered due to its importance to the
commodity currencies such as Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar, and
Canadian dollar.

CHAPTER 1
Foreign Exchange
Reports
Foreign exchange (FX) reports are market-intelligence documents that comprise
many facets. Bank reports for example address direct and sometimes short-term
market variables such as a short- or long-term trade, a possible central bank
interest rate change, or economic variable that directly relates to the market.
Institutional reports address bigger-picture issues that comprise market
intelligence in terms of overall trading volume, types of instruments traded,
and a fundamental or technical aspect that must be addressed in order for the
market to function. Yet these reports address overall market fundamentals and
functions so traders and market professionals can understand the big picture
as it relates to their overall trade plan. Institutional reports are always forward
looking and written by market professionals with the ability to understand and
analyze big-picture issues. Much information can be derived from professional
reports in terms of strategies, risks, and highlighting of possible scenarios with
future implications to profi t. The key is to understand the various reports and
their implications because some reports are nation specifi c while others address
the overall market as it relates from nation to nation.
This section addresses a variety of market-intelligence reports that relate
both to a specifi c nation and overall market picture. This section incorporates
not only reports from a market-intelligence perspective but institutional his-
tories, frequencies of reports, and types of information released and addressed.
Bank of International Settlements
Before we discuss the much-publicized implications of the Bank of Inter-
national Settlements’ Triennial Survey and the not-so-publicized quarterly
report, here’s a quick and basic overview of the role, functions, and historical

aspects of the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) due to its profound
importance to not only world banking and economic stability, but the mar-
kets in particular, both yesterday and today.
Established in 1930 as the world’s banker, the BIS today is much more than
the facilitator of gold and FX transactions for the 54 central banks that con-
tributed to its 2007 report. It was originally established to repatriate German
monies to the Allies after the war at the behest of the Bank of England, which
called for its establishment. How to implement further Treaty of Versailles’
arrangements between nations after World War I further heightened its need
as intermediator to facilitate multilateral payments and currency conversions.
Its location in Basel, Switzerland, attests to not only its neutrality but its com-
mitment to carry out its mandate (BIS 2010).
The real existential challenge to the BIS came during the 1930s at the
height of the currency wars, when the Bank of England suspended its gold
standard in 1931 and the United States did the same in 1933. Gold-backed
nations sought stability due to currency price fl uctuations by the United
States and the United Kingdom as trade imbalances seriously deviated from
the norm of gold-backed nations and threatened their economic existence
(BIS 2010).
The resolution was the Tripartite Agreement signed by the United
States, France, and England in 1936 to ensure price stability and to abstain
from competitive economic devaluations of currency prices as long as cur-
rency prices didn’t destabilize the economic balance of trade. While the world
prevented a crisis, the BIS maintained its existence until the bank was rescued
by President Truman in 1948 when the United Nations voted for its dis-
solution in 1944. Ironically, Franklin Roosevelt died shortly after in April
1945, so Truman assumed the presidency and, with the help of the United
Kingdom, ensured the bank would remain today as one of the oldest world
institutions (BIS 2010).
Moreover, the BIS provides short-term collateral loans to nations through
their respective central banks and settles trades every trading day at 5:00 p.m.
eastern standard time through its Committee on Payment and Settlements
(BIS 2010). Closing spot currency, outright forwards, currency options, and
swap prices are established at the 5:00 p.m. settlement to end a full-cycle trad-
ing day. Trading institutions must then refl ect these changes to all accounts
the world over through their respective central banks.
The Committee on Payment and Settlements ensures that world markets
not only function properly but further ensures this functionality replicates
itself every trading day. Rollover debits and credits are marked to market
at the 5:00 p.m. close. Market bid/ask spreads tend to change dramatically at

times as traders begin the new trading day during the Asian session. This
however depends on the liquidity provided to markets based on trading
activity. Robust trading means decreased spreads as liquidity is provided to
the markets.
Triennial Survey
Since 1989 and every three years thereafter, the BIS publishes its quite detailed
Triennial Survey through its Markets Committee and the Committee on the
Global Financial System—established in 1971—that focuses on daily turn-
over in U.S. dollar amounts and outstanding contracts in FX for the last
three years.
Information is reported to the BIS by central banks—54 at the 2007
count up from 52 in 2004, 48 in 2001, 43 in 1998, and 26 in 1995 (BIS
2007 Triennial Survey ). Surveys covered data on amounts outstanding of
over-the-counter (OTC) FX interest rate, equity and commodity, and credit
derivatives. FX, spot, outright forwards, foreign exchange swaps, and cur-
rency and interest-rate derivatives are surveyed. Interestingly, the 2007 report
included for the fi rst time credit default swaps (CDS).
These surveys feature quite detailed reports that serve as important guides
for market professionals and traders because they determine where money
fl owed to seek its best yield and the types of instruments utilized to facilitate
those returns. All have important implications for the spot trade.
Triennial Survey 2007 versus 2004
From the 2007 report provided in Exhibit 1.1, Global Foreign Exchange
Market Turnover, we learned that daily turnover of all spot, outright forwards
and swap transactions increased to $3.2 trillion, up from $1.9 trillion in
2004, a 69 percent increase. Based on types of instruments from Exhibit 1.1,
swaps rose 80 percent in 2007, an increase of 45 percent from 2004. But
notice the number of up-to-seven-day swap transactions in Exhibit 1.1 that
increased since its full reporting period began in 1995.
From 1995 to 2001, the number of up-to-seven-day swap transactions
doubled to the over–seven-day counterpart, while those same transactions dou-
bled from 2004 to 2007 with the number of swap transactions on a continual
rise. Why? A swap is primarily an agreement to exchange cash fl ows. One can
look at swaps as a bank simultaneously buying or selling a currency for one
maturity and selling or buying the equivalent amount at a later date. They trade

OTC and were once employed primarily when normal markets couldn’t offer
fi nancing, but their popularity has increased year over year as a regular form
of fi nance. A swap can be an interest rate swap, a commodity swap, an equity
swap, or a currency swap.
Yet swaps can be employed as a hedge against an interest rate swap, a cur-
rency swap, a commodity swap, or an equity swap. As noted in Exhibit 1.2,
a trend developed from 2006 to 2010. As interest rate spreads tightened,
implied volatilities decreased and carry to risk rose.
As noted in Exhibit 1.3, clearly the U.S. dollar and other currencies are
the most widely traded swaps from 2001 to 2007, followed by the euro,
Japanese yen, pound sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar, and Australian
dollar.
The number of outright forwards from its up-to-seven-day to its over–
seven-day trade has held steady since the full reporting began in 1995. Yet

swap transactions far outnumber outright forwards by four times in 2007 and
fi ve times in 2004. Overall outright forwards increased 73 percent in 2007
from 2004. An outright forward is a transaction where two parties agree to
buy or sell a predetermined amount of currency at an agreed rate sometime
in the agreed-upon future. Traders trade views based on future exchange rates.
Major world companies doing business across borders trade forwards to
take advantage of a particular exchange rate to repatriate money, to lock in
rates for future business, to hedge, and speculate.
Spot transactions increased 56 percent in 2007 from 2004, according to
latest reports, but this increase was lower than previous years. Yet from 1998
to 2007, spot transactions almost doubled from $568 billion to $1.5 trillion
and almost tripled from $394 billion in 1992 to $1.05 trillion in 2007. Notice
how swaps slightly outnumber spot transactions from 1995 to 2007. Further
notice how swap transactions almost doubled over spot transactions in 2001.
Spot traded $387 billion to $656 billion for swaps. Interest rate volatility may
be one explanation because interest rate swaps are the most widely traded of
all swap instruments. Yet 2001 was the year 9/11 occurred, so much volatility
was experienced (Triennial Survey 2004, 2007).
In Exhibit 1.4, the U.S. dollar is by far the most widely traded element
of a pair. The number one traded pair is the euro, yen, sterling, Australia,
Swiss franc, and Canadian dollar. And all traded against or with the U.S.
dollar. An interesting phenomenon is the Hong Kong dollar that traded a
daily turnover of $79 billion in 1998 to $175 billion in 2007. The Singapore
dollar falls within the same parameters of daily turnover exhibits. Both trade
in government controlled trading bands.

The interbank market in 2007 accounted for 43 percent of all foreign
exchange transactions, down from 53 percent in 2004. The retail currency
broker may be one explanation, as well as the number of swap and forward
transactions that occur on the OTC market.
While the Triennial report may have a three-year look-back period, it
has profound effects for currency markets. We learned that spot and swap

transactions account for the majority of foreign-currency trades around the
world, about $2.7 trillion in 2007. The U.S. dollar by far is the most widely
traded instrument, followed by the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Swiss
franc, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. All other currencies of the
world are thinly traded and can’t compare to the amounts traded of these
major currencies. One reason is the convertibility factor.
Of the vast majority of the world’s currencies, 150 of 200 can’t be
directly converted, so conversion is facilitated through the major currencies
because they are more liquid. Another reason is larger economies where
trade and investment not only fl ow freely but gross domestic product
(GDP) levels are high. Add a robust economy and stable political system to
the equation, and traders have a recipe for success when the focus is trade
in these major pairs.
With rising GDP levels in the major economies and an increasing supply
of money earned, imagine what the supply of dollars will be in the future and
future dollar amounts of trade. Trade the major currencies because currency
prices are allowed to free fl oat where the market sets the price.
BIS Annual Report
While the Triennial Survey may have a three-year look-back period, the
BIS publishes a very detailed annual report. The 79th annual study was
released in March 2009 (BIS Markets Committee 2009). These reports are
consequential, an imperative for market professionals because of the detailed
orientation with which the BIS approaches topics from a world perspective.
Because the prior period focused on implications for world economies, exam-
ining markets and banking systems from a global perspective due to the
collapse are just a few aspects of the report.
Since the collapse, there are many implications for spillover effects around
the world. This was viewed in terms of interest rates and imbalances across
the world. Spillover effects can be viewed in terms of contagion. Contagion
asks the question, Does a crisis in one nation have ramifi cations for other
neighboring nations, or worse, does a crisis have implications for all world
economies? What that meant for investment bankers, banks, and insurance
companies is profound in terms of investments, cash fl ows, and profi ts and is
highlighted extensively in this report.
Such questions had to be answered to align proper funding and ensure
profi t margins. Questions such as: Where does money fl ow to seek its yield,
and how can investors take advantage of those situations? Bank capital was

the greatest question, because as credit spreads widened an increase in the
price of capital available to lend became an issue. Where do hedge funds
and insurance companies fi t into this equation? What are risk opportunities?
Where should monies not be invested is the question. What about possible
policy responses to the collapse? A detrimental policy response can cost a
nation and their markets irreparable harm for years. Those decisions must be
viewed with a discerning eye.
The annual report is 250 pages, complete with charts, graphs, and many
statistical measures that outlined pre crisis to the crisis and beyond. It has
a one-year look-back period, but its reports can be profound in terms of
exchange rates and spot trades.
BIS Quarterly Review
As noted in Exhibit 1.5, more important on a shorter-term basis is the
Quarterly Review published by the BIS, where a glimpse of the last three
months of trading activity and highlights can be viewed.
Equity prices recovered, credit spreads fell as the cost of borrowing
decreased, and bond prices rose with equity markets. Two major market
occurrences materialized during this period that sent the markets reeling:
The Lehman Brothers collapse and the announcement of the Volcker Rule in
January 2009. The Volcker Rule was the proposal by former Federal Reserve
Chairman Paul Volcker and current economic assistant to President Obama,

who proposed that banks limit proprietary and speculative trading if the trade
wasn’t implemented based on client desires.
As seen in Exhibit 1.6, January 10, 2009, saw equity prices, especially
bank stocks, in Europe and in the U.S. dive, credit spreads widen, yields fall,
and the safety of government bond prices soar upwards.
Finally, see Exhibit 1.6, and notice as equity prices rose in 2009, agricul-
tural, crude oil, and metals prices fell. This equation is not only a common
denominator of market developments since the crisis hit in August 2008, but
a common occurrence of historical intermarket movements.
FX Committee in the United States
In addition to the BIS FX reports, each central bank of the major nations has
its own FX committee that imitates for the most part the work of the BIS.
For example, the FX Committee was formed in 1978 under the sponsorship
of the Federal Reserve. An annual report published every year since 1979 high-
lights past yearly market activity in foreign exchange. Earlier reports focused on
advisory roles of the FX Committee and processes of market activity because
free-fl oating exchange rates recently began, so questions of structure and pro-
cess had to be defi ned by both the markets and the committee.
As spot-market structure began and settled into a system, new invest-
ment vehicles such as forward interest-rate agreements, interest-rate swaps,
and currency options had to be addressed. For example, what happens to an
options delta 25 hedge when the market expects volatility? According to the
recently introduced 1973 Black-Scholes Model of option pricing, the hedge

                     PAGE 27                      
==================================================

12 Inside the Currency Market
could be at risk due to market volatility. Delta hedging was addressed in the
1984 annual FX Committee’s Report as a study of risk assessment with the
recent introduction of currency options.
Legal issues are addressed by the FX Committee such as the recent intro-
duction in the United States, and trading arrangements of, the Chilean peso,
the Columbian peso, the Peruvian sol, the Brazilian real, and the Chinese
renminbi. Not only spot rates are introduced, but currency options, for-
wards, swaps, and other legally agreed terms are set. This is all handled by
FX committees.
The Committee’s fi rst volume survey was published in 1980 as a trial,
and was published every three years thereafter until 2005 when the commit-
tee proposed a semi-annual survey. The 1982 committee discussed adoption
of volume surveys as a regular practice due to the increased volume of the
market. For example, the Japanese yen traded $8 billion a month in 1976 and
increased to $75 billion a month by 1981. Such issues had to be addressed.
The 1980 survey highlighted a 64 percent market share for spot transac-
tions and 51 percent in 1983. Swaps traded 30 percent of market share in
1980 and 48 percent in 1983. Forwards accounted for 6 percent of market
share in 1980 and 0.5 percent in 1983. The low volume in 1983 was caused
by a ruling by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in Rule 52
that stated forwards should be treated as stockholder equity rather than cur-
rent earnings (1980 report).
The German mark was the most widely traded currency in 1983 with
32 percent of all spot, forwards, and swap transactions, and 31 percent in
1980. The yen was second in 1983 with a 22 percent market share, up from
fourth in 1980 with a 10.2 percent turnover. The pound sterling was second
in 1980 with a 22.2 percent share and third in 1983 with a 16.6 percent
share. The Swiss franc was fourth in 1983 with a 12.2 percent share and fi fth
in 1980 with a 10.1 percent market share. The Canadian dollar was fi fth in
1983 with a 7.5 percent share, down from third place in 1980 with a 12.3
percent share. Cross currencies accounted for $1.5 billion in April 1983 (FX
Committee 1995).
Since 2005, the FX Committee has published its semi-annual volume
survey that highlights forwards, swaps, option, and spot transactions. Volume
surveys focus on monthly volumes, dollar changes year over year, and vol-
umes by currency pair, by counter-party, and by maturity.
Notice Exhibit 1.7 of the pie chart from the most recent survey. Spot
transactions accounted for $388 billion, 57 percent of all FX transactions,
while swaps garnered 26 percent of the market with a volume of $176
billion. Forwards accounted for 13 percent of the market with a volume of

Worldwide FX Committees
Major trading nations of the world established their own counterparts to the
FX Committee through their respective central banks. The United Kingdom,
through the Bank of England, established the U.K. Foreign Exchange Joint
Standing Committee, Singapore adopted the Foreign Exchange Market
Committee, Canada through the Bank of Canada established the Foreign
Exchange Committee, Australia through its Royal Bank of Australia adopted
the Foreign Exchange Committee, Europe through the European Central
Bank established the Foreign Exchange Contact Group, Japan established
its FX Market Committee through the Bank of Japan, Hong Kong estab-
lished its FX Committee through its Hong Kong Monetary Authority called
the Treasury Markets Association, and Switzerland established the Federal
Supervisory Markets Committee from the Swiss National Bank.
The purpose of reports such as those issued by the BIS and the various
FX committees is not to wholly focus on volume and types of trades, but that
in itself is an important function. More important are the types of instru-
ments traded, where money fl ows to seek yield, who the major players in the
world are, and where the economic growth is in terms of a specifi c nation
or region.

14 Inside the Currency Market
The major questions answered by these reports are where should resources
be allocated, how should portfolios be adjusted, and what are the risks? Is a
certain nation’s currency overbought or oversold, is a certain region over-
bought or oversold, and will past strategies work in the future? For example,
of the seven major widely traded currencies, three are considered commodity
currencies, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. If all three had long runs
based on prior reports and their respective natural resources sold well, will
those same strategies work in the future?
Conclusion
Traders and market professionals must understand the constant attention
paid to overall industry changes in these reports by consummate market pro-
fessionals who look at forward changes and market developments through
reports, statistics, and market studies. Volumes are just one side of the overall
equation. Yet we know from past volume histories that the spot transaction
is the dominant instrument traded yesterday, and chances are good that spot
will dominate foreign currency transactions long into the future.
Professional market reports provide an insight, an intelligence of a mar-
ket that may undergo changes in design, structure, or some feature that may
enhance or limit a market’s overall ability. Yet reports can answer questions
as to present strategies and possible tactical changes. Reports serve as market
guides, a road map that can hint at direction of a currency pair, highlight
an overbought region, gain insight into a new trading instrument, and even
provide insight into a government position on tax and fi scal policies. Many
reports exist nation to nation and all are released at various times throughout
any given year. Because of the forward nature of various reports, much can be
gained due to the depth and detail professionals devote to every issue.

CHAPTER 2
Currency Trading
Beyond the Basics
This chapter will address the many foundations and theories of money and
exchange rates as well as the histories behind those theories. The chapter begins
with concepts of the currency market, participants, and foundations that com-
prise currency pairs. The belief is that understanding currency pairs must equate
to an understanding of how other nations view their own currencies and how
those currencies are traded in their respective markets. Concepts such as mar-
gin, rollover interest, and how that interest is debited and credited to accounts is
important to denote amounts of revenue that may be earned or lost. All is high-
lighted from a nation-to-nation perspective. Histories of economic formations are
addressed as they relate to an economic structure, and concepts such as interest
rates that hold economies together are detailed. Purchasing Power Parity is a turn-
of-the-century concept that still has relevance today, so it was addressed in detail.
All concepts have relevance to not only understand the currency markets but to
understand the markets in relation to gaining profi ts.
One common theme that should be stated, promoted, and understood
throughout this text is that currency trading is about money, the cost of
money, the demand and supply of it, and the price in relation to the various
currency pairs and assets it mimics. How much does money cost and can
demand meet supply or supply meet demand are just a few questions that
will be answered. These answers can only be determined in the interbank
market through interest rates and fi nancial instruments associated with inter-
est. Interest-rate formulas have as their foundation:
Simple Interest (cid:3) Principal (cid:4) Rate (cid:4) Time
From nation to nation, central bank to central bank, the answers are
different because cost factors and funding needs are distinct. A commodity

16 Inside the Currency Market
currency has different cost and funding needs as opposed to a manufacturing
currency nation and economic situations allow various pairs to move dif-
ferently from each other. Larger nations are different than smaller nations.
Export nations are distinct from import nations. Cross pairs and U.S. dollar
pairs are quite different in movement and cost structure. Each economy varies
in size, shape, cost, and fi nance needs. Yet these factors are aligned as currency
pairs. Historic currency pair terminology referred to pairs as commodity/
terms and terms/commodity. To bring these factors into balance and under-
standing, I explore the numerous factors involved to answer these questions,
because not all currency pairs are the same. All have a distinctness, a purpose,
a reason for existence, and a reason for movement. And many have a market
interest in these factors.
Banks, governments, central banks, major companies throughout the
world, importers and exporters, traders, speculators, hedge funds, pension
funds, cross-currency investors, traders and speculators, carry traders, organi-
zations, and tourists, to name a few, are all involved in this market on a daily
basis. A trading indicator won’t necessarily help to understand this answer
because it looks at these factors in the short term and from the inside out
without a look at the whole picture of a nation and its particular pair.
The important answer to understand is what makes a currency turn to
strength or a sell and what are factors that force market weakness—a long.
A currency price is based on the cost factor, the price of money, and the price
that others are willing to buy or sell for in terms of an interest rate. Any market
implications that hamper a currency pair’s funding or cost structure means that
that pair will be sold to refl ect the new cost and funding structure. Inversely, a
pair will be bought if funding and cost aren’t hindered. From a single-nation
perspective, internal funding is conducted through sales of bonds, notes, and
bills and it connects to external factors of foreign exchange such as Spots,
swaps, and forwards. Failure to connect can hamper the overall structure.
For example, a spot trader in Great Britain would want the British
pound/U.S. dollar pair to trend toward weakness, to trend upward. This
means England’s economy must have strong economic output, rising wages,
rising consumer prices, rising producer prices, rising exports, and rising inter-
est rates. In this instance, the cost and funding structure is cheap and the
Bank of England can easily meet these funding needs while its nation’s manu-
facturers and consumers enjoy good economic times. Any problems along
this journey and the British pound/U.S. dollar pair will be sold as the cost of
money rises and funding needs can’t be met.
Most important is the idea that a currency pair is a two-sided equation
that must be understood from a two-nation perspective in terms of price,

cost, funding structures, and reasons when, how, and why pairs move. To
understand is to profi t.
Pips and Lots
Spot-currency trading is conducted through pips. A pip is a percentage inter-
est point. A 100 pip move up or down in any currency pair equates to one
penny, a common occurrence on any given trading day. The market term for
a 100 pip move is a Big Figure, slang is big fi g. Just like a Milliard is equal to
one billion units of currency, the market term is Yard to equal a billion units.
The value of a pip depends on the type of lot traded. A standard lot equates
to control of 100,000 currencies; it is one one-hundredth of a point, one basis
point, or $10 per pip. For most pairs, this is found in the fourth decimal place,
second decimal place for the Japanese yen. For example, British pound/U.S.
dollar is the British pound sterling versus the United States dollar. So British
pound/U.S. dollar is equal to 0.0001 multiplied by 100,000 and equals
$10.00. A mini lot is British pound/U.S. dollar is equal to 0.0001 (cid:4) 10,000
and equals $1.00. A standard lot is $10.00 per pip, two lots are $20.00 per
pip, three lots are $30.00 per pip. No dollar limits exist on the amount of lots
to buy or sell. A mini lot is 10,000 trades at $1.00 per pip, two lots is $2.00
per pip, three lots is $3.00 per pip. There are no limits to dollar amounts or
number of lots to buy or sell. The advantage of a mini lot is that one can buy
or sell 15 mini lots or one standard lot and a half. One standard lot is equal to
10 mini lots. It is perfect for a small trader with limited funds.
Micro Lots are equal to 0.10. Each lot trades at 1 cent a pip. Quotes
here are in U.S. dollars because the base currency is in U.S. dollars. Suppose
we have U.S. dollar/Swiss franc. How much does each pip earn? Divide
by the exchange rate. For example, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc exchange rate is
1.0570, equal to $10.00 divided by 1.0570, so it is $9.46 per pip based on
one standard lot. How much does a lot cost? The price of a lot is differ-
ent from market to market and it depends on which market to trade, how
much liquidity is available, how much bids and offers cost, and the amount
of narrowing or widening of the spreads.
Bid/Ask—The Difference Is in the Spread!
All traders once paid a per-lot price, but recent changes now stipulate traders
pay a spread between the bid and ask. Currencies are now quoted in bid/ask

18 Inside the Currency Market
thanks to retail brokers that sell currencies back to the interbank market. Bid/
ask can also be viewed in the context of bid/offer, buy/sell, borrow/lend, and
even deposit/lend where deposit rates create a fl oor and lend rates create a
ceiling. The difference is the spread.
The bid appears on the left side of a currency pair and that is the quote
to sell while the ask is the price to buy and appears on the right. The ask
always exceeds the bid. Ask minus bid equals the cost of a trade per one lot.
The price of a spread depends on liquidity of the market and the particular
currency pair. Fast markets and high volatility will see small spreads generally.
Illiquid currency pairs or illiquid markets will see higher spreads.
Some pairs such as the British pound/Japanese yen or U.S. dollar/South
African Rand may see higher spreads due to wide-ranging movements. The
U.S. dollar/South African Rand can cost as much as 200 to 300 pips for
the spread and as little as 70 pips depending on volatility. Trading the majors
against the U.S. dollar and even the cross pairs should cost between 2 and
10 pips, as a general range in the United States and Canada, double easily in
Switzerland and the vast majority in Europe and Hong Kong. Japanese bro-
ker pip spreads are as competitive as the United States.
To determine percentage terms Ask Rate – Bid divided by the Ask rate.
Directional determinations of spot prices based on smaller bid/ask spreads
are not as easily determined today. With recent changes from a per-lot
price to a spread, it is hard to answer because it is not an area of great inter-
est to researchers presently. Recent studies focused on volatility in relation to
spreads, so general assumptions can only be rendered presently. One aspect
widely employed in the past to determine direction was to calculate bid/ask
spreads in terms of arithmetic means, but because the spreads are so minus-
cule the best answer would be to employ percents. The analytical eye would
also determine direction as a bid or ask price would be supported on any price
divergences. Sometimes an indicator may hint at direction but the overall
market may have other purposes and it shows within the bid/ask spread.
Punishing the United States with Margins
Most margins in the United States allows for a 100 to 1 leverage and a 1 p ercent
margin. One standard lot to control 100,000 currencies requires traders to
maintain the 1 percent margin. To fall below will mean a trader must add
money to the account or the broker will sell out the position by a margin
call and a trader will suffer the loss. A current proposal by the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to limit margins is underway as this is

written. And this has happened yet again as the war against currency markets
continues. Leverage is now 50:1 with a 2 percent margin, 20:1 leverage with
a 5 percent margin for exotic pairs such as U.S. dollar/South African Rand
and U.S. dollar/Turkish Lira. Taking this into account, the United States is
the most punished nation in the world.
Mrs. Wantanabe and the Margin Japan
About 120 currency brokers exist in Japan, down from 500 in 2005 and all
offer leverage that can be as high as 400 to 1. Japanese accounts traded $302.5
billion a day according to the 2007 Triennial Report. The Japanese have a
long, long history of active trading and the modern day is no different. Yet
the governing arm of the currency markets, the Financial Services Authority
in Japan is currently proposing to limit margins to 50 to 1 in 2010 and 25 to
1 in 2011. The Bank of Japan released a report in 2008 and found that one
tenth of all spot trades were transacted by margin traders, so the trading pub-
lic is fi rmly against these proposals almost by a 70 to 30 margin according to
recent polls. The most famous person in Japan is Mrs. Wantanabe, a fi ctitious
person representative of a vast group of everyday traders who comprise a vast
majority of the Japanese public. The idea is as Mr. Wantanabe works during
the day, Mrs. Wantanabe is helping earn income by trading.
Margin: Europe, Switzerland, England, Australia,
Hong Kong, and Canada
Spreads are higher through European brokers compared to the U.S. but lever-
age is 100 to 1 with a 1 percent margin in some nations. Generally brokers
apply automatically a 5 percent margin that can be changed higher at the
request of the trader. This equates to a 50-to-1 margin. The British pound/
Japanese yen will cost easily a set nine-pip spread and higher throughout any
trading day, 70 pips for U.S. dollar/South African Rand.
Switzerland is no different in set spread prices, yet some Swiss brokers
also charge a volume commission. Traders pay the least amount of these three
categories: volume according to net deposit, volume based on equity, or vol-
ume based on traded volume. The price paid is based in U.S. dollars, not
Swiss francs. The higher the equity and the more volume of trades, the less
a trader pays. Another way to view this is in terms of volume versus price
quotes.

If a foreign currency is the quote (bottom) and the local currency is the
terms (top), this is called a price quote. The foreign currency is priced in
terms of the local currency. If a foreign currency is the terms (bottom) and
the local currency is the quote (top), this is called a volume quote. Other
fi rms offer spreads without a commission but the spreads are higher than the
United States. The competitiveness may be derived because the Swiss tout
their low capital-gain rates.
England is by far the best throughout the world in all categories, includ-
ing pip spreads, taxes, hedging, rollovers, and margin. London is the home of
currency trading and it lives up to its reputation. Australia encourages traders
as well and offers a decent system for traders.
Canada offers a 25-to-1 leverage with a 4 percent margin. Pip spreads are
slightly higher than the United States, but still competitive.
Hong Kong sets margin at 20 to 1, 5 percent of open positions, 3 percent
to maintain, and below 1 percent means the position will be liquidated for
a loss. These rules are set by the Securities and Futures Commission. Some
nations help and encourage traders and markets, others punish.
Rollovers
In the United States, rollover interest is debited or credited to accounts at
5:00 p.m. eastern time for positions held overnight. This process began in
1994 to settle spot prices so a standard system of exchange rates could be
established to settle old contracts and enter into new agreements. The prior
time was 4:00 p.m. in conjunction with the New York Stock Exchange close,
but changed to 5:00 p.m. in later years.
At 5:01, the opportunity to gain interest is lost until the next trading day
at 5:01 p.m. Rollover interest works based on interest rates, short and long
term. Suppose a trader is long Australian dollar/U.S. dollar, meaning a trader
bought the Australian dollar and sold the U.S. dollar pair. The interest rate in
Australia is currently 4.25, and the interest rate is 0.25 in the United States.
Based on the formula to calculate interest, a positive account will receive
the difference of 4.25 minus 0.25, so 4 percent. Four percent multiplied by
100,000 for one standard lot equals $4,000. $4,000 divided by 365 days is
equal to $10.95. This interest amount is credited to the account, per lot, on
a daily basis as long as the position remains open.
Suppose a trader sold British pound/Australian dollar. Here a trader
sells the Australian dollar and buys the British pound. England’s interest
rate is 0.50 and Australia’s is 4.25. This account will always receive a

negative rollover due to negative interest. Monies will be debited daily on a
per lot basis.
There is one caveat to this interest-rate trading strategy. During the course
of any trading day, short-term interest rates ebb and fl ow based on market
events such as news announcements, volatility, and liquidity. The quoted roll-
over on the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar position is based on a per-annum
basis. It is the benchmark interest rate between two nations and used by many
brokers as accepted and legal practice. But rates will ebb and fl ow throughout
the day. If for some market reason U.S. dollar rates traded higher, Australian
dollars would receive less interest for the day. It is the factor, how each broker
debits and credits rollover.
Rollover Rates and LIBOR
Rates are factored based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR),
which is released by the British Bankers Association every day at about
11:30 a.m. London time, about 5:00 a.m. eastern time. It is the reference
rate for the following currencies: Swiss franc, British pound, U.S. dollar,
Canadian dollar, Australian and New Zealand dollars, Japanese yen, euro,
Danish krone, and Swedish krona. The majority of the world’s trading
nations follow these rates, but this is just the start of rates as the New York
markets begin. Where these unsecured borrowed LIBOR will go based on
the course of any trading day can at times be unpredictable. This is due to
the factors of the LIBOR.
LIBOR is the offered rate, a rate at which banks will lend unsecured
funds. LIBID is the bid rate, the rate at which banks wish to borrow unse-
cured funds, and LIMEAN is the average rate of LIBOR and LIBID. What
usually transpires is a rate based on an arithmetic mean or a rate agreed, plus
or minus the spread. Normally the highest and lowest bids and offers are
discarded and the middle rates are averaged to derive the day’s LIBOR. The
question for rollover and trading purposes is how much does money cost on
that day and from nation to nation, because all nations have different cost
structures and liquidity needs.
The most notable effect for residents of these nations is LIBOR are con-
nected to residential housing fi nance, especially in Singapore. With every new
day, rates change as fi nance needs change with a top LIBOR and a lower
LIBID rate, a ceiling and fl oor. See Exhibit 2.1, overnight LIBOR.
The U.S. dollar rates traded higher one day and lower the next. Notice
further how Australian dollar rates edged up in the yesterday column

as the U.S. dollar rates traded down. Further notice overnight LIBOR in
Exhibit 2.1 and notice how far the U.S. dollar rates dropped against their
Australian dollar counterpart.
Australian dollar LIBOR continues to trade at a premium to its bench-
mark rate and may be a sign of either the market anticipating a further rate
hike because borrowing costs are higher or the rate is overbought. Liquidity
and funding needs will determine the answer. For rollover purposes, this rep-
resents continued positive interest payments. Some brokers, particularly in
Europe and Asia, will use swap points instead of the benchmark interest rate
between central banks to determine rollover.
Swap Points and Rollover
Swap points, or forward points, are the bid/ask prices of forward contracts
traded in the interbank market and must be viewed as an interest rate. But
foreign exhange (FX) swaps, particularly interest rate swaps, also incorpo-
rate swap points in their terminology and trade in the interbank market.
The formal defi nition of swap points is the difference between interest
rates on currencies. All currency pairs have different swap rates due to the
differences in interest rates between pairs. Swap points are also termed for-
ward points, FX points, or spot points. Positive forward points are added to
the spot rate while negative points are deducted. Forward points equate
to basis points by multiplying by 100 or 1000. If a swap point appears as
0.0084 and is positive, basis-point terms are already derived. The multi-
plication determines how much. The Czechoslovakian central bank factors
forward points by dividing forward points by 1000 and adding the result



==================================================
                     PAGE 38                      
==================================================

to the spot rate. Future spot prices and future interest is factored based on
forward implied rates.
The formula:
(1 (cid:5) r)#days/12 (cid:3) [(1 (cid:5) Spot)month/12] (cid:4) [(1(cid:5) y)p/12]
where
p (cid:3) number of periods in the implied period.
A last method to look at forward points is by forward margin.
Forward margin is derived from forward rates and expressed as the
future value of a currency pair in terms of the terms and quote. Forward
margin equals the forward rate minus the spot rate and is expressed as
swap or forward points. The reason to employ forward points in rollover
accounts is to debit or credit actual market rates rather than benchmark
interest rates.
For example, Europe debits and credits rollover accounts based on swap
points. Swap points are derived from euro LIBOR, a LIBOR rate released
by the British Bankers Association (BBA) at 6:00 a.m. exclusively for the
European markets. euro LIBOR is used because it is the basis of swap con-
tracts, the basis of interest rates, and the basis of unsecured borrowing for the
trading day in the European interbank market traded in London and overseas.
It is the interest rate more closely aligned to the overall market.
Beside euro LIBOR, the British Bankers Association releases LIBOR for
10 different currency markets with 15 various maturities ranging from over-
night to one year.
Yet each nation releases its own LIBOR to accommodate interest rates
for their own interbank market. For example, Japan releases it’s TIBOR
at 11:00 a.m. Tokyo time, 11:00 p.m. eastern standard time. This rate is
released one hour after the Japanese stock market opens. It is a common con-
vention for nations to release rates just after market openings. So the swap
point basis will change from nation to nation due to the rise and fall daily of
LIBOR within the various nations. Swap-point basis can be derived directly
from bid/ask spreads in the interbank market, LIBOR, or LIBID. What is
credited or debited to a rollover account can range from broker to broker
around the world. Some brokers list their swap points. Others factor the swap
rates and list to view on their trading screens.
Currency Fixing
When LIBOR is released by the BBA and when nations, through their top
bankers, release their own rates, this is called fi xing. Fixing times occur many



==================================================
                     PAGE 39

times throughout any trading day and represent at times trading opportu-
nities. BBA fi xings represent one time and one fi x, the external unsecured
borrowing rate for a nation’s bank doing business in London, while each
nation must set its own fi x to represent its internal unsecured borrowing rate.
All times for the internal fi x of nations are different due to the various time
frames in which nations trade. Because these rates are the shortest and most
sensitive of all interest rates, trading opportunities may occur based on new
bids and offers.
For example, the fact that Tokyo releases its fi xing rates one hour after the
Japanese stock market opens is constructive for short-term gains. Markets will
refl ect LIBOR immediately. Central banks that experience an interest-rate
change are another trading opportunity, because all interest rates short and
long must be refl ected in the market through fi nancial instruments because
the cost to borrow, lend and liquidity needs changed. What is important is
that LIBOR must be priced to the currency. See Exhibit 2.2.
BBA LIBOR and internal nations’ LIBORs must be viewed as an off-
shore and onshore interest rate. The offshore rate allows business and trading
to be conducted overseas in a nation’s currency at a particular BBA rate while
the onshore rate is the rate priced to the currency in the home market. To
factor an interest rate for the home market, take BBA LIBOR and divide it
by the internal rate to obtain an effective interest rate. That rate will be the
basis to trade a currency pair in the home market while the market is open.
If a nation has two internal interest rates, as is the scenario among the major
pairs, divide the two internal rates to obtain an effective rate.
Factor Swap Points
In our Australian dollar/U.S. dollar example, factor closing price by the dif-
ference of interest between pairs divided by 360 multiplied by the number
of lots.
1.9336 (cid:4) 0.04/360 days (cid:4) 100,000 (cid:3) $2.1484
Brokers may charge a fee, 10 percent for some, to handle this and any
rollover transaction. Why? Because brokers must employ a Tom/Next trade.
Tom/Next is the short-term terminology to mean Tomorrow Next. Tom/
Next rates are found in the interbank market and don’t widely vary from day
to day. Spot/next or spot/starts are further terms. In order for the account
to be debited or credited, the trade must be closed then reopened for the

next day’s trade. If Tom/Next is not employed, a trader would have to take
delivery of the currencies in the account.
Day-Count Convention
The original example factored interest payments based on 365 days a
year. After the BBA administers LIBOR, the International Swap and
Derivatives Association (ISDA) sets the benchmark—since 1998—for fi xed
rates on interest-rate swaps and other instruments through its ISDAFIX.
They set rates for the euro, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen, Swiss franc,
British pound, and the U.S. dollar. For the U.S. dollar, they also p rovide
swap spreads. Day-count convention asks how to factor accrued interest
for traded instruments. The United States, Switzerland, and the euro
zone a dminister an actual/360 basis, Great Britain and commonwealth
nations administer an actual/365 basis. To factor leap years, actual/actual
is used. Other instruments such as bonds are factored on a 30/360 basis.
The formula is BBA LIBOR is equal to Interest equal to the principal sum
multiplied by the BBA LIBOR divided by 100 multiplied by the number
of days in the interest period divided by 360.
Accrued interest asks the question how are bond coupons factored? Japan,
Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada factor coupon payments
based on 365 days while the United States, Switzerland, and Europe employ
360 days. Financial instruments may trade based on different day-count
conventions.
For example, Japan factors TIBOR based on 365 days while Euroyen fac-
tors based on 360 days. It is the difference between an offshore and onshore
rate. Eurodollars trade based on a 360-day convention. Effective interest
must be factored.
Financial instruments quoted 360 converts to effective interest by 360
divided by 365 and 365 converts by multiplying 360 by 365.
Triple Rollover
Wednesdays are triple rollover days when accounts are debited or credited
with triple interest to account for the weekend and holidays. Rates are pub-
lished on any trading station as they are released and when closing prices are
issued for the trading day so any trader can determine early and exactly how
much rollover rates pay for the day. Our rollover strategy is called the carry

trade and is popular to earn rollover on a daily or longer-term basis. Yet this
is only one aspect to the carry trade that will be addressed in later chapters.
Trade Strategy
Fix fl ows are released by banks and research companies so market professionals
can gauge direction of interest rates. View the three-month LIBOR. Look for
crosses to determine where one nation’s rates trade above or below another.
For example, suppose U.S. dollar LIBOR traded above Japanese yen. This is a
sell U.S. dollar/Japanese yen trend trade because U.S. dollar rates are not only
higher, but they may be higher for purposes of expectations of future higher
benchmark interest rates or an economic boom to follow. Suppose three-month
U.S. dollar rates crossed above British pound rates. Buy British pound/U.S.
dollar. If U.S. dollar rates crossed below British pound, sell British pound/
U.S. dollar. View correlations from overnight rates to three month and
determine trends to fi nd good rollover rates plus capital a ppreciation. If rates
held steady for both overnight and three-month LIBOR for a particular pair,
chances are good that the trade is a range trade. So sell the range tops and buy
the range bottoms and always allow LIBOR to be the overall guide.
Swap Points versus Rollovers for World Wide Traders
Not all nations employ LIBOR or benchmark interest to credit rollover
accounts. It is important to understand how brokers factor rollover, what
instruments are employed, and how much is debited or credited.
Market Orders
Market orders are defi ned as an entry order, an exit order, a limit order, an
order to hedge a trade, and a stop order to exit a position at a predeter-
mined time. All historic market orders were changed by the National Futures
Association in 2009 due to Rule 2-43. Markets orders to enter and exit a
position were changed as well as rules to manage lot and lot rotation. Lot
rotation is managed by a system of fi rst in, fi rst out, which says that if 10
lots were bought to go long the British pound/U.S. dollar, the fi rst lot must
be addressed before the second lot, then third lot, up to the tenth lot. If a
profi t is earned on the tenth lot, a trader must rotate through the prior nine
lots before the tenth lot’s profi t is allowed to be taken from the market. Rules

to exit a position are done by a one-cancels-the-other order (OCO). This
means an order above or below the market must be entered in order to exit a
position. All rules apply to only U.S. traders in their own market. What was
once a standard and easily applied system to trade has now radically changed.
This convoluted system applies only to U.S. residents in U.S. markets. All
nations highlighted in this text are not subject to such convoluted rules in
their own nations of trade. The main polemic is that markets may run fast at
times, so profi ts may be realized for fl eeting instances. This system can slow
down profi ts in fast markets. Examples of each type of order are provided.
United States
• National Futures Association (NFA)—Regulates currency and other mar-
kets in the United States in conjunction with the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission. In April 2009 with issuance of Rule 2-43, order
rules were changed, hedging rules were changed, and rules were changed
for lot rotation.
• One cancels the other—Once a lot is bought or sold for any pair, an OCO
order must be entered to exit the trade. If the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar
was bought at 1.9336 and exited at 1.9376, a limit order must be placed
above the market at, say, 1.9386. If a short was entered at 1.9376 and
exited at 1.9336, a stop loss order must be entered at, say, 1.9326 to for-
mally exit the trade.
• First in, fi rst out (FIFO)—If a trader bought 10 lots of any currency pair,
the fi rst lot must be addressed and settled before the second, then third,
and onward.
• Hedging—Traders can’t enter a buy or sell at the same time in the same
pair in the same account. To hedge, traders can hedge with two separate
accounts or hedge in another market. For example, the euro/U.S. dollar
can be hedged in the oil market, the currency option market, or the gold
market to name just a few examples.
National Futures Association and Currencies
The adverse decisions to traders and currency markets in particular may be
based on a number of factors. The NFA, as a regulator, has pondered the
question of what is a currency without asking what are currency pairs. Can
one currency be classifi ed as a security or as a derivative, and how should it be
treated in relation to other traded instruments?



==================================================
                     PAGE 44                      
==================================================

Currency Trading Beyond the Basics 29
NFA regulators haven’t objectively answered these questions, so they treat
a currency as a security—a stock—and place limits on its trading ability just
as a stock would trade. To treat one currency as a derivative is just not objec-
tionable either, due to the lack of an underlying instrument, so that concept
doesn’t exist unless the decisions were rendered based solely on the views of
the U.S. dollar Index, the only single-currency index.
A currency pair’s value is based on the corresponding pair it aligns to
in relation to the nation that it trades. Only the economic situation of a
nation can determine that value through the free markets. In economic terms,
this is called international parity conditions where interest rates, prices, and
exchange rates are linked to form the market-price model. Therefore, a cur-
rency cannot be viewed as a single entity in isolation because it detracts from
the concept of currency pairs as trading vehicles, funding m echanisms, and
a measured value of a nation’s economic conditions and worth. Further, a
currency pair is a money-market instrument and priced against other instru-
ments in the money market. To hinder a currency-pair trade ability can only
hinder other priced instruments in the same money market.
Orders: Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong,
Japan, Switzerland, Canada, and England
Several nations are governed by their own NFA that sets policies and regula-
tions according to the nation’s desires.
Japan has the Financial Services Authority; the United Kingdom has
the Financial Services Authority; Hong Kong has the Securities and Futures
Commission; New Zealand has the Securities Commission of New Zealand;
Switzerland is home to the Swiss Financial Markets Supervisory Authority;
and Canada has the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of
Canada.
The United States is the only nation that placed restrictions on cur-
rency trading. In other nations, hedging is allowed, straight limit orders are
allowed, stop orders are allowed, trailing stops are allowed, and there are no
restrictions to lot rotations and FIFO.
The recently passed 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act section 743 and 744 prevents account openings in the c ountries
listed previously for U.S. citizens. Any accounts held in these l ocations at the
time of passage were closed and funds repatriated. This says that traders any-
where in the world can trade U.S. markets as they desire but U.S. traders can’t
trade their own markets as they desire due to adverse restrictions.

Brokers: Yesterday and Today
Since 1998, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has allowed the
implementation of Electronic Communication Networks under Rule 600 b
23 of Regulation NMS and found in the Securities and Exchange Act of
1934, 11A (SEC 2010).
The National Market System (NMS) was formed to promote fair-market
competition and effi cient markets and is regulated by Congress and enforced
by the CFTC. The focus of NMS in its infancy addressed trade of stocks
when, for example, the 1975 rules facilitated linkages of systems that traded
stocks. All U.S. stock markets connected to one system. Time passed and
NMS was again the focus to ensure fair market access, order protection, inter-
market price competition, fair price protection, and access rules, as was the
case with the 2005 updates (SEC 2006).
As new fi nancial instruments developed, retail brokers, traders, and
hedge funds developed with fast computers. NMS was again the subject of
debate and hearings in Congress. Congress, the SEC, and CFTC are currently
addressing the May 6, 2010 Flash Crash when Greece announced horrendous
economic news and the New York Stock Exchange dropped 1000 points on
the day. What will occur to further enhance effi cient markets or slow the
speed through the NMS system is a guess at this stage. The questions are
speed of computers and fair access.
Originally, networks facilitated trade through a network of buy and sell
orders routed through NASDAQ. All electronic communication networks
(ECNs) had to register with the SEC as a broker dealer and became subject
to regulation as an Alternative Trading System. Early debates included ques-
tions of access to the network and whether fees should be charged for access.
Questions of trading commissions came next, as well as fees for dormant
accounts.
As time progressed and old issues settled, the personal computer and
increased access to the networks allowed retail and professional traders access
to the markets. Today retail traders can trade many types of fi nancial instru-
ments from futures to options to currencies to stocks on any exchange around
the world and even at the same time.
Currency brokers found their purpose as middlemen to support the trade
of currencies from retail traders to the interbank network. In the beginning,
they charged a fi xed price on a per-lot basis. With better and faster comput-
ers, the fi xed-lot price was reduced to a spread price as trading outside the
interbank market exploded.

Currency Trading Beyond the Basics 31
Today the majority of currency brokers earn their revenue from the
spread. Traders must be aware of brokers that make markets in certain curren-
cies. Their role changed from facilitator to dealer. Unsuspecting retail traders
in these instances trade against their own broker. As retail traders buy and
sell lots from these brokers, dealers facilitate separate trades for profi t in the
interbank market and may earn the same revenue twice.
Exchange Rates: The Impact of Keynes
and Mundell-Fleming
When one ponders the question of what is or what should be the price of one
currency in relation to another, the modern day and accepted answer is the
nominal or real exchange rate, the purchasing power parity, or balance of pay-
ment models. How these models were derived should be the question, as well
as their validity. A brief walk through history will help to explain.
Classical theorists focused their attention on monetary policy as it relates
to the level of prices in an economy in terms of the money supply. They
believed that as the money supply increased, price levels would increase along
with the exchange rate without any dramatic effects to an economy in terms
of growth and output. If growth in the money supply increases infl ation,
interest rates and the currency price would refl ect these economic variables
but still not affect an economy’s growth rates. Then John Maynard Keynes
turned this theory upside down.
No discussion of macroeconomics can neglect John Maynard Keynes.
Keynes believed that economies always move toward equilibrium. How equi-
librium fi nds its place in an economy was the source of contested debate for
classical economists and Keynesians in the 1930s. This debate is continuous;
it is argued today on a higher order.
Building on this premise, 1972 Economic Nobel Laureate John Hicks in
1937 introduced the Investment Savings and Liquidity Preference for Money
Supply (IS/LM) Model. It is actually two equilibrium models linked together,
income to interest rates and expenditures to income. Equilibrium is the inter-
section of nominal interest rates to gross domestic product (GDP) or income.
The measure is not only economic equilibrium and interest rates, but the
proper output of goods and services. Aligned properly, one can determine
how an economy fully functions to its perfect capacity.
The IS curve measures interest rates on the vertical axis and income on
the horizontal axis. Income in 1937 was a measure of GDP, beyond 1937 it



==================================================
                     PAGE 47                      
==================================================

32 Inside the Currency Market
measured, for example, exports, savings, and government spending. The IS
curve is a quantity of equilibrium as it relates to total spending to total out-
put. It is measured by the equation:
Y (cid:3) C (cid:5) I
The premise is that interest rates ebb and fl ow with investment along the
curve. Higher interest rates equate to a higher return on investments. But if
investment in terms of profi tability is uncertain due to high interest rates, the
investment is scrapped. For these reasons, the IS curve is downward sloping.
The Liquidity Preference and Money Supply (LM) curve measures
demand for money on the vertical axis and the supply of money held by
banks on the horizontal axis. The measure is the demand for money and
investment. Equilibrium occurs when demand equals the supply on the
money markets. The positive is if money demand is uncertain, consumers
will be cautious. If money is cheap in terms of a low interest rate, consum-
ers will buy assets. With high interest rates, they will sell assets. Two types of
money were identifi ed by Keynes—speculative and uncertain.
Uncertain money is used for basic living, and speculative money is used
for investment. This equation is represented by M/P where M (cid:3) the money
supply and P (cid:3) the fi xed price level or interest rate. So
M/P (cid:3) L(Y) (cid:5) L2 (I)
L2 (I) (cid:3) M/P (cid:2) L1 (Y)
This curve points upwards.
Equilibrium occurs when IS is equal to LM and answers the question
where does supply equal demand in terms of money and interest rates? The
method of determination is to plot points to further specify the balance of
monetary policy. To accommodate for fi scal policy, Income is equal to con-
sumer spending (Income minus Taxes) plus Investment multiplied by the
interest rate as a function of real interest rates plus government spending.
While this equilibrium model was presented in its basic form, inputs can
be mixed and matched, as the case has been since 1937, to determine equilib-
rium of an economy. The glue that held this model together and the method
employed to fully understand an amply functional economy is interest rates.
If this economy would have been fully functional today, a nation’s
economy would have been refl ected in its currency price since interest rates,
above all, are what drive spot prices. Although this model and the classical
model may have an inward bias that determines a look at an economy at one

moment in time, it led to the understanding of the level of bond prices, asset
prices, and construction of yield curves. It was the beginning of understand-
ing exchange rates but it wasn’t enough since only one side of a currency pair
was understood.
Robert Mundell and Marcus Fleming revolutionized the IS/LM Model in
1962 with an introduction of a balance of payments component that would
change not only the GDP income element of the model, but the money
supply, domestic versus global interest rate, government expenditures, and
exchange rates would all become important factors to determine an economy
in equilibrium. It completely altered what was understood for 25 years as an
economy in equilibrium and shifted the IS and LM curves exponentially to
form a new model.
The balance of payments net-export function would change the curves
due to the purchase and sale of foreign securities to complete transactions.
Income would change due to the factors of net exports and the cost of trans-
actions in terms of interest-rate differentials. Both would affect the domestic
and global interest rate and all would affect government expenditures. For the
fi rst time in history, exchange rates and the proper balance of rates were tied
to a macroeconomic view of the world due to capital fl ows across borders. No
longer would economies be viewed from an inward perspective without the
consideration of Mundell-Fleming. Robert Mundell would receive the Nobel
Prize in Economics in 1999 for this model, and would later become instru-
mental in the development of the forward market.
While these models were presented in their basic form to understand
the historical aspects of the development of exchange rates and all have their
critics because the gold standard was still in effect in 1962, Mundell-Fleming
set the world on a new course of study for governments, researchers, traders,
professionals, and academics to understand exchange rates in terms of the
balance-of-payment model. Nearly 50 years after this valuation model was
introduced, world governments and international organizations adopted a
reasonably uniform standard of a balance-of-payment model employed not
only to determine trade but to gauge the proper balance of exchange rates.
The effects of Mundell-Fleming are still a crucial element of the international
system today.
U.S. Current and Capital Account
For the United States, the two most important components of the balance
of payment are the Current and Capital Accounts. The Current Account

==================================================

34 Inside the Currency Market
measures trade in goods and services based on infl ows and outfl ows, a stan-
dard measure that traces back to the classical model. It is a measure of the
value of imports to exports. The term merchandise trade is used by the popular
media to characterize these numbers.
Next, the Capital Account measures the total outfl ow of net capital
account payments. Income Accounts measure receipts and payments of
foreign-owned assets in the United States and U.S.-owned foreign assets.
The last category is the unilateral account that includes transfer payments
to foreigners, such as grants. Together, a trade defi cit or surplus is derived
and released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis every three months and an
exchange rate is determined by the markets based on the released fi gure.
A defi cit or surplus will see a revaluation among spot currency pairs to
refl ect the increase or decrease in prices among nations. A surplus will see a
devaluation of the U.S. dollar while a defi cit will see appreciation to refl ect
the various degrees of price. The U.S. dollar has an inverse relationship to its
economic releases.
With price variables, the theory is that eventually equilibrium in the
trade balance will reach parity as prices adjust to the reported defi cit or sur-
plus within nations. Due to the many variables in the above models such as
GDP, prices, income, and interest rates, many models to gauge spot prices
developed over the years to streamline the various factors.
The long-run model and one popularized by Keynes is the monetary
approach with a focus on elasticities highlighted by demand. This approach
is generated by government money and investments that create societal
demand. Critics would argue that it eliminates the focus on capital fl ows,
so many would rule out the possibility to fi nd equilibrium within the above
variables and a proper exchange rate.
The Austrian School of Economics popularized by Von Mises and more
recently Von Hayek in the 1940s would argue cash balances, income, and
prices rather than GDP, money supply, or price levels is the equilibrium
determination.
Milton Friedman and the early Monetarists School of Economics
believed monies should target the money supply on a weekly basis in rising
and falling economies to fi nd equilibrium. While these arguments may
appear outdated, the Monetarists actually won the argument by adoption
when Ronald Reagan became president in 1980. Von Hayek, Keynes, and
Friedman still live within today’s economic studies because their research
forms the foundation of today’s worldwide economic system.
Von Hayek and Ludwig Von Mises are descendents of the Austrian School of
Economics, an offspring that dates its history to Thomas Aquinas in the fi fteenth

century. The last argument not considered until now are nations such as Canada
and the United States that traditionally ran defi cits knowingly and willingly.
The argument suggests that foreigners would fi nance defi cits by the pur-
chase of government bonds. The Japanese traditionally ran trade surpluses with
the United States as far back as World War II, while the Europeans and Great
Britain ran surpluses sporadically as defi cits and surpluses waxed and waned
with spot prices. Equilibrium or exchange rates were never factors to consider
in this model.
GDP models to determine equilibrium and exchange rates operate on
the assumption that if surpluses are reported, GDP is greater than consump-
tion, investment and government expenditures, and total income exceeds
investments. A defi cit in the current account means GDP is less than con-
sumption, investment, and government expenditures, and income is then less
than expenditures. All are basic models that nations adopted in a uniform
manner today.
A widely popular model is the Taylor Rule where i (cid:3) r* (cid:5) pi (cid:5) 0.5
(pi (cid:2) pi*) (cid:5) 0.5 (y minus y*) where p* (cid:3) target infl ation, i (cid:3) nominal fed
funds rate, pi (cid:3) rate of infl ation, y (cid:3) logarithm of real output and y* (cid:3) log
potential output. No coherent equation can be derived without Gustav
Cassel, considered the founder of purchasing power parity (PPP), also termed
the Law of One Price.
Purchasing Power Parity
Swedish Economist Gustav Cassel set out in the early 1920s to determine
a true exchange rate between nations at various price levels when the gold
standard broke down at the outbreak of World War I. Exchange rates were
allowed to free fl oat, causing an anomaly never understood—infl ation. The
Law of One Price asks the question how much does a tradeable good in nation
A cost in relation to nation B? The Law of One Price says goods expressed in
one price in one market should sell for the same price in another market or
an arbitrage would exist to equalize prices.
Suppose a bushel of wheat costs $15 in the United States and $30 in
Japan. The spot price of wheat in United States divided by the price of wheat
in Japan is equal to $15 U.S. dollars divided by $30 Japan is equal to a 0.50
exchange rate. This is termed absolute purchasing power parity. It is a mea-
sure of price levels. The formula:
Spot Rate (cid:3) Price in nation A/Price in nation B

is an implied rate that will determine if one side of a spot pair will appreciate
or depreciate based on the price of goods and the Law of One Price. It is a
measure to determine and possibly encounter misalignments and equilibrium
from the previous examples. Cassel believed that either the exchange rate or
purchasing power would adjust until parity existed.
Relative purchasing power parity measures the real effective exchange
rate (REER) measured by infl ation between two nations. Suppose infl ation
in Nation A was 8 percent and 2 percent in Nation B. REER is supposed to
refl ect the difference and the market will equalize the rates. The formula is:
Real Effective Exchange Rate (cid:3) (Actual Exchange rate P foreign price)/
P domestic price
Cassel believed the higher prices in one nation, the lower the purchasing
power. His absolute PPP example is a measure of price levels, while the relative
PPP compares price changes. The relative PPP is employed today by central
bankers because it refl ects market conditions and spot rates more quickly than
the absolute method, especially if the correct price index is used as the gauge.
OECD-Eurostat PPP Program
Since the 1960s, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) in conjunction with Eurostat established the PPP Program to deter-
mine exchange rates for euro zone- and OECD-member nations. 2008 marks
the ninth round of the PPP (OECD 2010).
The program gauges exchange rates among nations by a comparison of
prices paid for products and services between nations’ GDPs. By a compari-
son of prices paid within the basket of goods measured for GDP, the PPP
Program can determine an approximation of the health of an economy in
terms of future GDP levels and exchange rates.
With fl oating exchange rates, a whole new body of knowledge has devel-
oped over the years to explore the validity of Cassel’s PPP, only to determine
that prices may equalize in terms of exchange rates but would take a few years
to do so and that would depend on the spot pair. Some pairs can fi nd imbal-
ances for many years. Another factor is the measure of prices employed.
Suppose relative PPP through the REER was employed against the
Consumer Price Index (CPI) that measures infl ation. The International
Monetary Fund (IMF), central banks, and other world organizations use

the REER approach against a basket of trade weights. The weightings could
be a number of factors that incorporate REER such as the GDP defl ator,
producer prices, wholesale prices, or manufacturing output because of its
focus on infl ation. The OECD reports that every 10 percent fall in the euro
trade weighted exchange rate lifts nominal output 1.8 percent. Real effective
exchange rates are usually factored as:
Q (cid:3) S-P (cid:5) P to represent a spot rate in
t t 1,t 1,t
logs in relation to quantity to price
The monetarists approach represented by Von Hayek to exchange rates
and equilibrium can be defi ned by the equation
Spot rate (cid:3) V (cid:4) Y (cid:4) MS
where
V (cid:3) Velocity of money, domestic (cid:4) foreign,
Y (cid:3) Real Output, and
MS (cid:3) Money supply.
Spot (cid:3) (Vd/Vf) (cid:4) (Yf/Yd) (cid:4) (MSd/MSf)
Von Hayek believed this formula would maintain a stable price, provided
that the speed of velocity of money was orderly without the production of
infl ation.
Irving Fisher introduced the Fisher Effect and the International Fisher
Effect in the 1930s to further gauge the correct spot-currency price based
on infl ation. Infl ation is a measure of the general price level. High infl ation
erodes the purchasing power of money by its ability to purchase fewer goods
and services. This can only be measured by interest rates.
The Fisher Effect says the nominal interest rate is equal to the real rate
plus the expected rate. Suppose the interest rate in Nation A was 8 percent
and Nation B was 5 percent and the expected rate was 2 percent. The real rate
would be 1 percent. The International Fisher Effect then compares spot rates
based on infl ation. The formula is:
E (cid:2) E /E (cid:4) 100 (cid:3) 1$ (cid:2) 1 yen
1 2 2

Conclusion
This chapter addressed quite detailed concepts in terms of currency pairs,
margin, rollover, brokers, and histories as they relate to exchange rates and
PPP. It is the basic chapter to understand how exchange rates factor within
the larger concept of today’s currency market. More important is the concept
of how a currency and how currency pairs are viewed in the context of each
nation that it trades. This chapter was the foundation as currency pairs will
begin the process to be priced in the traded markets. Now that an exchange
rate is understood, the next chapter will address theories and foundation of
effective exchange rates.

CHAPTER 3
Exchange Rates and
Trade Weight Indices
This chapter will address all the necessary conditions and formulas to
understand a true exchange rate and factor that true rate in terms of a bas-
ket of currencies in an index based on weights in the index according to each
nation’s currency and weight. These are known as trade weight indices (TWIs).
To factor another nations’s currency in a TWI sometimes holds the key to
gauging the proper levels of exchange rates between nations. Many formulas
and index-construction methodologies are provided for each nation to allow
a true picture of an exchange rate but enough information is provided to
allow anyone to form their own desired index.
The last factor of exchange-rate determination is to survey real-world
examples of individual nations and ascertain how they factor real effective
Exchange Rates (REER) in relation to their TWI, also known as an effective
exchange rate index.
Effective exchange rates are employed so one nation can measure trade
against a basket of weights assigned to another nation’s currency in the index.
This process can be managed on a daily basis much more easily than manag-
ing the volatility of spot rates. To manage spot rates means the market must
be monitored on a constant basis around the clock so entries and exits can
be obtained in relation to a preferred spot price in order to lock in a rate to
export a good. Days may pass before a market price can be obtained.
The REER formula in its basic yet effective form is employed and
factored as a basic purchasing power parity (PPP) model by

because it is the preferred method for central bankers and world organizations
due to its focus on infl ation and as a more rapid measure of changes to prices
within nations. The measure is a spot price in logs in relation to quantity and
price within a nation. The formula can be rewritten as
Q (cid:3) Spot (cid:2) p (cid:5) p (cid:4) p

Log spot prices or exchange rates always allow a truer picture of a price
rather than for example a correlation formula that measures exchange rates in
relation to quantity and price.
TWIs are relatively new and became a function of fl oating exchange rates
the world has experienced since the breakdown of the Louvre Accords in the
early 1980s. It was the path to determine exact dollar terms of merchandise
trade, identify trade partners, and effects on spot prices. The fi rst constructed
indices for some nations were fairly primitive, but today the importance and
value of a nation’s spot price and the importance of TWIs are a vital func-
tion of a central bank and the nation it serves. It gauges an overall economic
picture of a nation even when that picture is not so clear.
For example, too high a spot price may mean a nation may gain in their
exports but gain nothing in their imports. What if the spot price of the U.S.
dollar/Japanese yen was 125 yen to dollars? Japanese vehicles sold in the
United States would sell at a high value. That’s great for the Japanese because
they earn revenue. Now the Japanese repatriate their monies home and they
fi nd an overabundance in the supply of yen. This overabundance of yen leads
to an erosion of prices in Japan and defl ation takes over. The true purchas-
ing power of the yen in Japan erodes as new money loses its value to old
money. Credit then paid in new money deteriorates against the old money.
So the Japanese lower their prime interest rate to accommodate consumers. But
the Japanese continue to export and earn even more revenue. The downward
spiral continues; as interest rates drop so does the value of the yen.
In a different example, defl ationary yen is exported while infl ationary
yen is repatriated home instead of the reverse scenario. In this instance, a balance
must be found, an equilibrium of spot rates that is conducive to both export
revenue and consumer health. This is one reason why PPP failed as a model
under fl oating exchange rates because every nation has economic factors that
may not match against another nation’s economy.
Japan is dependent on trade but it must import the resources for its
manufacturers in order to export those goods, so it may never experience
parity against the United States nor any nation under their normal trade
circumstances. To defl ect this conundrum, Japanese companies established
satellites in all the major export nations of Japan to alleviate a defl ationary

environment at home. Japan in 2007 began to then view their currency as
fair effective exchange rate (FEER) rather than REER. FEER allows a target
range that is set by the markets due to world interest rates among the major
nations at their historically low levels and monetary policy contained within
those levels. The answer to this conundrum for nations was TWIs.
TWIs forced nations to view their economies from an import and export
perspective of competitiveness. From an export perspective, nations deter-
mined their strengths, resources, major companies, cost of production, export
goods and services, trading partners, and revenues earned from exports.
Imports determined necessary resources for the health of the economy and
the general population.
Many nations rely on export revenue to fund their domestic needs.
Central banks of each nation were tasked with construction of a proper index,
the correct measures employed to ensure a timely monetary policy that would
balance infl ation against change in prices and imports to exports based on
exchange rates. Due to the uniqueness of various economies, TWIs vary in
size, scope, and measures.
When indices were fi rst constructed in the 1970s, factors such as fi xed
and fl oating exchange rates and taxes and tariffs had to be considered. Major
trading nations today are quite different from those considered in the early
1970s. China is one nation that factors into this equation, but a whole host
of emerging-market nations now exist as trading partners that weren’t consid-
ered in the 1970s.
With the introduction of the euro in 1997, all nations overhauled their indi-
ces to refl ect new trading arrangements. The standard indexes constructed then
remain the common practice today, with an annual review by all central banks.
One difference is the overhaul of indices around 2005 by nations to
refl ect a growing need to include services in trade calculations. An advanced
trader could possibly factor a balance-of-payment determination and profi t
as the TWI is factored on a daily basis and released at the same time every
day. The release is a factor of the price of the respective nations’ exchange
rate against the U.S. dollar for the most part. Yet cross rates play an equally
important role.
Think of these indices as a measure of one currency against a basket
of other currencies. It is an external measure of prices as the Consumer
Price Index (CPI) is an internal measure of prices. Think about the spot
yen or euro that may trend upward against the U.S. dollar but trend down
against another currency. The implication for overall direction of the trend
of exchange rates against a basket of currencies says much in regard to overall
direction of the yen or euro and may bring into question or reinforce the
intensity of that trend.

42 Inside the Currency Market
What infl uences any TWI is spot and other market rates. Yet what infl u-
ences spot is any TWI and other market rates such as short-term interest
rates. This is why market rates are monitored constantly by central bankers—
their economies depend on healthy rates.
The TWI fl uctuates on a daily basis and on occasion it trends because it is
a measure of a nation’s internal cost and external price competitiveness. That
trend is real because it is gauged against a basket of currencies. A high index
number says cost measures may be too high for the health of an economy. In
other instances, a high index number may be appropriate. Fixing times occur
daily at a predetermined time.
For example, New Zealand fi xes its TWI at 11:10 a.m. Wellington time.
This means the daily funding for contracts is paid at 11:10 a.m. New Zealand
time, 7:10 p.m. eastern daylight time. Great Britain publishes its rates on its
Exchange Rate Index (ERI) every two hours London time with a close at 4:00 p.m.
London time, 10:00 a.m. New York time. Trade weight numbers reported
throughout any trading day are called indicative rates and will be covered in
the next sequence. The euro zone is one circumstance where the reported trade
numbers are reported as a reference rate, also covered in the next section.
Trade-Weight Methodology
The fi rst question for any nation is how should an index be constructed to refl ect
imports and exports with trading partners and who should be included? Also, how
should competitiveness of nations and prices be refl ected? Should a nation target
infl ation, prices, exchange rates, reserves, interest rates, or none of the above?
Central banks fi rst constructed nation weights that included trading partners.
Each nation receives a share of its value to trade within the index. Some
nations use trade shares, others utilize a percentage. Some nations fi x their
weights; others use a chained-link index. Some nations report an offi cial
index and quantify that index against a broader list of cross rates within the
offi cial index so that a market event doesn’t capsize the index and the offi cial
reported fi gure is correct.
Broader indices are backdated and tested against the U.S. dollar and
against other price measures to ensure integrity of the offi cial reported num-
ber. Cross rates are always tested by home nation/trade partner.
The derivation of cross pairs occurred in the 1990s as new nations
became members of import and export markets and the U.S. dollar wasn’t a
factor in those exchanges. Think about the Japanese that export to the euro
zone. The euro/Japanese yen is more of a factor in the transaction than the
U.S. dollar. Prior to cross pairs, only U.S. dollar pairs existed, so money

was repatriated through a triangulation of euro/U.S. dollar to Japanese yen/
U.S. dollar. Cross pairs eliminated the U.S. dollar and streamlined imports,
exports, and repatriations. An extraordinary amount of money depends on
the accuracy of index numbers.
Some indices measure strictly bilateral trade, others incorporate a variable
to capture a competitor’s competition by a chain link. This is the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) approach, and it fi rst incorporated this model when
it became a formal organization at the signing of Bretton Woods in 1944.
The IMF monitors world trade by its own trade weight index. All IMF mem-
bers are listed in the index and held together by a chain link.
Some nations fi x their indices once daily, others fi x throughout the day
at regular market intervals. All report daily index prices on their central bank
sites. All report historical prices. An index is used because spot prices are too
volatile for true evaluation of trade, price, and exchange-rate measures.
What is incorporated is a price index that measures the rate of change of
prices over time based on a base period. Proper measurement incorporates
number theory as not only a measure of prices as quantifi ed, but a scale factor
must be incorporated. Which index to employ as a true measure depends on
the quantifi cation of the index and the scale factor. Some indices are fi xed,
some are chain weighted. Research suggests chain-weighted indices work best
because of their gauge against another economic index, but as periods move
further out from their base years, problems may develop in their accuracy.
So they must be adjusted every few years. An example of CPI as a scale factor
works like this following formula.
∑n
V = (cid:3) PiQi
i(cid:3)1
where
pi (cid:3) ith item in national currency units,
qi (cid:3) corresponding quantity in the time period, and
i (cid:3) ith item in the group of n that comprise the aggregate v.
The question is the base period.
In 1871, Ernst Louis Etienne Laspeyres invented this practical formula:
∑ Pii,t
Pi,oWi,o
i ∑ , wi,o =pi,oqi,o
wi,o
i
This is a weighted average of price ratios of each item weighted by expen-
ditures at the base period. Quantities are fi xed at the base period.

Along came Hermann Paasche in 1874 and identifi ed this formula:
∑p q
i,t i,t
p q
i,o i,t
i
For individual item i, price at the base period to be pi/o, at observation
period to be pi/t and quantity at the base period to be qi/t.
The denominator and numerator are total expenditures for all items
at the base and observation period. Quantities are fi xed at the observation
period. Earlier fi xed-weight formulas were identifi ed in 1823 by Joseph Lowe,
considered the father of the CPI Index.
The formula is:
Pl (P, P, Q )
o o t b
This formula compares prices in a base month O, P, with those in month
o
t, P using a quantity vector O, Q as weights.

Others came along in the 1920s such as Irving Fisher and Correa MoylanWalsh
to further build on Lowe, Laspeyres, Paasche, and others to form more
advanced models. The difference between older and newer indices is the older
indexes fi x weight using an arithmetic mean while the newer indices use a
chain link or fi x weight with a geometric mean.

Exchange Rates and Trade Weight Indices 45
Nominal effective exchange rates are then utilized and factored against
each nation’s currency. Think of this as Cassel’s Absolute PPP. Why nominal
effective exchange rates? So the index isn’t jolted by one nation that may have,
for example, a high infl ation rate against other index members’ currency or
a one-nation calamity won’t shake the index price. Further, the nominal rate
is used because whatever scale is utilized to measure the index against other
nominal exchange rates can be defl ated. Nations have various scale factors.
New Zealand scales its index based on the nation’s GDP, while some
nations scale their index based on the CPI to measure prices and infl ation at
the same time. Some use producer prices. Australia utilizes a price defl ater.
The reason for defl ating the scale against nominal exchange rates is to capture
the REER accurately. And this is our intention, to capture the true rate to
understand further the spot rate.
REERs can only be factored on a monthly basis as nations release their
economic reports. Economic reports are then scaled against the respective
index to form a REER. In many instances, this occurs at month end and a
time to really watch exchange rates as refunding and refactoring efforts occur.
Central banks must replenish their supply of foreign and domestic currencies
in the spot market, termed reserve diversifi cation. Month end is important
in the spot market because it may experience volatility due to rebalancing.
All nations have various methods and reasons for managing their economies,
and that reason is measured within their index.
Following is a list of the major trading nations and their index con-
struction and formulas. One will notice that variations exist from central
bank to central bank. The determination is to consider a REER based on
the given data methodology in order to profi t. It also helps to know that all
central banks report their TWI factored numbers directly on their web site
every day while some emerging market nations, if they have a TWI, do not.
While all nations report single-index numbers, it is important that each indi-
vidual nation within the index is also reported along with their historic rates. This
is not only where a trend can be found, but in which pair, what direction, and how
far can also be determined. Following is a list of each major nation, major trading
partners, percentages for each partner within the index, trade strategies, and major
exports. This is all the necessary information to evaluate a spot-trade decision.
Further, the indices listed are the foundation for all modern-day indices
in terms of factoring consumer price indices for many nations: Paasche in
particular is employed by Japan and New Zealand, for example. The United
States employs a Laspeyres Index with a geometric mean to factor the 8,018
CPI items in their index.
Some nations factor stock market indices based on Laspeyres while
others factor balance of payments using one of the previously discussed

indexes. Slight variations may exist from nation to nation, but the basic for-
mulas haven’t changed since inception. The measure for all indices is the rela-
tionship between quantity and price and the means to handle an exorbitant
amount of items. No limits exist with the proper index.
Finally, a spot trade against a TWI must always be factored as home
currency/foreign currency. Both can be confi rmed as foreign currency/
home currency. As one pair bottoms, the other tops.
Australia
Australia adopted a free-fl oat currency in December 1983. The Australian
dollar was pegged against the British pound from 1971 to 1974, then against
the U.S. dollar for many years. At one point, the Australian dollar was
employed as a crawling peg to their TWI. A peg to the United Kingdom
meant that Australia’s dollar would almost mimic the moves of the British
pound while a crawling peg meant that any exchange-rate movement in the
Australian dollar would be adjusted with their TWI due to the fi xed nature of
that index. This however caused volatility swings so Australia adopted their
trade weight index in 1974 and revised it in 1988 to refl ect their free-fl oat
status.
Based on 2008 and 2009 trade weight data, Australia’s TWI was com-
prised of 22 currencies that refl ected 93.2 percent of imports and exports
with 22 nations.

Exports include coal, iron ore, crude, aluminum, copper, zinc, gold,
nickel, wheat, sugar, wool, beef, and milk powder to name the vast major-
ity of commodities listed in Australia’s Index of Commodity Prices. Crude
accounts for 5 percent of total export commodity receipts. This constitutes
Australia in the category of a commodity currency based on IMF standards
of 50 percent exports of commodities.
From 1970 to 1988, Australia calculated its index based on an arith-
metic mean. Since 1988, a geometric mean has been used. Australia’s TWI
is based on trade shares of the 22 nations with which it trades. If Australia
conducts 20 percent of its trade with the United States, the United States
would receive a factor that represents 20 percent trade in its TWI. Each
trading partner receives a percentage of trade shares to eventually normalize
the index to equal 100 although that may not always occur because of an
occasional import or export from a nation outside the index. The goal is to
reach proximity to 100.
Formulas are calculated using REER based on a ratio of the implicit price
defl ator for exports and imports of goods and services. Australia factors price
defl ators two different ways to ensure integrity of the fi nal index number.
For the fi rst method, divide current price estimates by constant price esti-
mates for imports and exports. The base period is 1989 to 1990 and is equal
to 100. For the second method, divide imports by exports. Finally, Australia

calculates consumer prices, unit labor costs, and the GDP defl ator as a ratio
of Australia’s “cost measure against the weighted geometric average of the
exchange rate adjusted cost measures”. The base period is 1989 to 1990 and
is equal to 100. An increase in the index says cost measures are too high and
must be adjusted. What is most important in Australia’s calculation is the
factor of exchange rates.

Another view works like this. The index is a ratio of the Australian cost
or price weighted to the geometric average of the exchange-rate adjusted price
or cost measure of Australia’s trade partners with an Index equal to 100. An

facturing. The trade partner weights are:

The TWI fi x occurs at 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Australia time, 7:00 p.m.
EDT and 1:00 a.m. EDT.
New Zealand
One of the most advanced central bankers among the family of nations is by far
New Zealand. With passage of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act in 1989
and the Markets Act in 1988, New Zealand was one of the fi rst nations to target
infl ation within a range, leading other nations to follow suit. New Zealand is
also known for its high quality and always-reliable cutting-edge research.
New Zealand’s dollar, called the Kiwi, free fl oated in March 1985. Yet New
Zealand fi rst introduced its fi ve-nation TWI in 1979. That TWI accounted
for its fi ve major trading partners, the United States, Great Britain, Japan,
Germany, and Australia. With the introduction of the euro, the deutsche
mark was replaced to hold the index at fi ve nations.
With increased import and export trade from a whole host of nations
and the introduction of cross pairs, New Zealand expanded the size of its
TWI in 1997 to cover 14 nations’ currency cross rates. But this index remains
separate from the original and offi cial fi ve-nation index. This method allows
New Zealand to capture market highs and lows more accurately and ensure
integrity of the offi cial reported fi gure (Kite 2004).
Before 1997, New Zealand targeted infl ation as a measure of its exchange
rate, but the weight of the TWI was based strictly on trade shares, the same
method Australia currently employs. When TWI prediction errors occurred
by an under- or overforecast of exchange rates, New Zealand changed the
index-construction methodology (Kite 2004).
New Zealand now employs a 50-50 methodology: 50 percent of the
index comprises trade shares based on a nation’s share of imports and exports
with New Zealand, while the other 50 percent is based on each currency
area’s share of the combined nominal GDP of the fi ve-currency area. New
Zealand uses this methodology because of a belief that trade shares alone
didn’t capture infl ation in New Zealand and in the larger economies of their
trade partners (Kite 2004). GDP allows New Zealand to measure prices and
infl ation, especially infl ation in the medium term, a direct and indirect effect
on exchange rates. Further, GDP methodology allows New Zealand to cap-
ture third-nation competition by a chain link. This method was derived from

the IMF’s methodology. GDP shares are calculated using GDP in the local
currency then converted into U.S. dollars.
New Zealand employs export weights based on GDP volumes and con-
verts to index form with a base period set to 1995 Q1 to equal 100. Export
weights are expressed as a portion of the partners in the index. A Fisher Ideal
Index is then employed because it captures the geometric mean of Laspeyres
and Paasche. The formula is:

Australia accounts for 21 percent of trade with New Zealand and is the
largest trade partner followed by euro zone 15 percent, U.S. 14 percent, Japan
10.5 percent, and China 5 percent. 71 percent of New Zealand’s exports
are shipped to APEC nations such as Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada,
Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico,
Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Taipei, Thailand, the
United States, and Vietnam. New Zealand’s major exports include milk pow-
der, salted butter, cheese, logs, wood, and crude.
The most important pairs to New Zealand are New Zealand dollar/U.S.
dollar, New Zealand dollar/euro, New Zealand dollar/Japanese yen, New
Zealand dollar/British pound and New Zealand dollar/Australian dollar.
Notice the relationship with New Zealand dollar/Australian dollar for New
Zealand and Australian dollar/New Zealand dollar for Australia. Both are
major trade partners to each other and both want to reap the benefi ts of
their respective trade. Australian dollar/New Zealand dollar is the normal

always expect volatility. Australian dollar/New Zealand dollar is an espe-
cially volatile pair due to push and pulls by each nation who vie for a certain

Zealand time, 7:00 p.m. New York time.

Notice the wide differentiation of time and the disconnection to the
American markets. To connect to American markets and especially money
markets, New Zealand introduced its BKBM 14:00 fi x on July 1, 2008.
The BKBM is New Zealand’s Bank Bill and represents the shortest interest
rate in New Zealand that encompasses Certifi cates of Deposit and Bills of
Exchange.
The BKBM rate is connected to the New Zealand dollar/ U.S. dollar
and the various rates between the two nations. The formal name is the
World Markets Company WM/Reuters New Zealand Fix and reported as
B1 rates on the New Zealand Central Bank site, one of the easiest and
most user-friendly central bank sites. The 14:00 fi x refers to 2:00 a.m. New
Zealand time, 10:00 a.m. New York time to refl ect a 16-hour difference in
time. The purpose of the new fi x was to secure a benchmark rate for cur-
rencies used in contracts and to connect with the forward market in other
time zones.
Nine currencies are factored as mid rates, U.S. dollar, British pound,
Hong Kong dollar, Singapore dollar, Australian dollar, Swiss franc, Canadian
dollar, euro, and Japanese yen. Approved banks offer buy and sell rates on
one- to six-month maturities that are representative rates for New Zealand’s
Prime Bank Bill, the top interest rate.
A January 2010 development is the fi x during New Zealand mar-
ket-trading hours for the following currency pairs: New Zealand dollar/
Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar/Canadian dollar, New Zealand
dollar/Swiss franc, New Zealand dollar/euro, New Zealand dollar/British
pound, New Zealand dollar/Hong Kong dollar, New Zealand dollar/
Japanese yen and New Zealand dollar/Singapore dollar. The purpose of
the fi x is to set a price for contracts settled between New Zealand and the
respective nations. It allows for the TWI to be more accurate. See Exhibit
3.1 for an historic view of New Zealand’s TWI as it tracks New Zealand
dollar/U.S. dollar.
Japan
Japan is a nation that must rely on its exports because it lacks natural resources.
Commodities such as oil are crucial elements that must be imported to fuel
the machinery of Japan’s productive processes.

What held Japan together as a nation through the centuries was its focus
on education, which became a boon for their manufacturers. Because exports
are so vital to the Japanese economy, the records and statistics to evaluate their
exports and ensure a proper level of exchange rates are phenomenally detailed.
Today, Japan’s largest export trading partner is China followed by the
United States. The Japanese yen began a free fl oat in 1973 under the Nixon
administration that forced currencies off the gold standard. In order to earn a
place on Japan’s TWI list, at least 1 percent of Japan’s exports must go to that
particular nation. Currently, 15 nations are on the list that covers 87.3 percent
of Japan’s exports: the United States, China, euro zone, Korea, Taiwan, Hong
Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Great Britain, Malaysia, Australia, Indonesia,
Philippines, Canada, and Mexico. Each nation earns a percentage share of the
TWI based on the average export share of each trading partner. This calculation
is factored against Japan’s Domestic Corporate Goods Price Index (DCGPI).
The DCGPI is an index comprised of many indices such as the Import Price
Index, Export Price Index, Commodity Index, and Index by Stage of Demand
and Use. The purpose of this index is to determine supply and demand in the
production process within Japan. The index as a whole is a determination of
domestic produced goods. The DCGPI is calculated based on a chain weight so
it is a continuous calculation. Further, it is calculated minus Japan’s consump-
tion tax. The DCGPI is a regular economic release at the end of every month.
To calculate exchange rates, Japan fi rst calculates a nominal effective
exchange rate. The weighted average calculated as a geometric mean of the
yen’s exchange rate against other nations currencies are calculated using

the annual value of Japan’s trade with other nation’s as weights, then con-
verted into an index. The base period index has equaled 100 since 2005, as
this index is updated every fi ve years.
A real effective exchange rate is then calculated by defl ating the nominal
exchange rate by the DCGPI and the correspondent nation’s indices. For the
United States and most trading partners, producer prices are utilized. China
is factored by the Price Index of Industrial Products with an estimated year-
over-year change. For Australia, manufacturing output is used. The weighted
average is then factored as a geometric mean and calculated using annual
values of Japan’s trade with respective nations as weights, then converted into

Most signifi cant currency pairs to Japan are Japanese yen/U.S. dollar,
Japanese yen/euro, Japanese yen/British pound, Japanese yen/Australian
dollar, Japanese yen/Canadian dollar, Japanese yen/Hong Kong dollar and
Japanese yen/Singapore dollar. Normally pairs are classifi ed for trade and pos-
itive exchange-rate purposes as Japanese yen/Trading Partner to reap the ben-
efi ts of trade and exchange rates. But this is the Japanese, who not only must
export but they must reap the benefi ts of those exports to ensure a healthy
economy. So it is important to watch the Japanese because they calculate to the
nth degree all factors of calculations.
Secondly, the Japanese are probably the world’s best and smartest traders.
For these reasons, the key pairs for any trader to watch are the U.S. dollar/
Japanese yen, euro/Japanese yen, Australian dollar/Japanese yen, Canadian
dollar/Japanese yen, Hong Kong dollar/Japanese yen and Singapore dollar/
Japanese yen. Evaluation of the reverse pairs should always be the fi rst essen-
tial element in any trade evaluation.
Great Britain
Great Britain, like other nations, revamped their ERI trade weight index
in 2004 and implemented it in 2005 to refl ect trade in services. Originally,
its index was based on a fi xed weight but has been revised to incorporate

a chain-linked index, which means that new nation weights had to be recal-
culated. This also meant a formal review of trading partners.
Any nation with a 1 percent trade over a three-year period with the
United Kingdom earned rights on the narrow ERI, the Effective Exchange
Rate Index. Others fell into the 0. 5 category and were listed on the broader
index. For example, the 2004 review revealed that Poland and Russia met the
new criteria and South Korea did not. Russia has since lost but then regained
its right to be listed in the narrow index (Lynch and Whitaker 2004).
The Bank of England (BOE) updates the ERI annually while the Offi ce
of National Statistics calculates Exchange Rates. London is truly the home of
currency trading, so the British pound sterling needs no introduction.
Despite 22 nation’s currencies listed in the ERI, the vast majority of the
index—about 50 percent—comprises trade with the euro zone and 16 percent
with the United States. So the two most important currencies are the British
pound/U.S. dollar and the British pound/euro.
Index weights are published fi ve times daily by the Bank of England in
two hour intervals from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. London time. The nations’
currencies and trade weights factored in the ERI narrow index according to
2009 updates are:

Despite the revamp of the ERI, imports and exports in the United
Kingdom had an abysmal record from 2000 to 2009. The United Kingdom
had more imports than exports of oil from 2005 to 2009 while overall
imports exceeded exports from 2000 to 2009. The top export markets, in
order, for 2009 were the United States, Germany, Netherlands, France,
Ireland, Belgium, Spain, Italy, China, and Sweden. The peak importers for 2009
include Germany, the United States, China, Netherlands, France, Norway,
Belgium, Ireland, Italy, and Spain.
The major commodity exported and imported is oil. Exports include oil,
pharmaceuticals, road vehicles, power equipment, and chemicals. Imports
include oil, road vehicles, offi ce machines, telecommunications equipment,
offi ce machines, clothing, and electrical machinery.

Not only was a chain linked index included in the new ERI but a whole
new methodology was incorporated. The new index now represents third
nation competition just as the model of the IMF. Third nation competition
models capture competition of UK from imports, factors UK exports and
competition in export markets and catches competition between the UK
and competitors from third markets. It is the direct and indirect approach
to trade.
From Whitaker and Lynch 2004, the formula with new weights has three
locations for ERI weights that represent three locations. The formula is:
Wit (cid:3) (cid:6)m, t MW it (cid:5) (cid:6)BX, t Yi BXW ti (cid:5) (cid:6)TX, t TXW ti
where
MW (cid:3) UK Imports,
BXW (cid:3) Bilateral export competition,
TXW (cid:3) Third market competition,
(cid:6)m (cid:3) import competition,
(cid:6)BX (cid:3) Openness of trading partners, and
(cid:6)TX (cid:3) UK home markets supplied by third markets.
Wit (cid:3) total competitiveness weight of trade partner, MW (cid:3) competi-
tion in the UK market from imports, BXW (cid:3) bilateral export market com-
petition weight, TXW (cid:3) 3rd market competition weight, (cid:6) weights (cid:3) (cid:6)m
import competition, proportion of UK total contact with trade partners in
home market, (cid:6)BX (cid:3) trade partners supply competitor home market, (cid:6)TX (cid:3)
home market supplied by third nation competitor.
Weights are assigned trade shares based on trade fl ows. (cid:6) and y are fi xed
elements so exchange rates and trade fl ows are accurately reported.
The new base-year period is 100 from 2005.
An earlier chain-link model by Armington in 1969 looked at the above
formula as:
WJ (cid:3) (Imports of I/Imports and exports of I) (cid:4) (Share of I imports from j)
(cid:5) (Exports of i/Imports and exports of i) (cid:4) Overall export weight
A number of components exist to fi gure exchange rates based on this
model.
The Bank of England releases every month and reports on their web site
a table of effective interest rates thanks to the Bank of England Act of 2001.

It is calculated as a function of average loan/deposit balances and interest pay-
able/receivables on those balances. The formula is:
Interest Flows (cid:4) Number of days in a year (cid:4) 100
Average daily balance Number of days in a month
An effective interest rate is a weighted average of all interest rates across all
the deposit accounts. Viewed another way, this helps to understand England’s
M4 growth rates. Growth rates are equal to the rates of increase or decrease in
a series from one period to the next. For a one-month period,
Y (cid:3) (Flow period/Level period ) (cid:4) 100

The Monetary Conditions Index (MCI) is a weighted average of changes
in an interest rate and exchange rate relative to their values in a base period.
The MCI is employed as a target by central banks or an actual versus a desired
result. It is an indicator and used many ways. For example, the Bank of
England factors LIBOR to the 10-year gilt effective exchange rate or a three-
month Treasury Bill to an effective exchange rate.
The formula is
MCI (cid:3) A(R – R ) (cid:5) A(Q – Q )
t r t b s t b
where
R (cid:3) the short-term real interest rate,
t
Q (cid:3) the log of the real exchange rate – the rise (cid:3) appreciation,
t
R and Q (cid:3) the level of interest rate and exchange rate in a base
b b
period, and
A and A (cid:3) MCI’s weights with the ratio A/A refl ecting the impact
r s r s
of interest and exchange rates.
A percent point rise in Rf has the same impact on the goal A percent

real appreciation of the domestic currency. A ratio of 3 to 1 (A (cid:3) 3,
r
A (cid:3) 1) says a 1 percent point change in the short-term real interest
s
rate has the same effect on the policy goal as a 3 percent change in the
real exchange rate.
The ERI is factored in terms of GDP growth, CPI to measure infl ation,
rates of change, and interest rates. ERI growth rates are then projected three
years into the future. The Bank of England anticipated an 83.2 ERI in 2010,
85.3 in 2011, and 85.3 in 2012.

Trade Strategy
The most crucial pairs to England are the British pound/U.S. dollar and
British pound/euro due to their abundance of trade.
A fall in the ERI Index is a fall in spot prices while a rise in the ERI is a rise
in spot prices. For example, when the housing crisis hit in August 2008, British
pound/U.S. dollar spot was trading at 2.0500 while the ERI began the month
at 93. By the end of August, spot fell to 1.4536 and the ERI was at 88.58
by the end of August. Spot fell 1.4 percent while the ERI fell 1.04 percent, an
enormous correlation. When the Greek crisis hit, British pound/U.S. dollar
spot traded at 1.5150 on May 4, 2010, and ended 1.4536 with a touch at
4500 on May 14, 2010, while the ERI began at 79.5064 on May 4, 2010, and
ended at 78.8207 on May 13, 2010. May 14 was a Friday and ERI was not yet
reported.
What are the consequences to the ERI and spot prices at these levels?
Notice the correlation in the fi rst example. What occurs with prices paid
by British consumers, what occurs with the cost structure to the British
government, what occurs with their fi nance cost, what occurs with trade
fi gures, and how is the money supply affected are all determinants of the
ERI. The overall question is where does supply equal demand or demand
equal supply?
Matthew Hurd, Mark Salmon, and Christopher Schleicher published a
2005 paper in the Center for Economic Policy Research entitled “Using
Copulas to Construct Bivariate Foreign Exchange Distributions with
Application to ERI” in which they determine ERI exchange rates based on
option risk reversals by factoring Bernstein Copulas. This methodology has
since been adopted and regularly reported in the Quarterly Bulletin every
quarter since 2005.
Sweden
The Danish krona free fl oated in November 1992 as they unpegged against
the ECU. Currently, 21 nations are incorporated in their Trade Competitive
Weight Index (TCW). But the Swedish Central Bank, Risbank, factors rates
for 50 nations as well as cross rates. Cross rates are factored for and against
the Swedish krona. Their TCW is factored the same as Great Britain and the
IMF where exports, imports, and third-market competition is included. They
factor their exchange rates as Buy plus Sell divided by two. Exchange rates are
reported at 9:30 a.m. Stockholm time and reported at 10:00 a.m. as mid rates
Stockholm time, 4:00 a.m. New York time.

Canada
Canada revised their old C-6 and G-10 Index in 2006 to refl ect the change in
trade conditions that refl ected trade in services as well as new trading partners.
Today that index is called Canada Effective Exchange Rate Index (CERI) and
refl ects six nations’ currencies based on 2 percent trade or higher with Canada:
U.S. dollar, euro, British pound, Japanese yen, Chinese renminbi, and the
Mexican peso. The weights in the index work like this: U.S. dollar 0.7618,
euro 0.0931, yen 0.0527, renminbi 0.0329, peso 0.0324, and British pound
0.0271. The United States by far holds the largest position in the index due to
the enormous import and export business between the two nations.
The United States accounts for 0.7618 of the index so the Canadian
dollar/U.S. dollar and the spot U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar are by far the
most important pairs for Canada as the Canadian dollar moves almost in lock
step with the U.S. dollar. Because Canada is ranked as the world’s seventh-
largest oil exporter, Canadian dollar/Japanese yen is a great oil trade because
this pair tracks so well with the price of oil. Approximately $100 billion in
Canadian dollars are traded on any given trading day.
Canada’s major exports are wheat, petroleum, natural gas, lumber, met-
als, chemicals, plastics, fertilizers, agricultural machinery, and automotive
products. The effective rates fi xing time is between 12:15 and 12:30 eastern
time or New York time. The index is factored against each nation’s CPI except
China, which always receives an approximation. The index formula is the
exact same as England, the IMF, and Sweden as all account for third-market
competition, as can be seen in Exhibit 3.2, a 2007 to 2010 chart of CERI
against Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar.
Switzerland
A minor polemic exists in Switzerland because of their limited translation of
offi cial documents and research publications to English. Most are published
in French and German, refl ecting historic ties to both nations that date to
the Middle Ages. Most important government documents are published in
German, representing the capital in Zurich in southern Switzerland, while
North Switzerland represents French areas such as Geneva.
Four currencies represent prime economic value for Switzerland because
these currencies comprise the majority of trade with Switzerland. In order of
importance, Swiss franc/euro, Swiss franc/U.S. dollar, Swiss franc/Japanese
yen, and Swiss franc/British pound. Switzerland’s index is titled the TWI.
The fi xing time for these currencies is 11:00 a.m. Zurich, 5:00 a.m. New
York. The following effective rates are reported in order of importance: Swiss

franc/euro, Swiss franc/U.S. dollar, Swiss franc/Japanese yen, and Swiss franc/

Notice the relationship Swiss franc/U.S. dollar. This order is by far more
important to the health of Switzerland’s trade with the United States than
the U.S. dollar/Swiss franc pair offered by most brokers. Switzerland would
much prefer to see a rise in Swiss franc/U.S. dollar rather than a rise in U.S.
dollar/Swiss franc, especially during times of market and economic stress.
francs are earned by Swiss franc/U.S. dollar.
When U.S. dollar/Swiss franc rises to levels not acceptable to the Swiss
Central Bank, they will intervene and drive those prices down so any U.S.
dollar/Swiss franc longs should always be treated with caution. Consequently,
Swiss franc/euro for Switzerland is their most important pair due to the over-
whelming trade they conduct with the euro zone. Most brokers offer euro/
Swiss franc. Both central banks play a push and pull tug-of-war game as they
vie for the correct pricing mechanism within this pair.
Exports to the euro zone comprise by far a vast majority of trade for
Switzerland. Following is a list of top import and exports nations in 2009
for Switzerland.

Trade Strategy
For all of 2009, the Swiss exported more to the United States than it imported.
On January 1, 2009, the effective rate for the Swiss franc against the U.S. dollar
was 1.0852 and ended December 2009 at 1.0283. Spot U.S. dollar/Swiss
franc began trade January 1, 2009, at 1.2271 and ended the year at 0.9852.
Where the Swiss profi ted was Swiss franc/U.S. dollar since effective rates are
quoted for the TWI in this manner. Where a spot trader profi ts goes either
way. The same scenario occurs with the Japanese yen.
On January 1, 2009, the effective rate began the year at 1.1610 and
ended the year at 1.1463. The Swiss franc/Japanese yen began trade January
1, 2009 at 87.144 and ended the year at 90.725. The sell yen and buy Swiss
franc was a profi table strategy throughout 2009. One caveat is that this pair
was never known for its big movements. Another signifi cant pair is euro/
Swiss franc or aptly quoted by the Swiss as Swiss franc/euro.
Intervention
An important caveat to consider in any trade strategy is that all central banks
value, and heavily monitor daily, the price of their currencies of interest against
their TWIs to ensure profi table trade fl ows to earn foreign reserves for the govern-
ment and to ensure profi ts for each nation’s export companies. When a currency
pair reaches critical levels unsatisfactory to a central bank’s trade fl ows, spot-market
intervention is always a possibility to bring prices back to profi table levels.
Central banks intervene in the markets all the time, ready to spend the
necessary amounts, so risk always exists for a bet against the direction of a

==================================================

Exchange Rates and Trade Weight Indices 63
currency pair in which a central bank has an interest. Many can’t compete
with the amount of money central banks are willing to spend to intervene.
Central banks such as New Zealand and Australia usually utter a verbal
warning in some form before intervention with hope that the market will
adhere to the warning so that intervention won’t be necessary. In this instance,
the market corrects itself and in the interim, an easy and profi table trade may
exist. Others such as the Swiss and the Japanese have been known to inter-
vene without warning. Yet the Japanese have not intervened signifi cantly in
recent years due to rearrangement of offshore tactics such as the establishment
of Japanese companies in other nations, purchase of commodities in other
nations’ markets, and a new repatriation system that allows companies to now
become profi table so foreign-exchange risk to the yen is reduced.
The Swiss however have intervened many times with signifi cant amounts
of money to gear their currencies of interest in their desired direction. Recent
interventions occurred in early morning New York trading before the stock
market opened. Yet they have been known to intervene to adjust euro/Swiss
franc to better refl ect Swiss franc/euro prices during European trade. The
question for traders must be where is the imbalance in a currency price and in
what market would it be cost effective for central bank intervention? In this
instance, the Swiss will buy francs and sell euros.
Central banks fi nd comfort within certain ranges for their pairs of interest
so a ranging market is acceptable. When pairs trend in an unacceptable direc-
tion for a central bank, caution is advised. Smaller nations are more prone
toward intervention because the sale of their exported goods is paramount to
the health of their economies, especially Australia and New Zealand who export
commodities and Japan who exports manufactured goods. U.S. dollar/Swiss
franc, Australian dollar/U.S. dollar, New Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar, and U.S.
dollar/Japanese yen are the premier pairs to monitor because the United States
is the largest destination for exported goods of these nations.
Canada is the questionable nation because as a commodity nation and
dependent on exports to the United States, they are not prone toward inter-
vention because they rely primarily on oil exports and their present supply
will last for a considerable time in the future. Yet due to its close relationship
with U.S. banks, U.S. markets, and sales to U.S. manufacturers, Canada
can weather any economic storm.

and competitor nations. They readjust their index every three years so the
new chain link from 2004 is properly refl ected. The new link occurred in
2010 with completed 2009 trade data.
Due to the size and complexity of euro zone nations, the ECB formu-
lated and categorized many indices in order of importance to euro zone trade.
The standard 12-nation currency index incorporates major trading partners
of the euro zone. The list and their weights are:
Country Weight
Australia 1.0
United States 19.6
United Kingdom 17.8
Switzerland 6.4
Sweden 4.8
Canada 1.7
Denmark 2.7
Hong Kong 2.0
Japan 8.3
Singapore 1.8
Norway 1.3
South Korea 3.9
The next index, the EER 12, incorporates the 16 nations of the euro zone
against the 12 nations above. Next is the EER 22 (Slovakia drops from 23rd)
that factors the 16 European nations against 22 more trading nations. The
nations of the euro zone do not hold a position in the index since they are
represented by the euro.
This last set of nations includes China with a trade weight of 13.6, Poland
4.8, Hungary 3.1 and the Czech Republic 4.1, Bulgaria, Hungary, Estonia,
Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Croatia, Russia, Turkey, Brazil, Indonesia, India,
Philippines, Mexico, Malaysia, New Zealand, Thailand, South Africa and
Iceland. All nominal indices are calculated against CPI, PPI, and the GDP
defl ater to form real effective exchange rates. Rates are published as reference
rates at 2:15 a.m. Frankfurt time, 8:00 a.m. New York time.
Most representative currencies for the euro is euro/Canadian dollar, euro/
South Korean won, euro/U.S. dollar, euro/British pound, euro/Japanese yen,
euro/Swiss franc, euro/Swedish krona.

United States
The United States holds a unique position in the world due to not only
enormous trade with its trading partners, but the dollar is the foundation
for all world transactions in commodities and other trade. It is the premier
economic barometer so many nations depend on the economic health of the
United States for their own economic welfare.
USDX
As a measure to the world, the United States created a unique situation for its
dollar index. It allowed the dollar index to trade almost as if it were a single
free-fl oated currency. But it is actually a compendium of currencies.
The dollar index trades on the New York Board of Trade, now called the
Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), as DXY. It trades for 22 hours as a futures
and option contract on the Intercontinental Exchange and is quoted as DX.
It also trades on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The polemic with
this scenario is this particular dollar is not today’s offi cial trade-weight dollar
index. The DXY index originated in 1973 and formed along with all other
nations’ TWI as currencies began a free fl oat. This dollar index is what is
offi cially recognized by the world as the price of the dollar in the markets, the
measure against all other currency prices. A need existed then to keep some
semblance of balance for the dollar due to its paramount importance as the
foundation of exchange throughout the world, as all other traded products on
any exchange are quoted in dollars, such as commodities.
The DXY dollar index incorporates six nations’ currencies. Following is a
list of the six nations’ currencies and their weights: euro 57.6, yen 13.6, British
pound 11.9, Canadian dollar 9.1, Swedish krona 4.2, and Swiss franc 3.6.
The euro, yen, British pound, and Canadian dollar comprise about 92 percent
of the index. The six currencies are calculated as a geometric average. Note
the following formula:
50.14348112 (cid:4) euro/U.S. dollar (cid:2) 0. 576 (cid:4) U.S. dollar/Japanese yen
0.136 (cid:4) British pound/U.S. dollar (cid:2) 0.119 (cid:4) U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar
0.091 (cid:4) U.S. dollar/SEK 0.042 (cid:4) U.S. dollar/Swiss franc 0.036
The base period is equal to 100 from 1973. If the dollar is used as the
base, the value is positive. If the dollar is used as the quote, the value is
negative. What is missing from the USDX as opposed to the offi cial U.S.

government dollar index is the Australian dollar. For this reason, the USDX
and the offi cial Major Index have similarities. On a correlation basis against the
U.S. dollar, the euro, British pound, and Australian dollar correlate together in
movements but against the dollar in market movements while the Canadian
dollar, Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and Swedish krona all move together with the
U.S. dollar. The difference between the two indices is that the offi cial Major
Index numbers released today represent one week prior’s results. So informa-
tion collected today and factored are not released until one week later. For this
reason, any trade strategy should involve contemplation between both indices.
U.S. Major and Broad Index
This dollar index is called the Major Index and consists of seven curren-
cies: the euro, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc, British pound, Australia dollar,
Japanese yen, and Swedish krona. The value of the Major dollar Index is
derived by its value of trade weights in the Broader dollar Index that consists
of 26 nations that includes the seven currencies in the Major Index. For the
Major dollar Index, weights are distributed as follows:
Country (Currency) Weight
Euro zone (euro) 17.792
Canada (dollar) 14.701
Japan (yen) 8.265
United Kingdom (pound) 4.133
Switzerland (franc) 1.535
Australia (dollar) 1.280
Sweden (krona) 0.961
Rates are released as mid rates. For the Broader Index, weights are issued
not to include the original seven:

Mexico 9.621
China 17.934
Taiwan 2.459

The Major and Broad Index is factored so it accounts for third-market
competition. So its exports, imports, and a third weight are factored to
capture third-market competition. The Federal Reserve publishes not only
the overall trade weights but import, export, and third weights for each
currency.
• Import weights for the Major Index are as follows: Euro (cid:3) 16.719,
Canada (cid:3) 16.784, Japan (cid:3) 9.046, United Kingdom (cid:3) 3.266, Swiss (cid:3)

4.1163, Canadian dollar 3.6097, and Swedish krona 4.3414. The 2009 to
2010 multiplier was 34.9870792920 (CME Rulebook 2010).
International Monetary Fund: Role and Function in Trade
The IMF was born at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference
at the Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, in 1944. The
IMF was charged with stabilizing exchange rates, securing fi nancial stability,
facilitating international trade, and fostering economic growth. Today, the
IMF claims 186 members, up from 45 in 1944.
After 66 years of existence and many years of growth, the IMF today
fulfi lls the role as the foundation of the world economy due to its many years
as monitor, mentor, and facilitator. This role was accomplished due to the
multitudes of studies the IMF performed over its many years. Its country
studies are by far the most detailed in all aspects of any nation. The research
it performs and the quality of the research that is published periodically is
without question extraordinarily valuable. Yet it is the world role it facilitates
that is most important.
When nations revamped their TWIs, the IMF provided the model and
research. When nations report their TWI numbers every day, trade is moni-
tored and reported to various nations by the IMF through invoices of imports
and exports that cross borders TWIs can be factored. All is accomplished elec-
tronically. When currencies went from a gold fi xed dollar to a free fl oat, the
IMF was instrumental in assisting nations through the transitional periods.
This role comes at a price to nations as they must pay dues, yet without the
IMF the world would be a very different place in its external and systemic
functions and operations because the IMF bails out nations whose fi nances
fall below international standards.
Imagine what the world would be like without the IMF. Thomas Hobbs’
Leviathan would be rectifi ed and life would be nasty, short, and brutish.

Exchange Rates and Trade Weight Indices 69
The IMF’s TWI is the model for the world because it captures third-market
competition. It can monitor effectively the whole world’s trade by the use of
various weights assigned to each nation. What was learned from this early formed
model in the IMF’s history is a concept called exchange rate pass through.
Exchange Rate Pass Through and the U.S. Dollar
Exchange rate pass through says a change in the value of a nation’s currency
induces a change in the price of a nation’s imports and exports, a proven
methodology due to extensive records maintained by the IMF and thanks to
Linda Goldberg whose 2008 paper, “Vehicle Currency Use in International
Trade” I quote and summarize: “Every time a good or service crosses a nation’s
border, customs records the type of product, its value, and the currency used
to import or export. This invoiced information is transmitted to the IMF
who further transmits it to each nation so each nation can factor their TWI.
Currently, the U.S. dollar dominates the choice of currency in trade through-
out South America, Asia, Australia, and Eastern Europe. The euro dominates
the remainder of the world.” For this and other reasons, the U.S. dollar and
euro are two of the most widely traded currencies in the spot market. The
choice of currency to be used in trade however is a matter of a clear and
broad choice. Nations aren’t locked into a particular currency. “They choose
the currency that favors their own exchange rate, one that will enhance their
profi ts. This is why U.S. dollar indices factored today are held for release one
week later. The information is too sensitive for immediate release and can
skew markets.
Indicative versus Reference Rates
When a nation releases its trade weight effective exchange rate every day, this
is called by most of the world an indicative rate. The ECB refers to its trade
weight effective exchange rate as a reference rate. Both are slight semanti-
cal references. What is important is that the major nations factor their TWI
based on a set formula with set weights and a set fi xing time daily and released
at the same time as mid rates. For emerging-market nations such as Brazil, the
story is quite different because emerging-market nations lack a TWI. Instead,
they negotiate currencies based on currency spot auctions. The currency is
negotiated rather than an index price. The best example is found at the Bank
of Mauritius (intnet.mu). Indicative rates, as they are termed, work as follows.



==================================================
                     PAGE 85                      
==================================================

70 Inside the Currency Market
Indicative rates for most of the world’s nations are negotiated through
bankers. An exact time is set every day that opens bid and ask prices for
currencies. This process, called Indicative Rate Surveys, lasts about 20 min-
utes depending on the nation but this time is strictly enforced by those that
administer this service. Normally an FX Committee or a particular nation’s
market committee administers this function. Once the exact time to close
bid and ask occurs, highest and lowest bids are thrown out and the remaining
bids are averaged to derive an indicative rate. This is the rate released at the
fi xing time every day so banks and markets must rebalance their structures
in order to meet these new funding and cost needs based on the negotiated
currency price.
This fi xing-time rate is also called mid rates because fi xing times generally
occur just after market openings in the respective nations. Mid rates refer to
middle rates between wholesale buy and sell quotes.
Banks that bid on currencies have various reasons for their bids and vari-
ous means based on a bid or ask price. A bank may bid due to a trade-fi nance
transaction that awaits, dollar transactions may await, bids may be based
on spot prices or a spot price implied in an offshore nondeliverable forward
foreign-exchange market. Rates are then dealt in the interbank market. If a
spot auction fails in its fi rst attempt, another auction is held until a spot price
is established.
Major companies may use these rates for payments to another nation,
some transfer money, some buy travelers checks, some trade one currency for
another, others denominate bank accounts in various currencies, and others
adjust spot prices. Still others may plan future developments by locking in a
price in a fi nancial instrument. All markets adjust to the fi x. An indicative
rate can be released as an exchange rate or spot price.
Factor Exchange Rates
The formula is base – term or variable/fi xed. For New Zealand dollar/U.S.
dollar spot price, it costs 6830 at this time to buy one U.S. dollar. The reverse
asks how many dollars does it take to buy one New Zealand dollar. The for-
mula is one U.S. dollar divided by 6830 New Zealand dollars for an exchange
rate of 0.000146.
The euro/U.S. dollar spot price traded at 2384 so 1 euro divided by 2384
is equal to 0.00419. It costs .00419 to buy one euro. Euro/New Zealand
dollar trades at 1.7667 so New Zealand dollar to euro is equal to 0.56602
New Zealand dollars to equal one euro. Are exchange rates overvalued or

undervalued? That would depend on prices of products, the cost of busi-
ness at these rates, and how one viewed this question. Europeans may see
2384 euro to one dollar as expensive while an American may view this rate as
cheap. Bloomberg factors PPP over a yearly period to gauge prices between
nations.
Trade Weight Indices and Spot Trades
The foremost reason central banks switched from an arithmetic to a geomet-
ric calculation of TWIs is because they can track percent changes in the TWI
to percent changes in spot-currency pairs without affecting the base period.
Both coincide perfectly. This allows many possibilities to trade spot against
trade weight indices.
In the United States, the St. Louis Federal Reserve, through its Federal
Reserve Economic Data System called FRED, tracks the U.S. Broad Index
based on change, percent changes, and compounded rates of change. FRED
can be factored for any TWI against any currency pair using the same meth-
odology. Charts can be constructed based on TWI to the most interested
pairs to a particular central bank. TWI prices would be listed on the left side
and currency prices across the bottom. Then draw a trend line to monitor
prices. Look at the most interesting pairs in this manner.
The Swiss want U.S. dollar/Swiss franc not to rise and not to turn weak
in price; they want Swiss franc/U.S. dollar to rise. Why? Businesses that earn
profi ts in the United States can more easily repatriate their monies and earn
foreign reserves. Earnings in U.S. dollars means that the Swiss will earn more
in Swiss francs when the funds are transferred and this is an economic good
for Switzerland.
U.S. dollar pairs can be charted against any TWI based on percent
changes. The Bank of England charts its ERI among other methods based on
a probability scale of implied volatilities. British Bankers Association (BBA)
LIBOR and specifi c nation LIBOR can be tracked against any TWI.
Any policy rates can be tracked against any TWI. TWIs can be tracked
against each other and correlated. A TWI is an index and indices can be
tracked against any other index.
View correlation within one nation’s TWI as a one-point move up or
down in the TWI represents an X move in exchange rates. New Zealand once
factored its TWI against 90-day bank bills and the Monetary Conditions
Index. They found an X point move represented a Y move in the TWI. This
indicator is not published anymore.

==================================================

72 Inside the Currency Market
TWIs ebb and fl ow over the years. Current policy rates and TWIs are
currently low, so the abundance of liquidity that sits idle will eventually be
absorbed with higher rates that will send TWIs back up and in turn send
currency pairs back to trend. Think about the BOE’s ERI and the two most
interested pairs, British pound/U.S. dollar and euro/British pound.
A rising ERI can only send the British pound/U.S. dollar long and
euro/British pound short. Yet British pound/euro will go long along with
British pound/U.S. dollar. A rising CERI in Canada will send the Canadian
dollar/U.S. dollar long and U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar short. A rising TWI
in New Zealand sends New Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar and New Zealand
dollar/Japanese yen long. Notice the positive correlation of base pairs. Yet
New Zealand dollar/euro doesn’t correlate with the base pairs, nor does it
properly correlate to a rising New Zealand TWI, so expect much volatility as
this pair settles into acceptable central bank and market ranges. Yet can New
Zealand sacrifi ce New Zealand dollar/euro in exchange for the profi ts of New
Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar and New Zealand dollar/Japanese yen? The same
question applies to Australia. A rising TWI in Australia will send Australian
dollar/U.S. dollar and Australian dollar/Japanese yen long, but what about
Australian dollar/euro and Australian dollar/British pound—that doesn’t
correlate to a rising TWI nor to the two base pairs of Australian dollar/U.S.
dollar and Australian dollar/Japanese yen.
If TWIs are at high levels and economic times turn down, then the
reverse scenarios will hold. Previous longs become shorts. This is just a small
portion of the many possibilities that exist to profi tably trade currency pairs
against any TWI.
Conclusion
Effective exchange-rate indices and effective exchange rates are just another
means to trade spot currencies. The only difference is the index, but a currency
price factored within an index may prove to be a more powerful indicator as
to direction of a particular pair because it is gauged against other currencies in
the index. Each nation has various factors to achieve its desired trade and cur-
rency price goals due to the uniqueness of each nation. Indices are constructed
to refl ect the economic parameters of each nation’s trade circumstances.

CHAPTER 4
Short-Term Interest Rates
and Money Market
Instruments
The purpose of this chapter is not necessarily to know how to trade repurchase
agreements although a full outline is presented. Instead, repurchase agreements
represent the shortest-term interest rate within a nation, the prime mover of a
spot price. These shortest-term interest rates can connect to a currency price
through factors of interest. Factors of interest for repurchase agreements repre-
sent the shortest-term deposit rates and deposit rates represent the bid side of
a currency pair. It determines the cost of money. A bid side rate represents the
fl oor for rates, so it is imperative to understand this market.
Repurchase Agreements
Repurchase agreements comprise two forms, a repo rate and a reverse-repo
rate. The reverse-repo rate can, depending on market conditions, represent an
ask side of a currency, a ceiling. But that is one currency. Each nation must
be understood due to the various factors to achieve its repo rate and the day-
count factors of interest.
Crisis economic conditions forced not only the normally reported and
understood general collateral (GC) rate, but a government rate was estab-
lished as borrowers were forced to borrow from central bank facilities. This
chapter outlines all the various aspects of the repurchase agreement market
from nation to nation. What was once a rate hidden from the market has, in
the last 10 years or so, become a regularly reported rate with updated rates
published periodically throughout any trading day.

74 Inside the Currency Market
What were once popularly known as repos since the inception of central
banks before World War I have now become known as repurchase agree-
ments and reverse-repurchase agreements that serve a vital function of the
daily operation of banking systems throughout the world.
Traditionally, repos were employed as a monetary tool by central banks
to add or subtract liquidity from the banking system as needed to manage
the supply of money that fl owed through banks. This was conducted through
sales or purchases of respective nations’ treasury bonds, notes, and bills. When
central banks bought repos or bonds, they added liquidity, and they drained
liquidity when they reversed the transaction. This occurred t raditionally when
rates were misaligned such as a misaligned Fed funds rate to other short-term
interest rates or, as in days past, when the discount rate was misaligned with
the prime rate to offer a U.S. example. The system was a simple process.
Central banks opened a bidding process to their primary bank dealers
registered with the central bank, currently 19 in the United States, a rate was
agreed upon, and the market acted upon this rate by a sale or purchase.
Repo and reverse-repo rates were reported daily in the fi nancial press.
Typically, both rates were reported along with the spread so any trader could
determine a direction to these shortest of short rates. A repo rate is always
higher than a reverse-repo rate.
Repo markets determine not only the direction of interest rates, but the
yield curve in fi xed-interest markets is also ascertained to serve as a guide to
longer term interest-rate instruments. Repo rates determine prices for swaps,
forwards, and fi xed-income products such as government bonds.
As time progressed and the popularity of repos increased to fi nance
operations, mortgaged-backed securities, stocks, commercial paper, corpo-
rate and municipal bonds, and government securities of all maturities were
offered as collateral in exchange for cash to fi nance an institution’s cash needs
on a daily basis.
Eventually clearing and settlement companies formed due to the automa-
tion of U.S. Treasury Market Auctions in 1993 and automation of Treasury
Open Market Operations in 1994 and increased in size due to the increased
number of transactions handled on a daily basis (New York Federal Reserve
2010). Australia switched to automation with passage of the 1998 Payment
Systems and Settlement Act (RBA 2010). This changed the repo market from
a bilateral transactional system to a match book or tri-party repo system where
orders were matched with secured computer connections by size of transac-
tion, bid/ask, available participants, and rates. These were blind transactions
as neither party was familiar with their match.
The identifi cation of the transaction for a bond in the United States
is done by a CUSIP (Committee on Uniform Identifi cation Procedure)



==================================================

number that is the nine-digit character identifi cation number on every bond
that is registered with the Committee on Uniform Identifi cation Procedure
as part of the CUSIP Service Bureau, which is also involved in clearing and
settling trades in the repo market. Other nations adopted similar identifi ca-
tion c onventions. Those conventions are called ISIN numbers, termed the
international securities identifi cation number.
The Bank of International Settlements (BIS) reports in the December
2008 Quarterly Review by Peter Hordahl and Michael King that $10 trillion
in repos were transacted by the United States and euro zone in 2007 and
$1 trillion in the United Kingdom. The New Zealand Central Bank reports
7,000 daily transactions totaling about $40 billion daily. Yet this fi gure is the
total for swaps, fi xed interest, equities, and repo transactions. The Federal
Reserve’s 19 primary bank dealers reported $570 billion in daily average
trading volume in 2007. Repos became the newest and easiest source of
fi nance for all nations around the world in the last 12 years or so because
of the range of rates various banks and dealers charged based on the particu-
lar transaction and because the market was safe due to the collateralization
of the market.
Prior to the explosion of this market, central banks transacted repos based
on British Bankers Association (BBA) LIBOR. That was only one rate, today
many rates exist that form a viable market for dealers, banks, and broker dealers.
Money was earned by dealers based on the haircut, the fee charged to han-
dle transactions. Haircuts depended on market risk and length of time in the
transaction. Down economic times saw shorter-dated repurchase agreements
with volatile repo rates, a boon for dealers. Crisis economic times saw a higher
demand for liquidity but lenders were skeptical, so haircuts and rates rose.
It is imperative for the currency spot trader to check longer-dated repur-
chase deals and turnover to gauge activity and determine where this market
may be headed. Shorter-dated deals and higher repo rates are a sign of eco-
nomic downturns. Another method is check the spreads between the repur-
chase and the reverse repurchase, as wider spreads are an indicator of down
economic times as the cost to borrow increases. The unforeseen polemic to
this market materialized when economic calamity gripped the world in 2008,
interest rates dropped to near zero for many nations, and stimulus funding
was the order of the day to prop up failing economies and institutions. This
led to failed repo transactions when the price of loaned instruments lost their
value. In repo-market parlance this is called the fail, and fails occur all the
time but more so during crisis situations.
Dealers and banks then turned to lending only the safest and most liquid
securities. The golden system of fi nance for so many banks, central bankers,
and major companies froze and was limited to only the most credit-worthy

customers with only the most liquid of government securities. The cost to
lend with uncertain economic conditions and uncertain interest rates became
too great a risk.
Questions of default became a huge concern for lenders. Central banks
then established special lending facilities to accommodate the shortage of
liquidity. Central banks swapped less-liquid securities for government secu-
rities for a fee that was marked to market daily. Assets that fell below the
threshold loan value were charged a margin fee to bring the asset price back to
market value or the position was sold. The United States established the Term
Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) with 28-day terms to lend. Under the
Federal Reserve Act section 13 (3) the Fed can become the lending author-
ity under emergency conditions. This allowed the Fed to further establish
the temporary Primary Dealer Credit Facility so broker dealers could obtain
loans from the Fed. Other nations followed.
The Bank of England (BOE) established the Special Liquidity Scheme,
the Swiss established the Liquidity Shortage Financing Facility, New Zealand
established the Overnight Reserve Repo Facility, the European Central Bank
(ECB) established the Marginal Lending Facility, and the Japanese estab-
lished the Complement Deposit Facility. All facilities brought the repo and
lending system back to life, however the majority of transactions were con-
ducted for much shorter terms than what was once the norm. What was once
a highly liquid market to fund credit and risk positions with stable repo rates
disintegrated and liquidity dried up, so without central bank intervention,
the banking system around the world was under severe threat.
Many smaller and medium-sized banks failed under this scenario because
either the larger banks refused to lend or smaller and medium-sized banks
didn’t have the necessary collateral and could not meet liquidity needs. The
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) reports approximately 314
banks failed in the United States alone during this period from 2008 to 2010.
Questions of confi dence had to be restored to this market with the prop-
osition that default was not an option, a position only central banks could
perform. Since the crisis originated in the United States, the contagion spread
to other nations’ funding operations since the majority of the world relies on
U.S. dollar funding and direction to meet its own bank liquidity needs.
Insurmountable problems arose when requests for funding through cen-
tral bank facilities had an effect of almost draining the reserves of each central
bank. Central banks then offered special fi nancing instruments with vari-
ous maturities to account for reserves. The Bank of England offered Bank of
England Bills with maturities of one to seven days, the ECB offered Debt
Certifi cates for 12 months or less, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) offered Financing

Bills with six month or less maturities, and the Swiss offered Swiss National
Bank Bills with seven-, 14- and 28-day maturities.
This section will highlight the repurchase agreement and the reverse
repurchase agreement due to its valuable importance to the spot trade and
interest rates, the prime mover of spot prices. This discussion can’t be limited
to the GC market for repos even though the GC rate is the market in which
central banks, dealers, and broker dealers transact their business and because
it is the rate most scrutinized by the trading public because it represents the
private market. The public market through central bank facilities must also
be highlighted.
Instead, the many types of repos will be highlighted due to their value
and implications for other various transactions such as the prediction of
future interest rates. Repo rates vary from nation to nation due to varying
interest rates in each nation and because each nation performs transactions
for the most part in its own currency. The main reason why various repo rates
are different in each nation is different day-count conventions; the United
States uses 360 days, Australia and New Zealand use 365, and Great Britain
uses 365 days as well.
To fund positions, many banks conducted repo operations in other
nations’ markets, while some central banks transacted deals in only U.S.
Government securities. Of the 19 primary bank dealers registered with the
Federal Reserve, HSBC from England, Nomura Securities and Mizuho from
Japan, UBS from Switzerland, and RBS from Scotland conduct repo oper-
ations in the United States. Yet JP Morgan, Nomura Securities, Goldman
Sachs, and Citi Bank are registered to conduct repo operations in Europe,
while Citi Bank also conducts repo operations in New Zealand.
Primary dealers in the United States must comply with Tier-1 and Tier-2
capital requirements outlined by the Basel Capital Accords that seek to stan-
dardize banking across borders. Currently $100 million is required as Tier-1
capital for banks and $50 million for broker dealers. All report weekly trading
activities, cash on hand, futures, and Treasury positions, as well as participa-
tion in Treasury Auctions, a requirement for dealers to maintain their primary
status (U.S. Treasury 2010).
U.S. Treasury Auctions are conducted through the Treasury’s Bureau of
Public Debt and report on dealer participation. The current proposal by the
Fed is to increase the number of primary dealers. The main problem with
repo rates is the reportability of rates and number of transactions.
From the United States’ and most nations’ central banks and settlement
companies, we fi nd one fl at U.S. rate reported in the Wall Street Journal
minus the number of transactions, minus dollar amounts, and minus types of

repo transactions and terms of agreement. One must now search each nation’s
fi nancial press or search each nation’s central bank to determine an individual
nation’s repo rate.
For the United States, a change will occur as the Depository Trust and
Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the major clearer and settlement company
in the United States, will begin to report a GC rate during the day’s trad-
ing as well as an end-of-day rate as part of the increased transparency of this
market recommended by the United States and adopted as policy by other
central banks around the world. The DTCC constructed the DTCC GCF
Repo Index Trade Mark™, to report repo rates. The index is a weighted
average of interest rates paid each day on GCF repurchase agreements based
on U.S. government, federal agency, and mortgaged backed securities. A repo
rate is reported as an end of day rate through the index. Since December
2010, anyone can view a chart on the DTCC site. The index coincides with
the Repurchase Overnight Index Average Index introduced by the London
Wholesale Market Brokers Association April 2010 to gauge overnight secured
funding in sterling.
RONIA is a weighted average rate to four decimal places of all secured
sterling overnight cash transactions transacted between 12:00 midnight and
4:15 a.m. EST, 7:00 a.m., 10:00 a.m. London.
Due to the unforeseen dilemma of frozen markets, many central banks
are currently studying issues of past repo-market failures in order to offer more
transparency so future markets won’t suffer past effects. The European Repo
Council in Europe is one of the most forthright in their openness of rates and
terms of lending. This is because Europe is home to the International Capital
Markets Association (ICMA), which publishes offi cial European repo infor-
mation through the European Repo Council such as number and types of
transactions, maturities, dollar amounts, and each nation’s currency settled in
all transactions. The European Repo Council was established by ICMA when
the euro was introduced, and extensive repo market information has been
published in their biannual report every six months since 2001. Currently the
19th report is slated for publication.
This report is the only true and reliable source to understand the repo
market. The problem is that the reports cover only the European markets. To
understand the direction of this market overall, however, is to determine what
currency repo transactions are settled. More U.S. dollar settlements may hint to
increased down economic times ahead as confi dence wanes in the home nation’s
currency. For other nations, one must consult each nation’s central bank web
site, Thomson Reuters, and Bloomberg market information. For Great Britain,
the Wholesale Markets Brokers Association is the expert in all sterling markets.

Repo-Market Defi nition
The repo market involves a trade between a purchaser of a security and a seller
of a security. The buyer offers cash to the seller and the seller offers securities
as collateral. The two parties then agree to reverse the trade at an agreed-
upon day at an agreed-upon rate. This is a contract trade. This transaction
involves a spot sale for the security and forward contract on the repurchase
date to lock in the agreed rate. Rates depend on the type of repo market,
type of repo transaction, length of time for the trade, and whether the trade
involved a third-party clearing agent or a bilateral deal. Tri-party repos are
handled by a settlement company that manages trades for a fee.
The various legs of repo trades offer dealers a chance to profi t on each leg
of the transaction by charging a fee, a haircut, to perform the deal. Ownership
transfers to the buyer in case of a default. Many utilize this market because
loan rates or repo rates are always lower than unsecured borrowed Fed funds
or LIBOR and the transactions are more secure due to collateralization.
The real purpose to borrow and lend in the repo market is to borrow
at sub LIBOR rather than the high cost of the Fed funds market when we
consider the U.S. example. Yet this example holds for all other nations. Repo
rates however tend to track Fed funds and LIBOR in the United States. This
example as well holds for other major trading nations including Call rates and
TIBOR in Japan. All factor into a viable trading environment for the spot
currency trade most importantly because it establishes a fl oor for rates.
In the United States, a high LIBOR, high Fed funds rate, and high repo
rate will drive the dollar down because funding costs are elevated. Conversely,
the euro/U.S. dollar, British pound/U.S. dollar, Australian dollar/U.S.
dollar, and New Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar will rise and head toward weak-
ness, while the U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc, and U.S.
dollar/Japanese yen heads down toward strength.
Repo Rates and Repo Interest
A repo rate is an annualized rate based on a 360-day year in the United States.
This convention is common in European repo markets. To factor, a U.S. repo
rate is equal to dollar interest divided by the Principal × 360 divided by the
repo term in days. Repo rates are calculated and reported throughout the day
in a few nations.
The Swiss report their repo rate every three minutes. Interest is factored as
the difference between the sale and purchase price or the difference between

the forward and the spot price. The settlement date of the forward equals the
maturity date of the loan. To factor interest is equal to the repo rate multi-
plied by the price on purchase date multiplied by the days divided by 360
[(Purchase date divided by the sale date) divided by 360]. Accrued interest
began in the 1980s as the number of debt issues increased. Cash loaned and
value of collateral is equal to the haircut or margin.
Types of Repo Transactions and Spot-Currency Trades
Many types of repo transactions exist around the world that all have huge
implications for the spot-currency trade. For example, Europe and Great
Britain traditionally traded a fl oating-rate repo where the repo rate and matu-
rity of the repo were left open. A rise in these transactions usually signals an
interest-rate change, usually an anticipation of a rate hike. This was an easy
trade for spot-currency traders as a rise in fl oating-rate repos was the fi rst sign
that central-bank borrowing costs were too low and a rate hike was immi-
nent. Once the hike was announced, traders settled their repo and currency
transactions with a profi t. Currency traders could act accordingly based on
fl oating-rate repurchase agreements, but these transactions are phasing out in
nations.
Currently, Great Britain just announced a 6-to-12 month phase-out of
the fl oating-rate repo in their U.S. dollar repo market. It is being replaced
with an unlimited fi xed-rate term.
Europe has adopted the same policy, but Europe’s repo rate will be
indexed to their euro Overnight Index Average (EONIA). It is the overnight
rate for the euro and a weighted average of all overnight unsecured lending
in the interbank market. This ties repo rates to inside nation LIBOR. This
is interesting because the popularity of early repo lending was based on sub
LIBOR rates.
The United States terms fl oating rate repos Open Purchases where the
repurchase rate and maturity is left open. Once this trade is settled, it must
be re-rated and factored to its maturity date. It is questionable how long this
type of transaction will continue to exist.
Japan employs a Spot/Next, Tom/Next, then an overnight repo. The
vast majority of repo transactions are fi xed term, 88.9 percent according to
the December 2009 European Repo Council Report, but predominately the
same in major nations’ markets.
Forward-start repos refl ect interest-rate positioning and are employed in
Europe. Suppose an interest-rate announcement is imminent, forward-start

==================================================

Short-Term Interest Rates and Money Market Instruments 81
repos position the announcement to a higher priced repo rate and represent a
profi t. A higher prime rate rebalances shorter-term rates higher.
Buy/sell-back repos in Europe are a spot purchase and a forward sell that
is not tied to the deal based on the repo rate. The commonalities of repo
markets vary slightly from central bank to central bank. All employ the GC
market, all report the rate in the GC market, and all prefer to deploy gov-
ernment securities strictly in down economies. As lending increases, dealers
accept other types of collateral.
U.S. Repo Market
The U.S. repo market began in 1918 when the central bank sold Bankers
Acceptance Certifi cates to the private market only to buy them back at a later
date (Treasury 2010). Bankers Acceptances are timed drafts sold at a discount
in the money market and represent one of the oldest money market instru-
ments. The Federal Reserve conducts Open Market operations through the
New York Fed by its System Open Market Operations but reports through
the SOMA account, termed the System Open Market Account. The Fed uses
this account to manage currency in circulation, manage reserves, and provide
liquidity in emergency situations. This is conducted through trade of the Fed
Funds Rate.
The Monetary Control Act of 1980 allowed the Fed to exchange
maturities in open-market operations as needed. As of July 7, 2010, the
SOMA account measured in thousands, held T-Bills 18, 422, 636.7,
Treasury Notes and Bonds 712, 023, 185.2, Treasury Infl ation Protected
Securities 41,125, 445.7, Fed Agency securities 164,762, 000.0 and settled
mortgaged backed securities 1,118, 290, 404.9. The account holds a total
of 2,054, 623, 672.5 with a weekly change of 163, 506.3. The Federal
Reserve Bank of New York reports weekly changes to the SOMA account
on its web site, newyorkfed.org. The second SOMA account is used for
foreign currency investments denominated in euros and yen. The account
is measured at par value daily.
The most important repo market in the United States is the General
Collateral market that begins at about 7:30 a.m. New York time and ends
at 3:30 p.m. with the close of Fedwire Securities Service. 7:30 is the start
because that time occurs after the BBA releases their LIBOR for the United
States and U.S. banks end their auction rate of U.S. LIBOR, a perfect
methodology to determine the day’s repo rate because repo rates will always
be below LIBOR. This allows dealers who are among the 19 big banks that

82 Inside the Currency Market
are registered by master agreements with the Federal Reserve to begin the
15-minute auction process that includes bids and offers for money to inter-
dealer brokers.
Master agreements in the United States are called BMA agreements and
began in the late 1980s for ability to trade in government securities. After the
bidding process ends with the New York Federal Reserve Bank who manages
the Fed’s Open Market Operations, highest and lowest rates are discarded and
remaining bids are averaged to form the day’s traded repo rate.
The GC market expanded with the rise of clearing and settlement
companies and the sophistication of computers that allow bids and offers
to be viewed by registered banks and broker dealers, termed a Tri-party
repo due to the third leg of the transaction. Today, it is the largest market
because transaction costs were reduced and liquidity enhanced by netting
both legs of the settlement process. Thanks to passage of HR5585, the
Financial Netting Improvement Act in 2006, the GC market was renamed
the General Collateral Finance (GCF) market and expanded beyond
comprehension.
The law allowed banks to reduce their systemic risks by netting, a net
valuation versus a gross valuation so markets won’t be disrupted. This law
applied to repos as well as swap transactions. The Fixed Income Clearing
Corporation, an arm of the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, nets
all lended and borrowed transactions at 3:45 p.m. daily.
Dealers trade these markets all day through the Fixed Income Clearing
Corporation based on principal amount of trade, term, rate, and class of
acceptable securities. These dealers many times make markets in securities.
This is why many trades are negotiated in the GCF market because lending
terms and haircuts apply differently to each trade. Haircuts apply on a trea-
sury bond at one rate while a mortgage-backed security may be negotiated
at another rate. A cash borrower can only seek the best price on borrowed
funds.
Trades are settled based on a delivery-versus-payment basis or a Tri-party
net. Typically established accounts are credited and settled by a book entry.
Banks that clear trades include JP Morgan and Bank of New York Mellon.
Before getting into the details and comments of the white paper released by
the New York Federal Reserve Bank May 17, 2010, that addresses proposed
changes and past problems to the repo market, I borrow two examples from
the report of a repo trade, a Bilateral and Tri-party trade. These trades are per-
formed in simple dollar terms for example purposes yet imagine these trades
performed on $20 million, $30 million, or $100 million, a common daily
occurrence in the repo market.

Bilateral Repo Trade
$100 Repo at 1 Percent Repo Rate and 2 Percent Haircut for 30 Days
The borrower sells $102 of securities to the cash lender and receives $100
in cash.
After 30 days, the borrower pays $100 plus 0.083 in interest to the cash
lender to repurchase securities. This deal is arranged through a clearer. Step
one is negotiation while step two informs the clearer of the trade so accounts
can be credited and debited and transfers of cash and securities can occur.
To factor,
$100 (cid:5) (100 (cid:4) 1 percent (cid:4) (30/360))
this accounts for the Tri-party aspect.
At 8:30 the next morning, repo trades are unwound by the clearer bank
to provide intraday credit to the borrower. The lender’s account has $100
cash, the cash borrower has $102 in securities, no cash, and 3 percent clear-
ing bank margin. So allowable intraday credit is equal to the cash borrower
total collateral plus cash borrower total cash balance less the clearing margin.
$102 (cid:5) 0 (cid:2) ($102 (cid:4) 3 percent) (cid:3) $98.94
End of day repos are again rewound and both accounts are locked based
on cash and securities of this trade.
When the term of this trade is complete, the clearer bank returns cash
plus interest to the cash lender and securities to the borrower. To calculate:
$100 (cid:5) Repo rate (1 percent for 30 days)
$100 (cid:5) (100 (cid:4) 1 percent (cid:4) (30/360)) (cid:3) $100.83
Tri-Party Repo Infrastructure Reform and White Paper
by New York Federal Reserve Bank
Released May 17, 2010, this report derived from a culmination of meetings
with repo-market practitioners, regulators, academics, banks, broker dealers,
money market participants, mutual funds, borrowers, and lenders. The pur-
pose was to address the deterioration of the repo market during the crisis to
assess problems and recommend changes.

84 Inside the Currency Market
This report is historic because the public is given an extraordinary and
insightful view of a repo market that has been essentially closed to public view-
ing due to its closed nature and because it is a market not well understood
operationally by the public due to its many nuances. The number of academic
articles and books on the topic is not overly abundant due to lack of under-
standing and the many details needed to understand this market’s framework.
Michael Fleming and Kenneth Garbade, two economists of the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York, gave a solid devotion to the U.S. repo market in their many
articles, but few others have followed. This report will open the door to further
research. I quote directly and summarize from this report point by point.
The fi rst issue is the conundrum of intraday credit that is explained in
step 3 of my example. This credit is made available to cash borrowers by clear-
ing banks that provide the necessary operational infrastructure to this market.
“Clearing banks clear and settle trades, so the unwinding of trades leaves a
clearing bank exposed to default as lines of credit must be extended, an unlikely
scenario yet an exposure nonetheless.” The purpose of the unwind is to give
collateral to dealers for daily settlement. “The elimination of unwinding of
trades would reduce intraday credit by clearing banks 10 percent, $2.5 trillion
less risk at the May 2008 peak of this market when $2.8 trillion of securities
were fi nanced.” Credit and liquidity risk would shift to cash investors.
Instead of intraday credit, it is recommended to allow automatic substi-
tutions by automation of collateralized securities that support the Tri-party
repo while the transaction remains in place. This was proposed for February
2011 if computer operations can support this function and occurred as a
standardized system. Collateral substitution has always been a factor of this
market that was previously left to the market to decide. As long as a substitu-
tion met the acceptable securities list, a substitution was acceptable practice.
The second issue addresses risk-management practices of cash lenders
and clearing banks that are subject to procyclical pressures. The term procy-
clical pressure derives from a 2009 BIS paper titled “The Role of Valuation
and Leverage in Procyclicality” published by the Committee on the Global
Financial System, a 31-member committee traditionally chaired by the
Chairman of the Federal Reserve. Procyclical pressures can be defi ned as mar-
ket practices such as collateral and margin subject to the credit cycle. Further,
it is a measure of leverage and risk. For example, when long-term assets are
funded by short-term liabilities, a maturity mismatch known as basis risk on
dealer’s banks can occur or when exposure to risky assets exceeds equity capi-
tal. The report outlines leverage in terms of mismatches, degrees of leverage,
and the durability of secured fi nancing.
Cash lenders are money market mutual funds among others that make
investments while cash borrowers are fi xed-income-securities broker deal-
ers who use the repo market for short-term funding because they don’t have

Short-Term Interest Rates and Money Market Instruments 85
access to the Fed discount window (frbdiscountwindow.org). They must rely
on clearing banks to fund short positions, fi nance customer orders, and cover
hedge exposures such as derivative hedges.
“In the fi rst quarter of 2010, securities fi nanced in the repo market
totaled $1.7 trillion, down from the peak of $2.8 trillion in May 2008”. Yet
this peak saw a majority of overnight deals completed rather than longer-
dated term deals, a prediction of a market turn?” From 2004 to 2007, repo
markets doubled but term repos fell while 2006 to 2007 saw growth come
from overnight deals. In May 2002, $750 billion was fi nanced and a straight
trend line existed to the May peak. Since then, the market trended down
and appears to be presently stabilized. “The top-10 cash borrowers account
for 85 percent of market value of Tri-party repo securities fi nanced. The top
10 cash investors provide 65 percent of funds invested. The largest borrowers
fi nance more than $100 billion in securities, the peak saw $400 billion. Cash
investors provide $100 billion in fi nance daily.”
“In the fi rst quarter of 2010, 77 percent of Tri-party deals were fi nanced
by Treasury securities that included 27 percent treasuries, 37 percent agency
mortgage-backed securities, and 13 percent fi xed-income securities.”
Agency securities are defi ned as Fannie Mae, Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation, and Ginnie Mae. “This quarter saw corporate and municipal
securities slowly return.” The repo market deteriorated because these secu-
rities” values were uncertain.
What really forced a deterioration of this market was the collapse of
Countrywide, Bear Stearns, and most prominently Lehman Brothers. Lehman
Brothers had $50 million of U.S. debt in repurchase agreements. Through
Repo 105 accounting standards, Lehman Brothers treated these transactions
as sales rather than fi nance loans that masked their leverage ratios. This caused
a change to their balance sheets. Lehman collapsed, the market deteriorated,
and a review of Repo 105 transactions was under way, fi rst by the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) and U.S. central bank, and then by all
central banks to ensure perpetuity of the repo market.
No anticipation of higher margins was expected. Margins are defi ned as
cash loaned, and value of collateral is equal to the margin or haircut. Stated
differently, a haircut occurs when the cash is lower than the collateral value
of securities. Yet it was recommended that stress tests be performed on col-
lateral price movements to understand margin capacity and market risks. Any
margin increases should be based on asset classes to add market stability. “The
question remains how should collateral valuations be valued, based on yester-
day’s closing prices, today’s closing prices, trading ranges of prices, or volatil-
ity?” Margin payouts were $1,710.5 billion as of April 9, 2010.
Questions of margin as risk based have not been addressed in prior papers
until another BIS paper titled “Role of Margin Requirements and Haircuts in

Procyclicality” was released in March 2010 by the Committee on the Global
Financial System. This paper reports that erosion of margin with increased
trading activity contributed to the growth in leverage possibility due to com-
petition for business. Further, “high credit ratings, ample liquidity, and low
volatility increased borrowers’ comfort level.” This led to more margin calls
as the market began its deterioration due to uncertain value of assets. This
polemic was worldwide rather than a specifi c U.S. example.
Currently, the Basel 2 Accords world framework for haircuts says hair-
cuts are established for each transaction secured by collateral. The Japanese
employ this model in their repo market by a list of margins based on classes of
accepted collateral. The Basel 2 model employed is the Value-at-Risk (VAR)
versus Historic-Volatility framework; “framework periods depend on assets
and length of time in the transaction. VAR haircuts estimate risk at a 95
to 99 percent confi dence level over a 10-day liquidation period. A trade is
factored by the holding period with a 10-day haircut multiplied by the square
root of 0.5.” To borrow an example, a haircut for a fi ve-day holding period
will employ the 10-day liquidation rate multiplied by the square root of 0.5,
a ratio of 5 divided by 10. The U.S. Federal Reserve employs this model for
borrowers at their discount window but progresses a step further by clas-
sifying loans as minimal-risk versus normal-risk loans. Minimal-risk loans
are classifi ed as similar to investment-grade bonds, while normal risk is clas-
sifi ed as below-investment-grade bonds. The purpose is to further evaluate
loans for margins with faster process times. For this purpose, the DTCC is
scheduled to expand its cutoff times later than its present 3:00 p.m. close to
facilitate transactions, which is scheduled for late 2010 or early 2011. The
current proposal is still being addressed. Currently, haircuts are under further
review by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to determine the
acceptable level of margin. Margin changes in the future are an obvious pos-
sibility. Any increase in margin requirements or the elimination of a class of
security can potentially hamper this market and restrict access to credit that
means huge implications for the spot trade. A restriction of credit can only
be U.S. dollar, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, or U.S. dollar/Swiss franc negative
and euro/U.S. dollar, British pound/U.S. dollar, Australian dollar/U.S.
dollar, or New Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar positive. The Federal Reserve is
currently fl oating proposals to increase the number of primary dealers.
Liquidation. Recommendations included a collateral-liquidation service.
Before the market collapsed, prior recommendations included the formation
of a bank to handle liquidations and fi re sales in case of defaults. This recom-
mendation lends more credence in this report and may soon become a reality.
For mature repo trades, a standard time settlement system was recom-
mended to be implemented in late 2010 and point-of-trade confi rmations

that would legally bind the parties were also recommended. These proposals
are currently operational.
Transparency. A recommendation was issued to publish key market
information by clearing banks. Information includes market size, depth and
volume, dealer concentration, asset categories, and margin and haircut levels.
This point is profoundly important as well as historic because it will inform
other markets, particularly the currency markets. No mention of rates. Yet
the DTCC proposes to publish a GC rate in September 2010 which has been
completed by their index.
These remaining proposals await to be addressed and formally adopted
by the DTCC. What this market will look like in the future is undetermined,
yet its implications are huge so market professionals may want to monitor
this situation for further developments.
Treasury Market Practices Group and U.S. Fails Charges
In a further effort to review the problems of the repo market and ensure mar-
ket effi ciency, a group of market professionals that comprise the Treasury
Market Practices Group (TMPG) recommended in 2008 a voluntary fails
charge for buyers and sellers that fail to deliver securities based on the con-
tract date, better known as Delivery versus Payment. Since May 2009, thanks
to submittal of Rule 2009-03 by the FICC, clearer and governed by the
1934 Securities and Exchange Act, and approval by the SEC, this rule has
been formalized as a standard market practice in the repo, options, and
forwards markets. The question of fails has been considerable. Consider
par value of fails reached its highest levels in December 2009 with $676
million in fails and $624 million in January 2010. August 2009 saw $572
million, September 2009 $312 million, and October 2009 $260 million.
July 2010 saw $468 million and May 2010 $280 million. A fails charge
also allows a reasonable interest charge subject to agreement by contract-
ing parties.

88 Inside the Currency Market
Japanese Repo Market
Traditional Japanese repo markets were quite different from their Western
counterparts because the Japanese viewed their repo markets more as a lend-
ing market rather than a buy-and-sell arrangement. The Japanese borrow and
lend but not through an outright purchase and sale. The modern-day repo
began with the General Repo and Special Collateral market. The General
repo market was a source for banks to raise funds and served as the link to the
money and interbank markets (Baba, Inamura, 2002).
The Special Collateral market was the link for dealers, called Tanshi
companies, to the securities markets such as the all-important Japanese
Government Bond (JGB). Traders and banks lend cash and bonds and then
cash in at the repo rate. The Japanese term this the gensaki market to refl ect
a special fi nancing method that employs securities and funds exchanged
for a fi xed period. The market exploded from $18 trillion yen in 1996 to
$42 trillion by 2001 (Baba, Inamura). The polemic arose due to contract
settlement after the contract date and repo rates hovered above Japanese Call
and EUROYEN rates so the modern-day GC market was born in 2002 to
refl ect a better-managed risk system.
Today’s Tokyo repo rate is a refl ection of Japan’s GC market, a market
rate based on a mid rate of bids and offers from an average of 20 banks.
Currently 15 to 20 active banks in the market with good credit standing
bid at least the mandated $10 billion yen transaction, a standard for any
maturities. If half the institutions fail to bid, no rate is issued. The Bank
of Japan conducts and manages the bidding process for each maturity
promptly at 11:00 a.m. Tokyo time and ends at 11:45 a.m. Quick Corp
then calculates the rate by eliminating the highest and lowest 15 percent and
averages the remaining bids to three decimal places. The BOJ then promptly
reports the Tokyo Repo Rate at 12:30 p.m. on their web site and the bidding
institutions report the repo rate on their own web sites shortly thereafter
(Japanese Bankers Association 2010).
Bidders termed counter parties bid on yields to purchase or sell the
majority and most important asset of Japan and the repo market, the JGB. A
purchase or sale price is calculated by dividing the market price by the margin
ratios. A resell is calculated by the amount obtained by multiplying the pur-
chase price by purchasing yields to purchase price. A repurchase is factored
by amount obtained by multiplying the selling price by selling yields to sell
price. Rates are on a 365-day basis.
Overnight rates are settled based on a T(cid:5)0 and T(cid:5)1, spot/next known
as day-after-tomorrow trades and settled T(cid:5)2, and one week or longer trades
are settled on a T(cid:5)3 basis (Tokyo Stock Exchange). Current 2010 BOJ policy

is to settle repo transactions on a T(cid:5)1 basis to eliminate fails. Many changes
occurred in the last three years in Japan’s repo market that required revisions
to the Japan Banking Act (BOJ 2010).
At the October 2008 Bank of Japan policy meeting, the bank introduced
a Floating Rate JGB, an infl ation-indexed bond, broadened the range of
acceptable asset-backed commercial paper, and issued a 30-year JGB. All are
subject to margin ratios set by the BOJ annually (BOJ Offi cial Reports 2009).
Current 2010/2011 margin ratios for Japan’s repo market to sell are as fol-
lows: up to 1 year maturities—0.998, more than 1 year and up to 5 years—
0.998, more than 5 years, up to 10 years—0.998, more than 10 years and
up to 20 years—0.998, 20 to 30 years—0.998. For Floating Rate Bonds up
to 1 year—0.992, one to fi ve years—0.998, 5 to 10 years—0.981, and 10 to
20 years—0.981. For Infl ation Indexed Bonds, up to 1 year—0.964, one to fi ve
years—0.998, 5 to 10 years—0.981, and 10 to 20 years—0.981. For Infl ation
Indexed Bonds up to 1 year—0.964, one to fi ve years—0.960, 5 to 10 years—
0.981, and 10 to 20 years—0.981,. For Infl ation Indexed Bonds up to 1 year—
0.964, one to fi ve years—0.960, 5 to 10 years—0.954, 10 to 20 years—0.948,
20 to 30 years—0.940 and more than 30 years—0.940. (BOJ web site)
Following is a list of rates for 2010/2011 securities purchased by the
BOJ: For JGB’s with a residual maturity of up to 1 year maturity—1.003, one
to fi ve years—1.007, 5 to 10 years—1.007, 10 to 20 years—1.007, 20 to 30
years—1.007, and more than 30 years—1.029.
Floating Rate Bonds with maturity up to 1 year 1.009, 1 to 5 years
1.013, 5 to 10 years 1.020, 10 to 20 years 1.020. Infl ation Indexed Bonds up
to 1 year 1.039, 1 to 5 years 1.043, 10 to 20 1.058, 20–30 years 1.068 and
more than 30 years 1.068.
Infl ation Indexed Bonds up to 1 year maturity 1.039, 1–5 years 1.043,
5–10 1.051, 10–20 1.058, 20–30 1.068 and 30+ 1.068.
Daily volume in the repo market is $53 trillion yen, $39.9 trillion in the
Call market, $42.3 trillion in JGB’s settled as delivery versus payment, and
$11.9 in yen foreign-exchange transactions. Intraday overdrafts are measured
every 10 minutes and account for $38.6 trillion.
While trades in the U.S. closely track U.S. LIBOR, Japanese repo rates closely
track Yields on U.S. Treasury Bills. The formula to trade Japanese yen/U.S.
dollar is found within this framework. For all of 2010 margin ratios,
Japanese repo rates stabilized between 0.10 and 0.15, yet the top policy
Call rate for Japan is 0.10. Ultimately, the price to borrow must always be
below the top rates.
Consistent with the U.S. TMPG, the Japanese Securities Dealers
Association formed the Working Group concerning the “Review of Fails
Practice for Bond Trading.” This ongoing discussion involves the question

whether fails charges should be a penalty charge or a simple rate charge.
The release of this report is scheduled for late 2010. Current 2010 fails in the
Japanese repo market includes 89 fails in April 2010 with a yen face value
of 100 million yen that totaled 3406, May 2010 saw 69 fails totaling 1,673,
and June 2010 saw 53 fails totaling 694 (BOJ Offi cial Reports 2010). The
Japanese decided to apply fails as a market practice rather than a rule equaled
to about three percent of the transaction.
Japanese banks are subject to higher margin rates in March 2011 based
on a recently released report by the Basel Committee.
Spot Currency and Japanese Repo Rates
Japan’s futures market, the Tokyo Futures Exchange, trades a Spot/Next repo
rate future whose index is quoted as 100 minus the average GC spot/next
repo rate, or better stated as 100 minus the rate of interest. This contract is
cash settled. Many employ these contracts to hedge spot against futures or
futures against cash markets while others speculate on interest-rate changes
by the BOJ (Tokyo Stock Exchange 2010).
No better method exists in Japan to determine interest-rate direction
than this fi nancial instrument due to its short-term nature. A rise in rates
usually signals a BOJ policy rate increase while a lower rate signals a fall in
policy rates. The perfect time to monitor this rate is before a BOJ meeting.
A rate increase or decrease will send the U.S. dollar/Japanese yen skyrocketing
up or down in a matter of minutes and represents signifi cant profi ts for traders.
The implication for this trade is to factor an implied repo trade. An implied repo
trade is to short one market and go long in another so one position is hedged.
In this instance, suppose one is long the futures contract and short the
cash repo market or vice versa. Profi ts from the long will cover the short with
a profi t, provided that the security can be delivered for a profi t on settlement
date. The instrument with the highest implied repo rate would be the cheapest
to deliver upon settlement. A formula must account for the price paid/purchase
price of bond or whatever instrument (cid:4) Day count convention, 365 for
Japan/days to delivery (Tokyo Stock Exchange 2010).
New Zealand
New Zealand’s central bank targets infl ation and prices as their market
methodology. The only method to manage an infl ation target is through
the Consumer Price Index to ensure prices are aligned with infl ation. Bank

reserves must then be further managed so targets are properly aligned and this
is done through repo markets.
The Offi cial Cash Rate (OCR) is the top benchmark interest rate in New
Zealand. New Zealand’s repo market began in 1994. Since 1990, market
trades had cleared through Austraclear but the June 2010 introduction of
NZ Clear means that New Zealand now conducts repo operations. NZ Clear
serves as a real-time settlement system while New Zealand’s central bank, the
Royal Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) owns and manages the New Zealand
Central Securities Depository Limited who becomes the legal owner of secu-
rities during transactions.
NZ Clear settles trades on a delivery-versus-payment basis and trades in
certifi cates of deposit, New Zealand Bank Bills, Bonds, notes, and equities,
and are irrevocable once reported on the system. Austraclear once reported
approximately 800 to 1200 daily trades totaling about NZ $6 billion, but
New Zealand’s repo markets in all of 2010 saw about an average of $3 billion
daily volume with a vast majority fi xed-interest trades (New Zealand Financial
Markets Association). Reason for this is the RBNZ conducted more FX
swaps for funding, but as that market became illiquid during the crisis, repo
transactions became the dominant funding mechanism. So funding occurred
between the two markets as funding in markets permitted.
During the fi nancial crisis, the RBNZ offered an Overnight Term Reverse
Repo Facility to conduct repo operations for overnight and one-week trades
only. The cost is New Zealand’s OCR plus 50 basis points, but ironically this
facility has not been used often.
The RBNZ also offers a Bond Lending Facility where government securi-
ties are lent at OCR minus 150 basis points and repurchased at the OCR rate.
Bids begin with $1 million, and maturities and terms last from overnight to
one week. Bids must state yields factored two decimal places. RBNZ Open
Market Operations begin at 9:30 a.m. New Zealand time.
European Repo Council
Richard Comotto, a noted repo author, scholar, and repo expert has written
the International Capital Markets Association-sponsored biannual European
Repo Market Survey since its 2001 inception. The 40-year goal of ICMA
as a self-regulatory body is to bring effi ciency to the capital markets and the
European Repo Market Survey is just one of those goals.
A few noted points from the survey to gauge conditions for future eco-
nomic activity to highlight future spot trades will be addressed. Fifty-eight

offi ces from 53 fi nancial groups reported for the March 2010 survey. This is an
imperative as an indicator because it represents 14 European nations, Japanese,
and North American banks that conduct repo market business in Europe.
The value of outstanding contracts as of the December 2009 cutoff of
the survey was valued at euro 5,582 billion, down from the 6,775 peak in
2007, but still above the December 2008 euro 4,633 billion and euro 4,868
in June 2009. Forward-start repos refl ect interest-rate positioning and aren’t
widely traded. Yet forward-start repos increased from 6.1 percent to 11.2 percent
to refl ect future interest-rate activity, a prediction of a future downturn. British
pound sterling repos fell from 15.3 percent to 12.3 percent as well as use of
U.K. collateral, 16.1 percent to 12.4 percent, another future prediction of a
downturn. More dramatic is currency composition of repo deals.
The British pound in December 2008 saw a 13.0 composition, 15.3 in
June 2009, and 12.3 in December 2009, a clear indication of either a highly
oversold British pound or an economy falling into an abyss as credit disinte-
grated. Yet the most widely traded euro currency composition fell from 70.6
in December 2008 to 64.2 in June 2009, and recovered to 65.6 in December
2009. The safe-haven status of the U.S. dollar covered the gaps as 9.6 percent
of U.S. dollar-comprised repo deals in December 2008, 14.2 percent in June
2009, and 15.9 percent in December 2009.
Implications of Survey and Spot Currency
The European Repo Market Survey is a true picture of economic activity
because it relates to private banks and markets and because repo rates and
lending activity, due to the safety of this market, are a clear sign to determine
future economic activity. Higher repo rates and reduced lending activity can
only lead to a decrease in the amount of government bonds brought to mar-
ket by central banks, which restricts their own ability to fi nance their own
operations. It is a downward spiral that leads to periods of defl ation where
piles of cash stand idle, markets turn down, shorter term fi nance rates such as
LIBOR and Eurodollars in Europe rise, and the value of currencies fall.
Switzerland
Monetary policy conducted by the central bank of Switzerland termed
the Swiss National Bank (SNB) is based on a target to ensure prices align
with infl ation. The target for the Swiss is the three-month Swiss franc

Short-Term Interest Rates and Money Market Instruments 93
LIBOR called SARON, the Swiss Average Overnight Rate. The current rate
is 0.12 and the target range is 0.00 to 0.75. SARON is fi xed daily at 12:00
noon and calculated by SIX Swiss Exchange, Switzerland’s stock market (SIX
Swiss Exchange 2010).
To manage the infl ation target in the repo market, the Swiss employ the
Swiss Average Rate, the Swiss Current Rate, and the Swiss Average Index.
The Swiss Average Rate is volume weighted and calculated and reported every
10 minutes by SIX Swiss Exchange (SIX Swiss Exchange 2010). Fixing times
occur at noon, 4:00 p.m., and 6:00 p.m. Swiss time.
The Swiss Current Rate is calculated and reported every three minutes
and is based on quotes that appear on the Eurex repo platform and further
reported on Eurex Zurich. This is the most important rate due to its market
sensitivity and because it creates a fl oor of rates for Swiss franc/U.S. dollar.
The Swiss Average Index Overnight is based on daily yields of SARON.
Repo trades are generated through the Eurex Repo platform for the Swiss
General Collateral and Special Repo market, payments and confi rmations
reported and handled by SIX SIS, properly termed SegaInterSettle, and settled
through SIX Interbank Clearing (Eurex Repo 2010).
Both the SNB and Swiss banks perform repos and interbank lending
through this system. The SNB conducts daily one-week repo auctions as a
function of its open market operations that begin at 9:00 a.m. Zurich time
daily with a prior 10-minute bidding process. Through Eurex Repo, the SNB
also conducts GC repos with collateral denominated in U.S. dollars, euros,
British pounds, Danish Kroner, and Norweigan Kroner. The majority of
these transactions are Swiss franc, euro, British pound, and U.S. dollar (Eurex
Repo 2010). Kraennzlin and Schlegel report in a 2009 paper titled “Bidding
Behavior in the SNB’s Repo Auctions” that 35 percent of SNB Swiss franc
repo transactions are passed through Eurex Repo and 65 percent are handled
by the interbank market. Market operations begin at 7:00 a.m. and end at
6:00 p.m. Swiss time.
During the crisis, the SNB established the Liquidity Shortage Facility
but borrowers needed 110 percent of collateral plus payment 200 basis points
above the prior day’s overnight repo index. The overnight repo index has been
replaced by the Swiss Average Index.
Swiss Repo and Spot Currency
Open-market operations are vitally important for any central bank because
transactions determine not only funding costs but market size and liquidity

levels. Success or failure of open-market operations connotes an economic
expansion or contraction, up or down markets both long and short term that
cover a wide range of fi nancial instruments. The Swiss issue their fi nal repo
rate at the 6:00 p.m. close. This is the rate that will determine how the Swiss
markets and the Swiss franc will react on their next day trading day, yet it sets
a price for other overnight markets. It is the rate that sets the standard for
swaps, forwards, fi xed-rate instruments such as bond prices, yields, and yield
curves. Yet the current rate will determine direction throughout the day as
that rate is calculated every three minutes. Because Swiss repo markets allow
for overnight, tom/next, Spot /next, and one week to 12 months out on the
curve, Swiss francs will act in conjunction with these rates. Higher rates in
the repo market will send the Swiss franc down as funding costs increase and
up when rates fall as funding costs decrease. U.S. dollar/Swiss franc and Swiss
franc/U.S. dollar must then be evaluated.
Eurex Zurich Clearing
Consistent with changes to major nation’s repo markets, Eurex Zurich is the
fi rst exchange worldwide to institute changes to its risk data. As of March
15, 2010, interested parties can monitor margins, position information, cash
fl ows, and margin requirements on any surplus or shortfall. All can be viewed
in real time on the site (Eurex Zurich 2010).
Great Britain
The repurchase agreement market in England is governed by the Securities
Lending and Repo Committee that was established in 1990 and the ster-
ling Money Markets Liaison Group established in 1999. New changes were
implemented in the repo market that began June 15, 2010.
Bids are accepted for two types of auctions, narrow collateral and wider
collateral. Wider-collateral bids are accepted for high-quality debt and are
longer lending terms. Narrow collateral bids are accepted for short-term
repos. Bidders can bid on each or both sets of collateral.
After the bidding process, a clearing rate is issued for wide and narrow
collateral. These auctions now occur once a month for a three-month and
six-month operation. Repo rates are now indexed to the Bank of England’s
(BOE) Bank Rate, currently 0.5 percent. Great Britain’s Bank Rate is like the

Fed funds rate in the United States. It is the price commercial banks pay on
reserve balances held in banks overnight. The interest rate earned equals the
bank rate at the close of the day.
The fi rst repo auction saw 83.37 percent collateral allotted to the narrow
set and 17.63 percent to the wider set of collateral. Changes in repo markets
stem from the 2008 economic crisis.
For the BOE, a shortage of gilts was recognized in the repo market.
This led to a shortage of liquidity. Because all central banks had liquidity
shortages during the crisis, Central banks of England, Switzerland, Canada,
and the ECB entered into swap agreements with the Federal Reserve to
obtain U.S. dollars for central bank-funding operations. Central banks
exchanged Treasury Bills for U.S. dollars. dollar-swap auctions began anew in
May 2010 for the BOE, ECB, SNB, and the Canadian Central Bank. Every
Wednesday, the BOE conducts seven-day repurchase agreements with the
Federal Reserve as needed. The purpose of the new system, based on the
2010 Quarterly Bulletin, is to limit volatility and ensure yield curves remain
at acceptable levels.
Canada
During the crisis, Canada established the Standing Liquidity Facility which
is employed to supply liquidity to banks and the markets. Many changes
occurred at the Bank of Canada (BOC).
The Bank either eliminated whole classes of securities used as collateral or
implemented higher margin requirements to prevent collateralization. The pre-
ferred list of collateral includes either Canadian dollar assets or U.S. Treasuries.
Margin requirements for U.S. Treasuries are consistent with Canadian assets
such as Canadian bonds, but a 4 percent rate is charged to account for FX risk.
Yet margins were raised. For example, Canadian Government Securities are
scheduled for 0.5 percent margin up to one-year maturities, 1.0 percent for
one to three years, 1.5 percent for three-to-fi ve years, and 2 percent for 5 to 10
years. For Canada guaranteed securities, 1.0 percent up to one year, 1.5 percent
for one-to-three years, 2 percent for three-to-fi ve years, and 2.5 percent for
5 to 10 years. These changes became effective in July 2010.
August 2010 saw a Bond Buy Back program implemented on most
Tuesdays at 11:15 a.m. Up to 18-month maturities can be sold back where
the total amount is greater than $5 billion. The Canadian overnight repo rate
is a weighted average rate of overnight GC repo trades. The market is open

from 6:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. eastern time. If $500 million is reported, the
repo rate is set at the BOC overnight rate. This translates to the BOC LIBOR
rate, termed OMMFR. Canadian repo trades settle through the Long Value
Transfer System (LVTS).
The BOC maintains its target rate between CORRA and the Overnight
Money Market Financing Rate, a weighted average of repo-funding costs of
major money-market dealers. While swap lines are open from the Federal
Reserve since it reopened, the BOC has not used this facility.
One method to track Canadian repo rates is by the overnight Repo Rate
Futures contract traded on the Montreal Futures Exchange and called ONX.
It is modeled after the Federal Funds Futures contract in the United States.
The ONX contract determines what the CORRA rate is expected to aver-
age over one month’s time (Johnson 2003). It is quoted as 100 minus the
monthly average overnight repo rate for the contract month and priced as
0.005, which equals CAD 20.55 (1/2 of 1/100 of 1 percent of 5,000,000 on
a 30-day basis). The Canadian dollar is priced within this context and repre-
sents the fl oor for rates.
Europe
GC trades go through Eurex Repo. Europe comprises a series of rates that
govern their operations. Much has been written about the channel or corridor
of rates that governs their markets. The Main Refi nancing Operation (MRO)
provides weekly liquidity based on minimum bid rates to the banking system.
The current rate is 1 percent. This fi xed rate has been higher than EURIBOR
and GC rates for 2010 (ECB yearly report 2010). The Marginal Lending
Facility provides overnight credit to banks. This rate is currently 1.75 percent
and the Deposit Facility is 0.25. Factor in the base rate at 0.12 presently, and
the corridor is established. Minimum bid rates normally establish Europe’s
Eurepo rate or deposit rate.
Australia
Australia’s top Cash Rate is the same as the Prime Rate in the United States
and is currently 4.50 percent. This rate hit a low of 3.00 percent in February
2009 and has been rising ever since. This says Australia’s economy has weath-
ered the fi nancial storm since the Lehman Brothers collapse far better than
its counterparts.

What further helped Australia was this quote from the March 2010
Financial Stability Report, “Six months to January 2010, total deposits in
Australia increased by an annualized rate of 4 1/2 percent, 2008 to 2009 saw
total deposits increase by 25 percent.”
Australia’s central bank, the Royal Bank of Australia (RBA), conducts
open-market operations at 9:30 a.m. Bank repo bids and offers begin at 9:30
Australia time and end at 9:45. All bank operations conducted by repo trans-
actions are incorporated by GC trades.
During the crisis, bank funding operations expanded to daily through
the Intraday Liquidity Facility beginning at 7:30 Australia time and ending
at 5:30 p.m. Sydney.
Repo rates begin at 0 and are determined by the market value of securi-
ties offered in the fi rst leg of the repo transaction. The second leg determines
fi rst-leg monies plus transaction costs. Margin calls are made when the value
of securities falls under 1 percent. If a security trades above the 1 percent
threshold, a return is made. Trades settle on an Actual/360 basis through
Austraclear on a delivery-versus-payment basis.
U.S. dollar Term Repo Operations rates are published at 10:15 a.m.,
settled on an Actual/360 basis and reported at 10:15 a.m. The minimum bid
is $5 million. The RBA employs the 10:00 a.m. William Reuters Australian
fi x for Aussie dollar equivalents. Yet the RBA charges an additional 10 percent
margin for foreign exchange risk.
The Guaranteed Scheme for Large Deposits and Wholesale Funding was
employed during the crisis but closed in March 2010. Historic repurchase
agreement totals in Australia-dollar terms forecasted a warning for market
direction, then signaled an all-clear sign. In Australian billions of dollars,
2004 to 2005 saw 4,461 in repurchase agreement deals, 2005 to 2006 saw
4,421, 2006 to 2007 saw 4,415, 2007 to 2008 saw 3,885, and 2008 to 2009
saw 5,147 (2009 Australian Financial Markets Report).
For the Australian dollar, the OCR would always serve as the deposit rate
in the Aussie market.
Repo Rates and Spot Currencies
Recognize that two repo rates and two different markets exist, one for an offi -
cial government rate and one for the private interbank market. This was cre-
ated by osmosis, by necessity due to market stress before and after Lehman,
but proceeded further with other crisis announcements of bank failures, bank
stress tests, and the Greek debt crisis. A crisis of confi dence existed.

As important as this market is to inform other rates, all central banks
had to review this market. Changes will occur. One obvious change is the
renewed daily focus for central banks to guide market operations toward their
target rates. This translates to guiding monetary policy toward the Consumer
Price Index. This can only mean repo rates may be steered toward the target
of infl ation. Targets have a range but a small window. This may require a
restriction to the repo market as higher margins and quality collateral may
be the cost of business. Most important about this scenario is that repo rates
establish a fl oor, the bottom of interest rates. Spot prices can’t fall below this
fl oor, regardless of the pair.
For spot-currency traders, the way to gauge this market is to monitor
repurchase agreement rates, reverse-repurchase rates, and bid/ask spreads.
Negative spreads mean the same masses of liquidity will only swirl around
without direction in defl ationary environments. Falling repo rates mean the
same. Because repo rates are the shortest of rates, they can provide early
signs toward recovery and higher policy rates or defl ation and lower rates.
Either way, this situation in turn will send currency pairs back to trends, up
or down.
Another method is to gauge repo rates against deposit rates as deposit
rates are the risk-free rate. The Japanese chart a trend line of repo rates against
repo trades that range from overnight to one year to gauge market direction.
The Bank of England charts an implied repo rate in two ways.
The fi rst is to compare repo rates based on Government bond gilt
yields because gilts were the preferred collateral. The second method is to
calculate the implied three-month LIBOR rate. This is defi ned by the BOE
as the average difference between the three month LIBOR rate and a bank
repo rate. The difference between these two rates is both are the shortest of
rates and repo rates are secured loans while LIBOR is the next open-market
rate that is unsecured. Market circumstances dictate preferred methods of
evaluation, yet market circumstances also dictate trends or ranges in spot
currency prices.

trading decisions. For the repo market, to know what types of collateral are
offered and accepted, and the direction of rates, can provide valuable insight
to direction in swaps, derivatives, fi xed income, and spot foreign exchange.
For example, suppose last week or last month German Bonds were offered
and accepted in the repo market at X rate. But this week, only U.S. Treasuries
were offered and accepted at X rate. Does that scenario warn of a credit prob-
lem, either temporary or long term, and would the euro/U.S. dollar, British
pound/U.S. dollar, Australian dollar/U.S. dollar, and New Zealand dollar/
U.S. dollar experience sell orders streaming? Absolutely.
Dollar Repos or Swap Lines
The proper name of these auctions is termed Reciprocal Currency Arrangements.
When crisis grips the world or any associated fi nancial problems, foreign central
banks borrowing costs in their own currency in both LIBOR and Overnight
Indexed Swaps rise, particularly those liabilities that are funded in U.S. dollars.
To meet these obligations, the U.S. Federal Reserve established currency
swap lines to alleviate foreign central banks high borrowing costs. Throughout
2007 to 2009, swap lines were open every Tuesday for the BOE, BOJ, SNB,
BOC, and ECB, with the results of auctions reported every Thursday on
the Federal Reserve web site. This schedule remains the same. As of May 10,
2010, the Fed announced the reopening of swap lines until Jan 2011 but has
since been extended to August 2011. It remains a monetary “tool” based on
the Federal Reserve Act 1913, section 14 to be reopened if crisis again grips
world banking systems.
Swaps entail each central bank to fi rst sell their own currency to the Fed in
exchange for U.S. dollars at current market rates and buy back their currency
at a specifi ed time at the agreed-upon rate in the fi rst leg (Fleming 2009).
These are periods of volatility for spot pairs, due fi rst to market uncertainties
then to a normalization of the market when LIBOR and other associated rates
stabilize thanks to Fed auctions. Currency markets experience selloffs at the
fi rst sign of crisis but trend back up when the auctions materialize (Goldberg
2010 and 2011). Interesting is the recent development of the ECB and BOE
to establish swap lines among each other, a fi rst which deserves attention.

and address short-term liquidity needs and provide currency swap arrange-
ments (EMEAP 2010 Report). Initial funding was considered at $80 billion
U.S. dollars, but fi nal funding was $120 billion U.S. dollars. Final agree-
ments were reached at the May 2009 meeting, signed in December 2009,
and became effective in March 2010. What this means in terms of currency
funding is a guess. Consider Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, the
European Union, and the United States are all members of ASEAN. Where
this agreement will lead is another question. Some speculate on an Asian
Currency Unit such as the euro. Yet another swap line may be an open and
viable vehicle that contrasts with the Fed’s Swap Lines.
Conclusion
Provided in this chapter was a detailed nation-by-nation look into the repo
market outlined by histories and parameters of the market from an over-
all perspective due to economic conditions that forced the market to halt.
A detailed perspective on the operational parameters for each market was
then provided. Each nation holds a vastly different view of their repo lending
and borrowing activity with various methodologies that ensure the repo and
reverse market function. Repo market participants vary from market to mar-
ket as well and the times lending and borrowing occur, because a wide differ-
entiation of time zones exist from nation to nation. Examples of repo trades
were provided, as well as various calculations of interest. Formulas were pro-
vided that allow anyone to calculate the same interest as market participants.
An insight into each nation’s futures market as a guide to repo trades and
market intelligence was provided. For the spot trade, repo markets provide
the fl oor, the bottom of interest rates, and the bottom for a particular nation’s
currency price. To understand factors of interest will assist in the understand-
ing of the next interest rate and the fi rst open market tradeable rate, LIBOR.

CHAPTER 5
LIBOR
LIBOR is an imperative chapter because it represents the shortest-term
open-market interest rate after a General Collateral (GC) repo rate that is
widely anticipated, widely viewed, and widely traded every trading day. It is an
open market rate and the fi rst rate to inform other rates in all markets. Because
LIBOR is priced to the currency, it is one of the most important of rates as a
trading day begins. This chapter addresses the various types of LIBOR and the
various interest rates associated with each rate in order to understand a spot
price. LIBOR may begin in the United Kingdom but LIBOR interest travels
to all markets and is informed by an internal LIBOR inside each nation’s
bank market. Two types of LIBOR are released and each are associated with a
different interest rate. The chapter begins with details of the LIBOR process.
When major banks submit bids and offers through the British Bankers
Association (BBA), what is represented is London banks that borrow and
lend money in terms of various nations’ currencies from their reserves to each
other. Bank A may have more reserves due to daily transactions and is willing
to lend, while Bank B found a defi cit due to transactions and is willing to
borrow. As lender, Bank A will submit a high offer to earn revenue while
Bank B will submit low bids to cover their defi cit at a low cost.
Banks must meet daily reserve requirements due to each nation’s laws and
regulations that address such issues as how much defi cit is allowed and how
much reserves can be lent, so what occurs at the BBA every day is the bid and
offer for unsecured currencies in terms of a particular nation’s deposit rates.
The fi gure released is the day’s interbank dealing rate, called LIBOR, a term
to denote deposit rates.
LIBOR, the most sensitive of open-market rates, is the rate that allows
other investment instruments the world over to be priced in the market for
that day and over a term of 12 months such as spot currency prices, swaps,

forwards, government bonds and yields, stock markets, options, and futures.
It is the rate that allows day traders to profi t, to hedge, and to trade their
views on any investment instruments and it allows private banks to profi t and
central banks to fund their operations and manage their reserves. For con-
sumers, this is the rate charged or at least considered for mortgages, student
loans, and consumer credit.
For central bankers, it is the rate to understand their operational targets
for their reserves, which in turn will facilitate the managing of reserves to
properly fund their economies. BBA LIBOR sets the framework, the founda-
tion. A typical example is the Swiss National Bank who employs a Swiss franc
three-month BBA LIBOR as its target rate to manage the Swiss economy in
terms of reserves and infl ation.
The operational framework for the Swiss economy is zero to three months,
priced in Swiss francs. Due to the wide band, central banks implemented
an operational daily rate for protection to further manage the three-month
target. This occurred for many central banks around the time of the introduc-
tion of the euro. The daily rate gives indication to economic direction and
target ranges.
Central banks like to see daily rates in the middle of the overall three-
month target so they know the three-month target will materialize without
extra costs to their reserves. Above the target means infl ation, an erosion of
prices, and an unexpected cost to reserves if infl ation grows too quickly. Below
means economic under-performance and another cost to reserves. Both must
be adjusted by reserves, but each has the potential to be more costly without
daily rates as a guide to the target.
For exchange rates and spot currencies, daily rates led to the understand-
ing of trends and ranges, entry and exits, profi t and loss, and day trading
versus swing trading as central banks better managed their economies. Some
central banks are better than others in management but sometimes that led
to more profi ts as currencies experienced larger swings in one instance and
certain trends in another. But the daily rate actually led to more sophistica-
tion in the markets as the management function by central banks became a
bit easier. Trends became real and much stronger.
The anomaly to LIBOR is U.S. SEC Rule 2a-7 that amends the Investment
Company Act of 1940 that places regulations on tax exempt money market
funds, a traditional source of funds for banks to borrow reserves. Beginning
May 2010, fi nal rules state that fund assets must be readily convertible to cash,
report monthly holdings, limit portfolio holdings from a weighted average
maturity of 90 to 60 days, and hold net asset values steady. The Committee
of Securities Regulators in Europe are considering the adoption of the same

rules. Rules stem from the Basel 3 Accord recommendations. Before we begin,
notice another anomaly to LIBOR, SONIA and EURONIA Index rates.
SONIA and EURONIA Indices
SONIA and EURONIA Indices are the inventions of the Wholesale Market
Brokers Association (WMBA) in London who are experts in not only all
markets sterling but money markets in Great Britain and Europe. The
SONIA Index was introduced in 1997 and it represents unsecured sterling
cash transactions that occur only in the overnight market in London from
midnight to 4:15 a.m., New York time. The WMBA brokers minimum
deals of sterling 25 million by WMBA member fi rms to counter parties—
other banks.
The proper name is sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA). It is a
weighted-average index with a weighted average rate at four decimal places.
“Rates in the average are weighted by the principal amount of deposits on a
particular day.” (LWMBA site 2010)
EURONIA is the euro Overnight Index Average, a weighted average to
four decimal places and introduced in January 1999 along with the euro. The
WMBA brokers deals for their member fi rms to counter parties based on
EURONIA rates in euros between midnight and 4:00 a.m., New York time.
Both track overnight funding rates, better known as deposit rates and both
are published by the WMBA at 1700 hours London time each day, 5:00 a.m.
New York time. What occurs are swaps where short-term loans are funded by
deposits against a rate in the index, a fi xed rate as opposed to a fl oating-rate
deal. Rates are based on deposit rates for a particular day. Sterling money-
market trades all go through Clearing House Automated Payment System
(CHAPS) sterling. CHAPS is operated and all trades recorded by the Bank
of England (BOE).
SONIA, LIBOR, and British Pound Sterling/U.S. Dollar
The gauge for SONIA and British pound sterling LIBOR lies in the spread.
The closer the spread in basis points, the more secure are money markets in
terms of lending and borrowing with less risk. When spreads widen, it is an
early warning sign to market risk as the cost of money increases. Would Bank
B from the previous example be willing to cover reserve defi cits in three-
month LIBOR with wide spreads?

==================================================

106 Inside the Currency Market
To track these rates, always look at the three-month LIBOR because that
is the rate viewed by central banks to determine what their own cost will be in
terms of their reserve target. Three-month rates give central banks operational
direction, a rate that suggests confi dence or disaster ahead. For major compa-
nies, conducting business in pounds sterling may not be affordable for costs
in future three-month rates since they work on a quarterly basis in terms of
their profi t margins. Those companies may fi nd another currency to conduct
present business or repatriate in another currency if they are not domesticated
in Great Britain. Both have huge interests in LIBOR and SONIA rates.
Widening spreads is a sell British pound sterling/U.S. dollar and a buy
in euro/British pound sterling while narrow spreads is a buy British pound
sterling/U.S. dollar and sell euro/British pound sterling due to opposite cor-
relational differences. Correlational differences allow funding in either pair,
and market rates dictate which pair.
For EURONIA, the same principles as for SONIA hold true. Widening
spreads between EURONIA and BBA euro signal higher borrowing costs in the
European money markets, so sell euro/U.S. dollar and consider buying U.S. dollar/
Swiss franc as both are direct opposite pairs. For close spreads that distill confi -
dence in borrowing costs, buy euro/U.S. dollar and sell U.S. dollar/Swiss franc.
As shown in Exhibit 5.1, the SONIA rate released August 4, 2010 was 4906.
What transpired upon release was a number of interbank transactions along
the interest-rate curve for that day that totaled more than $11 billion. Rates
refl ect the demand for money denominated in sterling at whatever agreed-upon
rate. The majority transacted at the index rate says that bankers see a steady eco-
nomic condition ahead. The key for the index is to determine the direction of
money either in higher or lower rates. That will transpire into a British pound
sterling/U.S. dollar price ahead. The same applies for EURONIA.
The rate released that day was 2790 and more than $17 billion in euros
was transacted through the interbank market at various rates along the inter-
est-rate curve. Once the rate is released, major banks post offers and bid-
ders accept offers based on their need for capital. The factor for SONIA and
EURONIA is it informs future LIBOR and determines the direction in the
cost and supply of money, which will refl ect the euro/U.S. dollar market price.
While these two examples represent overnight rates, the BBA releases
LIBOR for 10 currencies with 15 maturities that range from overnight to
12 months. For currency traders, the questions must be where is the greatest
demand for money, denominated in which currency, and where is the greatest
demand along the interest rate curve?
Rising demand with higher rates can only mean a rising currency price,
a trend. Trends through higher costs for money usually denote economic

confi dence and possibly higher policy rates later. This is the perfect growth
and infl ation scenario, where higher policy rates follow trends in higher costs
for money because money multiplies through higher rates.
Falling demand with lower rates is a defl ationary trend down and rates
that are up one day and down the next is a range trade. This formula nor-
mally doesn’t hold when crisis or uncertain economic times exist. During
crisis situations the reverse scenario holds true; sell rates above target and buy
dips when prices are below target. Because LIBOR is the start of market rates,
LIBOR is considered the smart money because it is the largest world banks
willing to spend reserves, deposit money on a specifi c rate.
A rising euro rate and a falling U.S. dollar may mean swap and forward
interest-rate positioning changes, importers and exporters readjust, manufac-
turers adjust profi t margins, banks earn profi ts through fi nance, central banks
adjust to their target rates, and traders profi t from a mismatch of rates.
During good economic times, LIBOR tends to rise for many nations
and grouped currency pairs trend. This includes the euro/U.S. dollar British
pound sterling/U.S. dollar, Australian dollar/U.S. dollar, and New Zealand
dollar/U.S. dollar, while U.S. dollar/Swiss franc, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen,
and U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar rates tend to fall due to opposite correla-
tional differences between the pricing interplay of government bond prices
and bond yields. It is the difference between safety and risky currencies.
One old method to gauge LIBOR is to plot LIBOR against any gov-
ernment-bond yields and draw a trend line to determine at what yield are
LIBOR comfortable and where is the point where the majority of rates set-
tle against yields? Higher LIBOR could mean higher yields, as both could
directly correlate. The guiding principle is money must always seek its
yield if that currency is a risk currency and tied to yield for its movement.
But fi nd the opposite correlations between government bond prices and
LIBOR to determine where safe currencies are comfortable. But this sce-
nario represents BBA LIBOR. These rates must transfer to each nation. A
few examples follow.
To understand the importance of LIBOR and ramifi cations of a currency
price, see Exhibit 5.2, the historic U.S. dollar LIBOR chart from the January
2007 high of 5.32 and the 0.23 low in January 2010.
As noted in Exhibit 5.3, from 2007 to 2008, U.S. dollar prices refl ected
the trend line fall in LIBOR, 2008 saw choppy rate releases, and 2010 saw
the original 2007 dollar index 78 price to refl ect the real trend. The 2007 fall
didn’t begin until October, but prior LIBOR prices and failures to rise was
probably an early warning to U.S. dollar direction.
The caveat is LIBOR doesn’t follow a tick-by-tick rise or fall in currency
prices; rather it follows and alerts to trend direction. Small ranges may occur

in currency prices as LIBOR ebbs and fl ows from day to day, but LIBOR can
be the best alert to an overall trend.
For direction, plot a trend line, a moving average, or a standard deviation to
determine where the mean of LIBOR lies. Markets and rates always normalize
and always revert back to a mean. Look for the outliers, the place where LIBOR
falls outside the mean. Those rates are anomalies. Direction can be ascertained
based on a normalization and a currency pair such as the U.S. dollar or euro/
U.S. dollar can be gauged due to opposite correlations and profi t earned.

are submitted traditionally in November, with the fi nal budget submitted
in March (House of Commons 2010). This period covers fi scal years for
the British pound sterling and the U.K. Government. Interestingly, does the
British pound sterling/U.S. dollar peak during this period along with British
pound sterling LIBOR? The answer is no. The peak comes for the British
pound sterling/U.S. dollar around the November/December period.
BBA and LIBOR
It should be noted the importance of the LIBOR. A LIBOR number is tied to
a vast majority of the world’s markets in terms of mortgages, consumer loans,
student loans, investments, and savings that the release of LIBOR is so vital
to the continued maintenance of the fi nancial system. For this reason, the
BBA guards this number jealously. It is important for market professionals to
obtain a true number, a true release, so a valid fi nancial decision can be ren-
dered. The fi gure released is a tradeable rate in the interbank and money mar-
kets. The major data vendors around the world are the most reliable sources,
such as Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg, because of their worldwide opera-
tions and their ability to report up-to-the-second events.
Seasonal Spot Currencies and LIBOR
For seasonal currency prices, see Exhibit 5.2, the historical monthly charts
from 1999 to 2010 and notice that for most years, the highest LIBOR for the

==================================================

LIBOR 111
U.S. dollar occurred in or around November. This trend held from 1999 to
2007 and for the most part will probably hold for future years.
My personal theory why this occurs surrounds the fact that U.S. govern-
ment budgets are normally voted and passed in October due to fi scal year
end. Major U.S. companies tend toward fi scal years in line with U.S. govern-
ment fi scal years and write a budget the same time as the U.S. government.
So both entities conduct their heaviest borrowing in November to fund new
budgets and force dollar costs up due to demand for dollars.
The European Union, the U.S. dollar opposite to the euro, historically
passes their budgets in November (Europa.eu 2010) so must borrow heav-
ily in euros in December. Again see Exhibit 5.2. From 1999 to 2003, dol-
lar LIBOR either dropped or remained the same in December. From 2004
to 2010, U.S. dollar LIBOR dropped in December 2004, remained close
to November levels in 2005, dropped in 2006, 2008, and and 2009. At a
December LIBOR of 5.24 in 2007 and a December 2008 rate of 1.90, 2007
is the outlier rate mentioned above.
Notice in December of Exhibit 5.4, the 2007 chart of the euro/U.S.
dollar denoted by a rising trend line of higher LIBOR and further notice the
December 2008 rise due to a reduction of U.S. dollar LIBOR.

112 Inside the Currency Market
Historically, the euro/U.S. dollar peaks somewhere in the November/
December period. What may misalign rates is economic crisis, market uncer-
tainties such as our present condition, or a central bank interest-rate change.
Note rates may misalign, but they always normalize back to trend.
For traders to denote trends, compare overnight to three-month LIBOR
to determine how far rates are predicted to rise or fall, where is the greatest
rise or fall, and in what currency. Currency-pair prices fall within this range
under normal conditions.
For the vast majority of central banks, the-three month LIBOR is their
prime number of importance, but it is the overnight to three-month rate that
is tracked for a whole host of reasons. The fi rst is how much will borrowing
cost be in three months and will that cost allow the central bank to meet its
infl ation-target rate. If not, central banks then adjust their reserves to bring
that three-month rate in order. This scenario doesn’t help trend traders and
actually forced many to become day traders due to market uncertainties and
central bank intervention of the three-month rate.
This present crisis really forced central banks to take a harder look at
their operations. The trend in the last few years has been to limit volatility
in overnight rates so a central bank can streamline its daily operations, meet
its target rate, and not get caught by an unexpected outlier of a rate that will
cost them more than expected and shock their economies. Explicit in central
bank reports is limit volatility, fl attening the yield curve, and getting to the
next central bank meeting, to borrow the BOE approach. Yet this example
holds true for all now.
Central banks are the money masters and in turn expert managers of
their economies. If any institution sees trouble or good times ahead, it is the
central banks, and they provide early warnings. For example, ever wonder
why the Federal Reserve pays reserve interest on their Fed funds rate when
that rate is presently 0.25?
Maintenance Periods
The Federal Reserve Board established in 2008 what it calls maintenance peri-
ods. These are weekly periods during which banks must maintain required
reserves. Maintenance periods cover 14 consecutive days (Federal Reserve
Manual 2010). Required reserves began as Regulation D that appeared fi rst in
the Federal Reserve Act of 1978 then carried forward to the 1980 Monetary
Control Act that imposed mandatory reserve requirements (Federal Reserve
Maintenance Manual 2010). All governments then imposed reserve laws and

                     PAGE 127                     
==================================================

LIBOR 113
this gave rise to the need for the BBA, as reserves had to be priced and bal-
anced in line with central bank target rates.
To pay interest on reserves was scheduled for 2011 with passage of the
Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006 but moved forward by
Congress to 2008 with passage of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act
of 2008 (Federal Reserve 2010).
Overdrafts are charged and reserves are credited an Effective Fed funds
rate defi ned as a volume-weighted average rate of trades. Required reserves
are credited an average targeted Fed funds rate minus 10 basis points, while
excess reserves are credited the lowest targeted Fed funds rate minus 75 basis
points (Federal Reserve 2010).
With a Fed funds target rate currently at 0.25, with hardly a possibility
to sustain itself above due to crisis conditions, the Fed had to ensure this
rate would never trade to zero or worse, trade a negative. Instead they had to
shift reserves toward or in line with the target rate. See Exhibits 5.5 and 5.6
and notice that without required reserves, Fed fund rates would have traded
to 0. Exhibit 5.7 provides actual Fed funds trades before, during, and after
Maintenance Periods. Notice current Fed funds target rates are 0.00 to 0.25
so trading ranges will normally fall within this period unless crisis occurs or
the market prices in an interest rate hike.

Mac Gorain in 2005 expertly outlined how the BOE maintains its 0.5
target by managing reserves so supply will equal demand to limit volatility
until the next Monetary Policy Committee meeting. The central banks of
Canada, Switzerland, and Japan, and the European Central Bank (ECB) all
adopted some type of reserve policy and all have a unique way to achieve their
desired target. See Exhibit 5.8. The number of maintenance periods changes
based on the month. It’s based on the demand and supply of euros. Did inter-
est paid to reserves presage crisis times ahead?
Prior to maintenance periods, central banks borrowed for the next month
during the last week of the prior month. Currency traders knew never to
trade at this time due to volatile and sometimes wild market swings as central
bank monies swung currency pairs wildly and without warning. For these
and many reasons, the three-month LIBOR target is of profound importance
to traders, central banks, private banks, and market professionals because it
represents the prime cost of funds over a period of time. More important is to
factor reserve periods for each central bank as LIBOR can be affected and in
turn affects currency pair prices and movements.
The question possibly not yet fully answered is what are the effects
to LIBOR in terms of maintenance periods and currency prices?
Schlegel and Kraenzlin 2009 found that in the Swiss market after main-
tenance periods, a steeper demand curve was evident. This can only raise
central bank borrowing costs along with LIBOR, and in turn affect cur-
rency prices in the context of economic conditions and trends as the
demand for money increases once maintenance periods end each month.

More important is what is the direction for a particular nation’s money
during maintenance periods? Another question that must be addressed
is what is the payout in maintenance-period funds as opposed to market
rates? This question addresses issues of supply and demand for money.
This phenomenon sends currency pairs up toward weakness with increased

transfer within each nation. Provided is an example of each nation’s inter-
nal LIBOR interest rates.
EURIBOR
The EURIBOR acronym is the European Interbank Offered Rate and is
overseen by the European Banking Federation in Brussels. This rate, in 15
maturities from one week to 12 months, is the gauge for term deposits in the
euro zone on a daily basis excluding holidays. Currently, 42 banks comprise
the Steering Committee that bids and offers for euros and the Fix time is
11:00 CET. A closer view of rates inside the euro zone will help gauge the
exact rates banks pay for euros and the movement of the euro.
See in Exhibit 5.9 the historical 12-month chart of EURIBOR and further
see in Exhibit 5.10 historic euro/U.S. dollar charts, and notice how EURIBOR
rates normally begin to ascend in the summer and peak in the fall, and a

rise in the euro/U.S. dollar normally follows the ascension. Also notice the
euro/U.S. dollar traded its highest levels of the year in November/December
every year since 1999.
From the 12-month EURIBOR chart, notice how EURIBOR rates rose
during 2008 and 2009 and notice from the chart how the euro/U.S. dollar
fell. From 2009 to 2010, EURIBOR rates fell and notice how the euro/U.S.
dollar rose. Notice from the historical 12-month chart of EURIBOR and
recognize in the fi rst four years of the euro introduction, as EURIBOR
rates rose, the euro/U.S. dollar fell and from 2003 to 2006, EURIBOR rates
ranged along with the euro/U.S. dollar. Yet this pair followed EURIBOR
rates up in 2006 and 2007. Crisis times occurred, and EURIBOR rates and
the euro/U.S. dollar followed normal trends again from its early beginnings
in 2008 and 2009. This is a typical example of a currency pair that must
seek its yield. This means it must earn its highest rate. The answer to why
can be found within EONIA.

EONIA
EONIA is the euro Overnight Index Average, a weighted average of all
overnight unsecured lending deals. EONIA lending is for one-day to
24-month transactions and the fi xing time is 19:00 CET. Look at EONIA
as the Effective Funds rate for the United States. More importantly, it is
the effective rate for EURIBOR simply due to its weight average factor
against EURIBOR.
Notice Exhibit 5.11, the 12-month historical chart of EONIA
rates and Exhibit 5.10 historic euro/U.S. dollar. From 1999 to 2004,
the euro/U.S. dollar movements tracked opposite the EONIA rates. As
EONIA rates went up, euro/U.S. dollar fell and vice versa. From 2003 to
2006 rates held steady, but 2006 to 2008 saw the euro/U.S. dollar track
alongside EONIA rates with a normalization of original trend beginning
in 2008 to 2010. The euro/U.S. dollar tracks EONIA rates up only when
a demand for euros is evident such as in November/December when new
budgets take effect or during good economic times when the euro zone
economy is healthy and policy rates are expected to rise. Typically,
EONIA and EURIBOR have an inverse relationship for most euro/U.S.
dollar circumstances.

Track EURIBOR and EONIA Rates
Euronext trades a EURIBOR/EONIA Swap Index futures contract. In
this instance, EONIA is a mid-market rate that is calculated at 11:00 a.m.
CET. Since 2008, the one-month EONIA contract and the three-month
EONIA Swap Index aligned in terms of trade and settlement to central bank
maintenance periods. The EONIA three-month contract tracks normal
International Money Market dates while the one-month contract is aligned
to European maintenance periods.
EONIA contract prices are quoted in percents to three decimal places
and factored as 100 minus the traded average effective EONIA rate. Prices are
quoted as 0.005 is equal to 12.50 euros.
EURIBOR prices are quoted in percents to three decimal places as 100
minus the rate of interest, 0.005 is equal to12.50 euros. Trades can be viewed
almost in real time on the euronext site.
EURIBOR and EONIA are the determining factors that inform all
European rates. They set the foundation, the fl oor.
Euro, EURIBOR, and EONIA
From an ECB and euro Governmental perspective, both would like to see
cheaper borrowing costs to their currency to allow a greater demand for euro
exports. Yet importers to the euro zone experience higher costs for their prod-
ucts due to a misalignment of rates that stems from EURIBOR and EONIA
prices. EURIBOR and EONIA must be balanced against imports to exports
yet all must be balanced against an ECB three-month target rate to allow
infl ation to remain sustained. This is Mundell-Fleming taken to the next
level. The euro/U.S. dollar spot price can only fall between, above, or below
these rates. Because the U.S. dollar has a direct opposite correlation to the
euro, tracking the U.S. dollar for euro direction is paramount.
EURIBOR and EONIA rates will ebb and fl ow over any three-month time
period as market and economic circumstances dictate so the euro/U.S. dollar
will also ebb and fl ow. But as EURIBOR and EONIA rates rise, chances are
good U.S. dollar rates will fall and vice versa over a three-month target period.
This is the point of profi t, the point of direction, the point of entry and exit,
the point of decision as to which side of euro/U.S. dollar to go long or short.
For example, what if U.S. dollar Fed funds rate hit a high of 2700? With a
current 0.25 Fed funds target and no chance to raise rates in todays’ economic
conditions, chances are good 2700 is above target and the U.S. dollar should

==================================================

LIBOR 121
be sold against the euro because the cost for the U.S. dollar is too high. The
Federal Reserve can’t sustain fi nance costs at that level.
Yet what if rates at the three-month level came down? 2700 can be viewed
in a much different light and could be the sign to go long the U.S. dollar
against the euro due to signs that better economic conditions are ahead, as
refl ected by lower borrowing costs at the long end. This same scenario holds
for the euro in terms of EURIBOR and EONIA; both U.S. dollar and euro
rates ebb and fl ow in opposite movements to each other.
EURIBOR and EONIA rates can at times be diffi cult to gauge simply
because those rates must be viewed within the context of economic condi-
tions and because the euro is a currency that must seek and earn its yield.
Notice the composition of the euro/U.S. dollar and notice this is exactly
the order p referred by the ECB, while the U.S. dollar/euro is preferred by the
U.S. Federal Reserve. The question always should be how much does one
euro cost to one U.S. dollar and how much does one U.S. dollar cost to
one euro? Viewed in this context with EURIBOR and EONIA, a euro/U.S.
dollar spot determination can be better factored.
Australia and New Zealand
Why Australia and New Zealand run together is due to their historic and
peaceful ties, their enormous cross-border trade, and their shared and similar
market structure within their own economies and banking systems. The only
difference is both are separate sovereigns and each has a separate currency. Yet
both move in the markets almost in tandem as if they were the same currency.
Both operate with a top prime rate called the Offi cial Cash Rate (OCR), and
both operate with issuance of Bank Bills.
Bank Bills are short-term bills, securities issued by trading banks to
fi nance short-term fi nancing from 30 to 180 days. For this reason, Australia
and New Zealand are termed cash economies and Bank Bills are termed Cash
Rates because Bank Bills are backed by bank reserves such as certifi cates of
deposit and other deposits. Yet this is the rate that is of prime importance
to both economies because it represents the shortest of open-market rates.
Actual cash rates are factored by calculation of quarterly weighted-median-
infl ation rates. Bank Bills are to Australia and New Zealand what EURIBOR
is to Europe. The difference is banks and markets decide rates in Australia
and New Zealand rather than panel banks that bid and offer for money.
Their in-nation LIBOR is different. Australia factors its overnight rate
from the Interbank Overnight Cash Rate Survey, a survey of 25 Australian

banks (Australia Central Bank). The overnight rate is a weighted average of
funds lent and borrowed in the interbank market. For both economies, it is
the 90-day Bank Bill rate of prime interest to bankers, central banks, and
market professionals because that rate decides the cost of Australian and New
Zealand dollars as well as determines good or bad economies. The current
OCR rate in Australia is 4.50, and 3.00 for New Zealand.
See in Exhibit 5.12, the historic chart of the 90-day Bank Bill yield rate to
cash rates in Australia. Also see Exhibit 5.13, the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar

historic chart. Notice how as Bank Bill yields rise, Australian dollar/U.S. dollar
rises. Also notice how the cash rate serves as a buffer, an area of support.
The more telling story to an Australian dollar/U.S. dollar rise is the com-
parison to U.S. dollar cash rates. See Exhibit 5.14, Australian dollar versus
U.S. cash rates. Australian dollar cash rates are far above U.S. rates. The ques-
tion for traders should be where will money gain its greatest yield? In this
instance, it is the buy Australian dollar and sell the U.S. dollar. This again is
the typical carry trade as one currency is sold and the other is purchased to
fi rst gain yield then earn capital gains.
With an Australian OCR at 4.50 and U.S. rate of 0.25, a carry trader
is selling the 0.25 U.S. dollar and buying Australian dollar at 4.50 minus
U.S. dollar 0.25 with interest gained of 4.25 and paid daily in a rollover.
Australian dollar/U.S. dollar will always out-pace New Zealand dollar/U.S.
dollar in price and market movement because of the greater interest differ-
ential. Notice New Zealand’s 3.00 OCR and U.S. dollar 0.25. New Zealand
dollar/U.S. dollar carry trades earn 2.75 to Australia’s 4.25. This interest dif-
ferential is historic because Australian society is and has always been slightly

more progressive than New Zealand’s. Yet no other central bank is more for-
ward thinking than New Zealand’s Royal Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ).
For New Zealand, the story remains the same. See Exhibit 5.15, historic
chart of Bank Bills and OCR rates and Exhibit 5.16, historic chart of New
Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar. As Bank Bill rates rise above OCR rates, the
New Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar rises, and in some years it trends and ranges

when Bank Bills range. New Zealand reports Bank Bill yields daily at 11:10
as a mid-market rate, the same time as the TWI rates. Notice the real trend
down in rates from 2008 to 2009 as the world crisis hit. Bank Bill rates still
never broke OCR support. The story is the same when the New Zealand
dollar is compared to U.S. rates. This is the typical carry trade as money must
seek its yield, Australian dollar/U.S. dollar and New Zealand dollar/U.S.
dollar is always a buy-the-dip strategy with focus on Bank Bills to determine
entry and exit. The strategy should be: enter at OCR and let Bank Bills guide
the trade.

Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar peak in the later months and reach lows in the
beginning of the years. The reason for this scenario is the cost of trade
between New Zealand and Australia. More important may be the fact that
New Zealand governmental budgets are proposed in May. Further, summer
months in the United States are winter months in New Zealand and Australia
so the effects of trade are dramatic during these periods.
Australian Securities Exchange
The best method to track Australian and New Zealand Bank bills is through
the futures contract traded on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).
Each trade separately. Both 30- and 90-day New Zealand Bank Bills trade as
a futures contract with the ability to also trade options on the contract. The
ASX also trades a 30-day New Zealand OCR futures contract. Why? Because
New Zealand doesn’t trade futures and options, so any futures and option
trading are conducted through the ASX.
Short-term Interest Rates (STIR) is the method to fi nd short-term inter-
est-rate instruments in Australia, New Zealand, Europe, and euronext in the
United States.
OCR for both Australia and New Zealand represent deposit rates and
bank bills as the measure of direction for economic and costs of funds.
In economic terms, the guide is the 30- and 90-day Interbank Cash Rate
futures contracts. If the 90-day is above the 30 day, expect a rise in rates. If
the 90-day is below the 30-day rate, it signals a decline.
Bank Bills are priced based on yield to maturity with a 365-day count.
For example, a 90-day present value is determined as
Present value (cid:3) Face value (cid:4) 365/365 (cid:5) (yield (cid:4) days to maturity/100)
Face value (cid:3) Future value at the end of the 90 days
From an ASX site example:
A 90 day Bank Bill, face value 100,000, yield to maturity trades 5.50 percent
where
P (cid:3) 100,000 (cid:4) 365/365 (cid:5) (5.5 (cid:4) 90/100) (cid:3) 98.661.9
The 30-day Cash Rate Futures contract is settled at the cash-settlement
rate that equals the monthly average of the interbank overnight cash rate

divided by the number of days in a month and rounded to the nearest 0.001
percent. All are priced as 0.005 in basis point increments, 0.01 basis points is
equal to Australian dollar 24.66.
The process is the same for New Zealand, with the only difference in the price
of the contracts—Australian dollar is 5 million and New Zealand is 3 million.
Seasonality and Australian Dollar/U.S. Dollar,
New Zealand Dollar/U.S. Dollar
Both governments present budgets to their respective parliaments in May to
be voted on around the June/July period. And again, major companies pass
budgets during this time to coincide with government budgets. As was the case
for the British pound sterling/U.S. dollar, Australian dollar/U.S. dollar and
New Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar, they don’t necessarily peak during the June/
July period. Rather both peak around the November/December time frame.
What has occurred during July since 1999 for Australian dollar/U.S. dollar has
actually been up months historically, while the majority of months for New
Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar has actually been down. But both peak during the
November/December period. The question of Bank Bills and BBA LIBOR
cannot be a reliable indicator at the time of budget proposal and passage.
U.S. Dollar Pairs and LIBOR
An important point to note is the fi rst four pairs addressed were the euro/U.S.
dollar, British pound sterling/U.S. dollar, Australian dollar/U.S. dollar, and
New Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar. In these examples, U.S. dollar was the base
currency and it was sold with every rise of the quote currency and vice versa.
The same principle holds for these pairs as was discussed for trade weight
indices (TWIs).
Central banks and governments of these currency pairs want a rise in
prices. They want their currency fi rst in the quote position aligned with the
U.S. dollar as the base. For example, the euro/U.S. dollar may trade at, for
example, 1.2818 but the ECB and European governments would love to see
2.2818 or 3.2818. Under these circumstances, everybody associated with the
euro gains. European governments receive a boost to their economies from
increased export revenue that fl ows to them instead of the United States.
Major companies earn revenue from increased exports and profi ts. Central
banks earn foreign reserves that raise their balance sheets to better manage their

economies. Jobs are created with rising wages, rising consumer spending, and
rising interest rates that benefi t all and allow this economy to fl ourish as long
as the relationship holds. This relationship holds when the economic balance
isn’t so skewed in one direction, when interest rates to Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) and other economic factors are balanced. Same with the British pound
sterling/U.S. dollar, Australian dollar/U.S. dollar, and New Zealand dollar/
U.S. dollar since the United States is their largest and most-profi table market.
Notice how U.S. dollar/euro, U.S. dollar/British pound sterling, U.S. dollar/
Australian dollar and U.S. dollar/New Zealand dollar won’t work unless the
U.S. dollar was shorted. So the factor of LIBOR to a currency pair must be
viewed in the context of economic conditions. It is infl ation versus defl ation
where only one side of a pair can benefi t—one winner, one loser.
A rising LIBOR and a rising currency pair is good as long as conditions
are suffi cient as has been the case for Australian dollar/U.S. dollar and New
Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar. When economic conditions turn for Australian
dollar/U.S. dollar and New Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar, rising LIBOR will
be a hindrance to business because the cost of those dollars will be too high.
The next three currency pairs, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, U.S. dollar/Swiss
franc, and U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar have quite different arrangements
from their opposite counterparts due to the composition of the pairs. In this
instance, U.S. dollar is the quote and Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and Canadian
dollar are the base. LIBOR will work quite differently as we will see.
TIBOR and EUROYEN
The current Japanese top interest rate, termed the base rate, is 0.10 and their
overnight rate is called the Call Rate, an unsecured loan market where rates are
decided by bids and offers between 17 bankers inside Japan, with a 12:00 noon
published Tokyo time release (Japanese Bankers Association). The actual rate
is reported at 11:00 a.m. Tokyo time, 10:00 p.m. eastern time, and two hours
after the Tokyo Stock Exchange opens (or one hour depending on daylight sav-
ings time) but the number fi lters through the world by 12:00 noon Tokyo time
and is reported on the JBA site at 12:00 noon (Japanese Bankers Association).
This unsecured Call loan market is provided for TIBOR, the Tokyo
Interbank Offered Rate, to factor unsecured loans denominated in Japanese
yen. But TIBOR is a factor for Japanese loans inside Japan among Japanese
bankers and has nothing to do with trade outside of Japan.
With a base rate so low and an economy in a defl ationary downtrend
for many years, where could these rates possibly trade? See Exhibit 5.18, the

becomes expensive as borrowing occurs past the one-week rate.
Further notice Exhibit 5.19, the historic chart of EUROYEN TIBOR
against Exhibit 5.20, the historic chart of U.S. dollar/Japanese yen and
notice how little the U.S. dollar/Japanese yen moves in line with EUROYEN
TIBOR rates.
When the U.S. dollar/Japanese yen becomes too expensive, it aligns with
TIBOR. This occurred in August 2008, but the remainder of the world’s
currencies during that time suffered the same effects as during the month the
U.S. housing crisis was announced. Any spikes up or down in TIBOR were a
refl ection of world crisis rather than normal market movements, because the
Japanese can’t afford to have rates deviate too far from a norm due to defl a-
tionary environments.
TIBOR has leveled since 2009, yet the U.S. dollar/Japanese yen ebbed
and fl owed. For the most part, the U.S. dollar/Japanese yen has been in a
long-term downtrend that was never forecast nor refl ected through TIBOR.
What this means is TIBOR can’t be relied upon to trade the U.S. dollar/
Japanese yen inside or outside of Japan unless it is traded another way.
As was discussed with central banks and TWIs and interested pairs to a
central bank, look at U.S. dollar/Japanese yen differently. What if the order

was reversed to Japanese yen/U.S. dollar? This says TIBOR now refl ects this
relationship, as can be evident from early 2007 and the uptrend in Japanese
yen/U.S. dollar. TIBOR not only refl ects Japanese yen/U.S. dollar but
Japanese yen has actually been in an uptrend. In this instance, the U.S. dollar
was actually sold against the Japanese yen and led to an enormous uptrend
for Japanese yen. Because this is the order the Bank of Japan (BOJ) and the
Japanese government actually want, the uptrend has earned enormous foreign
reserves for the Japanese against the U.S. dollar. Looked upon another way,
why would the Japanese care about U.S. dollar conversions into Japanese
yen, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen? This composition doesn’t help initially until it
is time to repatriate. They need to know Japanese yen conversions into U.S.
dollars. This answers the question how much will it cost, how many Japanese
yen will it take to ship and sell its products in the United States and how
much will they earn in profi ts?
An even further way to look at this relationship is to factor exchange rates.
On August 11, 2009, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen was trading about 90.37 in

the spot price and on August 17, 2010, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen was trad-
ing at about 85.23. In exchange rate terms, August 2009 began 0.70530 and
ended August 2001 at 0.78020. It took many more U.S. dollars to convert to
Japanese yen, which was not good for a U.S. exporter. Conversely, Japanese
yen/U.S. dollar began August 11, 2009 at 0.01028 and ended August 17,
2010 at 0.0116920, good for the Japanese because they earn more yen against
the U.S. dollar and they earn their desired yield and foreign reserves.
For traders, it is good to track spot against exchange rates and TIBOR
because while Japanese bankers may have a desired level for TIBOR, it is
the prevailing economic conditions that dictate TIBOR. Caution is always
advised when betting against a central bank with a fi nancial interest in market
prices, especially the Japanese who are smart traders. Also be aware that this
discussion concerns Japanese and American market trading arrangements.
How this pair will trade in other markets, such as Europe, may be different.
Repatriation and the Yen
For repatriation purposes, let’s look at the U.S. dollar/Japanese yen and
Japanese yen/U.S. dollar relationships. Notice the historic TIBOR chart
and notice the Japanese central bank tracks U.S. Treasury bills and their
own T-Bill rates and again further notice Treasury-bill rates are always above
TIBOR. According to the August 2009 Treasury International Capital report
that tracks foreign investment in the United States, the Japanese are and have
been number two in purchases of U.S. Treasury securities for a number of
years (TIC Data 2011). As the Japanese earn profi ts in Japanese yen/U.S.
dollars, they purchase Treasuries with profi ts and wait for favorable exchange
rates in U.S. dollar/Japanese yen and transfer the money back to Japan.
Exchange rates and spot prices for U.S. dollar/Japanese yen and Japanese
yen/U.S. dollar ebb and fl ow, so the Japanese wait until the price is accept-
able then repatriate. Notice the Japanese government never complains about
Japanese yen/U.S. dollars but they speak volumes when U.S. dollar/Japanese
yen is not suffi cient a price.
EUROYEN
The EUROYEN is another Call market rate used to gauge rates in offshore
markets (Japanese Bankers Association). The term offshore market has many
variables, with arrangements that changed dramatically since the inception of

the EUROYEN in 1998. A whole host of academic literature exists that
explains the many connections of EUROYEN to Eurobonds to Eurodollars
and now directly to the money markets.
World governments assisted the yen to become internationalized with the
introduction of TIBOR in 1995 and EUROYEN in 1998 (Japanese Bankers
Association). EUROYEN’s introduction was enhanced by the introduction of
currency cross pairs during this period. Recognize TIBOR covered U.S. mar-
kets and EUROYEN assisted the yen in euro markets that further sealed the
goal of internationalization because both are Japan’s largest export markets.
Notice in Exhibit 5.21 the historical charts of euro/Japanese yen since
2007 and further notice Exhibit 5.22, historical charts of EUROYEN
TIBOR. The relationship has nearly perfect correlations, so EUROYEN can
be absolutely employed as a tool to forecast euro/Japanese yen movements.
Notice Exhibit 5.22, the August charts of EUROYEN, and recognize
higher rates as borrowings occur in later months. This can be viewed as a
possible early warning indicator of trouble ahead. Notice then the euro/

notice the relationship euro/Japanese yen has with U.S. dollar/Japanese yen
from Exhibit 5.20. Both correlate in market movements. Further notice
Exhibit 5.23 euro/Japanese yen trading on Euronext in Europe.
Notice how much cheaper EUROYEN rates are when compared to
TIBOR. This is the difference between an offshore and an onshore rate as
well as TIBOR quoted as 1 percent with a 365 day count and EUROYEN
with a U.S. and European 360 day count. The Japanese would actually like
to see EUROYEN rates low in defl ationary environments and high when
economic conditions improve. But each rate serves a different function. The
best method to trade these pairs together is to watch EUROYEN rates. If
short-term rates stream higher, chances are good trouble may be ahead due to
a defl ationary Japanese economy or detrimental economic condition outside
Japan that affects the cost of money. This would serve for trading in Japanese,
American, and Asian markets.
Yet if longer-dated rates edge down, this is an all-clear sign to go long
euro/Japanese yen because it says to the markets that no trouble is expected.
The euro/Japanese yen would take off in all markets, especially European and
U.S. markets. It is a question of confi dence.

LIBOR 137
Longer-dated rates on the way down say bankers are not worried about
defaults. Yet look at EUROYEN as a LIBOR. A high daily number normally
means a down day while a low number may signal an up day in American
and European markets. Rates will ebb and fl ow and euro/Japanese yen will
coincide with those fl ows. Finally, the pair of interest to the Japanese is the
Japanese yen/euro and the pair of interest to the Europeans is the euro/
Japanese yen. These pairs may trade quite differently in their respective
markets so both combinations should confi rm each other before a trade
decision.
For example, notice Exhibit 5.24, the three-month futures chart of
EUROYEN that trades on the Tokyo Futures Exchange and compare that chart
to Exhibit 5.25 euro/Japanese yen in May, June, and July 2010. EUROYEN
futures were up for the three-month period, yet euro/Japanese yen was down.
The caveat is that the three months includes all markets. EUROYEN released
as one rate only means the start of trading of that rate in the Japanese inter-
bank market. For the Japanese, Japanese yen/euro was actually up during
Tokyo trade from May to July. For traders, Japanese yen/euro should always
be looked upon as the long trade or short euro/Japanese yen in Asian trading
while Japanese yen/euro should be looked upon as the short trade and long
euro/Japanese yen in European and American markets as market conditions

enter at TIBOR and allow Japanese Treasury Bills to guide the trade.
Euronext and EUROYEN
While the Tokyo Futures Exchange trades EUROYEN futures, Euronext in
Europe also trades EUROYEN futures contracts, the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange (CME) trades futures contracts so anyone can track EUROYEN
from market to market and gauge euro/Japanese yen prices and direction. The
preferred method to trade Japanese yen/U.S. dollar is to measure the spread
between EUROYEN and Eurodollar futures because both have the same day
counts. EUROYEN is priced in yen and represents deposits in offshore mar-
kets while Eurodollars represents U.S. dollar deposits in Europe. Spreads will
determine direction as no better gauge exists as an early-warning sign to mea-
sure interest rates between these two pair arrangements. What is measured is
the cost of money—borrowing costs —so wider spreads say trouble exists.

LIBOR 139
Euro/Japanese Yen as a Risk Indicator
For U.S. markets, EUROYEN TIBOR trades in the money markets on the
CME. Research suggests that euro/Japanese yen is the only pair of this type
ever traded directly in the money markets. Many currency pairs trade as
futures contracts on the CME, but none trade directly in the money markets.
Because U.S. money markets are so sensitive due to the short-term nature of
many varied rates and varied fi nancial instruments, euro/Japanese yen is clas-
sifi ed as a market-risk indicator by market convention.
euro/Japanese yen as a risk indicator measures risk for carry trades and
provides overall direction for all other currency pairs because of direct oppo-
site correlations of this pair. When risk grips the markets, euro/Japanese yen
TIBOR will soar, so carry trades will be the fi rst instrument sold and euro/
Japanese yen will be the fi rst instrument to feel the market effects. Early-
warning or all-clear signs for American market trading can occur during
European market trading, as continuity for the most part exists from market
to market, continent to continent for euro/Japanese yen.
When trouble grips the markets, money fi nds safety in non-risk assets
and non-risk currency pairs. Risky markets means money fl ows into U.S.
dollar/Swiss franc, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar, euro/
British pound sterling, Australian dollar/New Zealand dollar, and British
pound sterling/New Zealand dollar. This sends these pairs toward weak-
ness, so go long these pairs in times of market stress and short euro/U.S.
dollar, British pound sterling/U.S. dollar, Australian dollar/U.S. dollar, and
New Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar. Stress means short carry trades such as euro/
Japanese yen, British pound sterling/Japanese yen, British pound sterling/
Swiss franc, Australian dollar/Japanese yen, and New Zealand dollar/Japanese
yen. In nonrisk markets when EUROYEN TIBOR are acceptable, go long
euro/U.S. dollar, British pound sterling/U.S. dollar, Australian dollar/U.S.
dollar, and New Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar, and short U.S. dollar/Japanese
yen, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc, U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar, Australian dollar/
New Zealand dollar, euro/British pound sterling, and British pound sterling/
New Zealand dollar as market conditions dictate.
While market convention may suggest euro/Japanese yen is the premier
measure of risk, I suggest euro/Swiss franc as a better indicator for many
reasons. The fi rst is euro, Swiss franc, and U.S. dollar markets trade together
part of any trading day, while Japanese yen does not. The response from any
three markets will be felt immediately through euro/Swiss franc so strategy
can be factored much quicker. The question of euro/Japanese yen is how
will U.S. dollar react? Swiss franc will be seen much faster than a Japanese

yen response because Japanese yen responses to markets can at times be
slow. euro/Swiss franc can be classifi ed in this instance as a forward indica-
tor. It’s not only euro to measure risk but Swiss franc is the premier measure
of safety. euro/Swiss franc serves a more perfect balance because the euro is
more widely traded, as is Swiss franc, more so than Japanese yen. Further
euro/Swiss franc futures contracts trade in Europe, so a market response will
be felt much faster.
For U.S. and European markets, another method to measure risk directly
from money markets is the Overnight Indexed Swap (OIS)–Eurodollar
spread. This trade is essentially U.S. dollar/euro, but it could easily be euro/
U.S. dollar depending which way the spreads move. OIS represents U.S. OIS
and Eurodollars represent the euro. As OIS rates increase, Eurodollars will
fall and vice versa. The question is will OIS–Eurodollar rates translate fast
enough to be refl ected in the currency markets? The answer is yes, because sell
offs will occur simultaneously.
Seasonality and U.S. Dollar/Japanese Yen
Traditionally, the U.S. dollar/Japanese yen peaks during the year around April
or May along with LIBOR. The answer is believed to be due to Japanese
governments who pass and vote budgets during this time. The Ministry
of Finance in Japan writes initial budgets in December, adjusts the bud-
get in February due to supplementary requests by Japanese Ministries, and
a vote is held around the April/May period in the Japanese Diet (Ministry
of Finance2010). Japanese companies pass budgets in line with government
budgets for purposes of business planning and taxes. If U.S. dollar/Japanese
yen peaks, Japanese yen/U.S. dollar bottoms and allows Japanese yen to be
borrowed to fund the new year.
Canada
Canada’s overnight rate is termed the Overnight Money Market Financing
Rate (OMMFR), a rate determined as an estimate based on an end of day
survey by the Bank of Canada (BOC) banks. The OMMFR is a weighted
average of repo funding costs by money dealers (Reid 2007). It is a one-day
rate that measures the cost for securities dealers to fi nance their operations.
The Canadian Overnight Repo Rate is a weighted average of GC rates
of repo transactions between 6:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. and is employed to

==================================================

LIBOR 141
measure intraday and end-of-day levels of the OMMFR (Reid 2007). The
reason for using the OMMFR is it is not as volatile as the CORRA rate, plus
many more transactions occur in Canada’s interbank market (Reid 2007).
One would note from Exhibit 5.26, the chart comparison of the CORRA
and OMMFR, that not much volatility exists between the two rates but both
travel together. Ironically, 145 instances have occurred since 2005 where daily
Canadian dollar transactions reached below the $500-million threshold in
the repo market so CORRA was employed as the overnight rate (Reid 2007).
Notice Exhibit 5.27, the chart of U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar from 2009 to
2010 and notice the spike in CORRA and OMMFR.
The spike was caused by the June 1, 2010, hike in Canada’s target rate
from 0.25 to 0.50. This raised Canada’s borrowing costs and in turn raised

the Canadian dollar side of U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar pair. If future raises
occur, Canadian dollar will rise further in the U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar
combination. Further notice the downtrend from 2009 to 2010. This was
caused by rate decreases that began in 2007. U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar
has actually been in a long-term downtrend when rates began to descend.
To understand the relationship further, view Exhibit 5.28 of the Canadian
CORRA rate minus the target in basis points.
Seasonality and U.S. Dollar/Canadian Dollar
The Canadian Parliament normally votes and passes a government budget
during March/April. Fiscal years in Canada begin April 1, so normally a
budget is already in place from the traditional March introduction (Canada
Department of Finance 2010). Major Canadian companies also write their
own budgets in line with government budgets. Look for Canadian LIBOR
and the OMMFR to reach its peak of the year during this period and also
look for U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar to peak, Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar to
bottom.

Switzerland
The Swiss National Bank’s (SNB) overnight rate is termed SARON, Swiss
Average Rate Overnight, and is employed as the rate to achieve the BBA
Swiss franc LIBOR three-month target. It is a volume-weighted average and
is c alculated every 10 minutes with noon and 4:00 p.m. end-of-day Swiss
Fixing times (SIX Swiss Exchange). To ensure accuracy of the target, the
Swiss employ three more indicators to oversee SARON.
SCRON is the Swiss Current Rate Overnight and is employed to view
current interbank market trades. SCRON is calculated every three minutes
throughout any trading day by the SIX Swiss Exchange, the Swiss Stock
Market where these various rates trade.
SAION is the Swiss Average Index Overnight and SCION is the Swiss
Current Index Overnight. What determines these various rates is the impor-
tance of Swiss franc repo, since the SNB adds or subtracts liquidity based on
Swiss franc BBA LIBOR through Swiss franc repo. Repo rates hold domi-
nance in the SNB’s target, because liquidity is added or subtracted to support
repo trades, repo rates establish a fl oor for rates. The repo fl oor translates to a
Swiss franc/U.S. dollar fl oor, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc peak.



==================================================
                     PAGE 158                     
==================================================

144 Inside the Currency Market
The SNB likes to hold their three-month target in the middle of the
range to allow for any outside economic developments and prevent them
from sidetracking their target structure. SARON is the preferred indicator
because that is the rate that establishes and defi nes the all-important Swiss
yield curve. The Swiss economy is heavily monitored by these rates.
Seasonality and U.S. Dollar/Swiss Franc
The Federal Finance Administration prepares and submits a budget to the
Swiss Parliament to be voted on, usually by December. Swiss companies, like
their governmental counterparts, write their own budgets in line with Swiss
calendar years. Look for Swiss franc LIBOR and SARON rates to peak during
the December/January period. Yet U.S. dollar/Swiss franc will begin its ascent
and Swiss franc/U.S. dollar to bottom at that time.
Target Rates Defi ned
Monetary policy for Canada and most of the world’s economies are found in
the target for the overnight rate. That establishes borrow and lend rates, bid
and ask, buy and sell. Canada operates monetary policy based on an operating
band. The band is one half of a percentage point wide and the overnight is the
target. If the operating band is 2.25 to 2.75 percent, the overnight target (cid:2)2.50
percent. The top band is the top bank rate and establishes interest for one day.
The bottom band is the deposit rate and the rate banks pay on surplus funds.
The repo rate for Canada is important because it establishes the over-
night rate. The OMMFR is a mystery rate and will always remain that way.
The markets then decide if the overnight rate should be tied to the repo rate
or a market rate such as a T-bill.
Canadian borrowing costs are factored as
Interest (cid:4) (90/365)
Now convert to U.S. dollar for a Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar price.
Canada’s infl ation-control target is the midpoint of the control. The
operational guide is equal to core CPI. If the target is equal to 1 to 3 percent,
2 percent is the midpoint.

three-month target period, but they could easily serve for any central bank.
Total for the CPI falls perfectly within the middle of the range at 1.8 percent
for July 2010. Consumer prices defi ne infl ation.
If the target was 1 percent and the actual number was 3 percent, adjust-
ments in reserves would be implemented because the remaining fi gures
couldn’t support such a high erosion of prices and such an erosion of the cur-
rency. Stated differently, the amount of reserves targeted for the three-month
period cannot support prices in the 3 percent range. The purchasing power of
the Canadian dollar would erode. This is a buy Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar
and sell U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar situation and an easy, profi table trade
when an economic CPI release occurs.
Core CPI is a measure of prices minus food and energy. It defi nes further
the overall CPI target. More importantly, it is the defi ning factor to measure
monetary policy. The 1.6 percent core is perfect and correctly in line with
not only overall CPI but the overall 0.50 target. The caveat to this scenario
is the BOC raised its top rate from 0.25 to 0.50 in June 2010. So the 0.75
OMMFR is on the high side and would probably come down unless the
market is factoring another rate increase. This is a buy Canadian dollar/
U.S. dollar and sell U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar if an actual rate increase
occurs because BOC borrowing costs will be raised and the Canadian dollar
must be priced to refl ect that new rate. The next CPI report will determine
this answer.

If CPI is above target, chances are good a rate increase will occur and the
Canadian dollar will be refl ected in its price in terms of its new purchasing
power. The outline here is a potential trend situation for U.S. dollar/Canadian
dollar and a total outline of the implications of LIBOR and Canada’s OMMFR.
Further notice Exhibit 5.30, the infl ation curve for the U.S. dollar and
notice how infl ation is factored in terms of various rates. This again could
be a trend implication for the U.S. dollar if economic conditions warrant.
Yet it should be measured against U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar and Canadian
dollar/U.S. dollar.
The next question to consider is where do LIBOR and currency prices
go from here? The answer is rates fan out like a Fibonacci arc priced into
other fi nancial instruments such as swaps, forwards, stock markets, bonds,
and yields. A one-day rate is a one-day trade, but a one-day rate determines
direction for trends.
Conclusion
Now that monetary policy, short-term interest rates, and spot prices are estab-
lished, the next juncture is to price interest rates in terms of open-market
instruments. Deposit rates, the understanding of the fl oor, and the bid in
interest rates were established in this chapter. But that is only one side of the
currency pair equation. The next question is how far will rates travel and what
instruments to employ to gauge the spot price?

CHAPTER 6
Government Bonds,
Yields, Yield Curves,
and Currency Prices
A yield-curve chapter is imperative to understand a currency pair and its
price because a yield curve represents an interest rate priced to the market at
a specifi ed maturity. But one yield curve and one interest rate only prices one
side of a currency pair. A two-nation yield curve must be understood in order
to understand the other side of a currency pair. From a two-nation perspective,
a true currency-pair price can be factored and traded. How to denote trends
and ranges as it relates to yield curves will be fully highlighted as well as the
necessary formulas and conditions to trade currencies against the U.S. dollar.
Cross pairs should only be traded under certain circumstances, and they will
be equally highlighted. The other side of a yield is a sovereign bond, and
bonds must be understood in terms of not just their yields but under what
circumstances currency pairs can be traded against a bond. Many examples
are offered to ensure a full understanding of how to trade currency pairs
against yield curves. The chapter surveys each nation and highlights its yield
curve, bond prices, and movements, with operation explanations provided.
Yield Curves
After LIBOR and daily internal nation rates are released, curves are plotted such
as LIBOR curves, bond-yield curves, treasury-yield curves, swap curves, and
forward curves. Each nation will have a different yield curve to represent the
disparity of interest rates, yet all curves for the most part are represented by
the offi cial government bond-yield curve.

148 Inside the Currency Market
A yield curve is called the term structure of interest rates because it fore-
casts interest rates, affi rms present market rates, infl ation, and expected infl a-
tion. Lending and borrowing, investments, trading, and fi nancing all are traded
along the curve. The shape of the curve and the price of yields will determine
where activity will be traded. For example, if the long end of the yield curve
crosses below the shorter end, this predicts recession because yields will be out
of sync on the long end. Recognizing this, market professionals will act accord-
ingly for down economic times ahead. If a yield curve is perfectly sloped where
all yields fall into a smooth trend line up from the short to the long end, market
professionals will again act accordingly based on good times ahead.
Yield curves have predictive powers. Market professionals will look at U.S.
three-month Treasuries against the two-year note to determine direction of yields
while others will look at the two-year against the 10-year note to determine
longer-term direction. Still others will view the 10-year against the 30-year note.
But all will look at the entire slope of the curve in its entirety in basis-point terms
to determine how slopes and shapes align to determine changing economic activ-
ity. Flattened curves at the long end could mean economic trouble ahead, while
humps in the middle of a curve could be derived from an economic shock.
Central banks and economists determine and predict economic activity by
the slope, price of yields, and spreads between maturities. For example, Haubrich
and Bianco at the Cleveland Federal Reserve determine Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) based on the difference of spreads between the three-month treasury,
10-year note, and slope of the curve in basis points. Slopes are measured as the
difference between long- and short-term yields measured in percents. Predictions
were perfectly on target. Others employ yield curves to predict Consumer Price
Index (CPI) and interest rates. Infl ation can be found in any nation’s yield curve
by subtracting the 10 year from the 3 month domestic interest rate, Bank Bills in
Australia and New Zealand, EONIA swap index in Europe, BBA LIBOR minus
SONIA in the UK. The determination is the difference between nominal and real
yields where nominal yields are unadjusted for infl ation while real yields relates
a true rate of return in relation to taxes as just one example of unadustments.
Still others use yield curves between nations to determine economic direction
between nations. Spot prices can be viewed from two nations’ yield curves. Three
variations occur. Yield curves can either widen, narrow, or remain fl at based on
the yield spreads, and all have important implications for the spot trade.
The U.S. example says that as yields fall, yield curves steepen or widen;
when yields rise yield curves fl atten.
Currency Trading and Yield Curves
Currency traders determine trades based on yield curves between two nations.
This historic development apparently began in 2007 with Arnaud Mehl in

Open Economies Journal when he looked at the yield curve as a predictor of
industrial production and infl ation in emerging market economies based on
the euro and U.S. yield curve. Building on decades and piles of previous
research, Mehl found prediction factors compelling. Mehl’s fi ndings allowed
nation-to-nation research to continue into yield curve comparisons, and this
phenomenon gave currency traders an opportunity to trade the curve and
trade various comparisons of the curve slope. Further, Mehl’s research allowed
deeper comprehension of yield-curve slopes. As euro and U.S. yield curves
predicted infl ation and industrial production in emerging-market economies,
so can emerging-market economies predict infl ation in the United States and
the euro zone. Traders began to measure slopes in percents in relation to
Regression using R2.
Market professionals factored this phenomenon and used it to their
trading advantage. From Mehl, Exhibit 6.1 is an historic comparison of the
downward slope of yield curves between South Africa and Taiwan. Notice
Exhibit 6.2 and the downslope of the U.S. and upslope of the euro yield
curve. The measure is gold as the best predictor of infl ation. Gold is fi xed twice
daily by the London Bullion Market Association at 10:30 a.m. and 3:00 p.m.
London time, 5:30 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. New York time for the U.S. dollar,
euro, and British pound. This means gold is priced in euros, British pounds
and U.S. dollars, and each has a different price due to different economies
and different infl ation rates. A gold trade is measured by the price of gold
between and among each currency.
In Exhibit 6.3, view the historic chart of the same period of Gold/U.S.
dollar. Predictions were forecasted about gold’s rise to yields between the
United States and South Africa. The fi nal analysis is that Mehl may be on
track in his infl ation prediction, as gold is the best measure of infl ation.
For currency traders, what if one nation’s short-end yields were rising
and another falling, or what if one nation’s long-end yields were falling and
another nation’s long-end yields were rising? These are perfect trades and occur
all the time. The best determination is to know each nation’s yield curve in its

entirety for all maturities to determine where to profi t. A yield curve can be
drawn by a list of yields on the left and maturities listed on the bottom. Then
plot the yields and measure slopes.
The best determination is to view the slope, yields, and where on the
curve is the majority of activity. The spread between yields is the most impor-
tant aspect to determine slope and curves. Take, for example, a two-year
comparison of any nation’s yield curve and divide the yields to determine a
spread. What occurs is spreads ebb and fl ow over time to refl ect the different
prices between maturities. Each maturity is attached to a price, and that price
is factored into the markets. The question for any trader must be which side

of the currency pair is expensive and which side is less expensive in terms of
the yield. It is the price of money in the traded markets. The less expensive
side of a pair will be bought and the expensive side sold. Trends are denoted
by following slopes to yields.
Notice Exhibit 6.4, the U.S. Treasury Yield Curve chart from February
2010 to June 2010, and notice the difference from month to month of how
yields in various maturities rise and fall. This represents profi ts for currency
and other traders of various instruments.
What to surmise is where is a mismatch of rates and how is profi t earned?
Suppose LIBOR rates were expensive in U.S. dollars one day but cheap in
British sterling. Would it make sense to swap U.S. dollars for British sterling
to either profi t or arrange fi nancing for business conducted in Great Britain?
Would it further make sense to buy British pound/U.S. dollar? Yet curves
have three junctures: long, middle, and short. Where a rate may fall on the
long, middle, or short end would better determine how to arrange strategic
investments and trades. After a brief historic walk, we will look at the rela-
tionship between government bonds, yields, and currency prices.
Historically, yield curves are not a new phenomenon. With the introduc-
tion of LIBOR in the late 1980s, research was under way to factor LIBOR
against bond yields. The swap market’s introduction in the late 1990s intro-
duced a new point along the curve that had to be factored. All central banks
adopted various yield-curve methodologies to account for this new pheno-
menon. The rise of the forward market was the last factor that added still
another point along the curve. By the late 1990s, an abundance of literature
already existed in many forms regarding the yield curve.
Throughout the early 2000s, yield-curve literature grew again that added
newer methodologies to the 1990s research. One factor that changed yield curves
for many nations during this period was the introduction of the euro. Yield curves
had to synchronize to euro bond trading, so accrued interest as well as yield-
curve calculations were refactored. All nations engaged in this new methodology.
Today, so many variations, computations, methodologies, and factors of the yield
curve exist they are too numerous to list here. Yet so many similarities now exist
nation to nation due to bond-issuance terms that are similar nation to nation in
maturities and coupon payments. It actually helped to understand currency pairs
and movements in a clearer light and took away the market guesses.
Central banks and market professionals began to look at the yield curve
with its abundance of factors represented either as a rate of return or a mea-
sure of risk. A yield is factored in the United States by dividing the coupon
payment by the bond price, and a coupon payment is divided by yield to
equal a price. Most bonds in many nations offer semi-annual payments. This
had to be factored according to the new yield curve.

Government Bonds, Yields, Yield Curves, and Currency Prices 153
Index-linked bonds vastly changed yield-curve calculations. By the early
2000s, all nations offered some type of bond indexed mostly to infl ation,
except for the Bank of England (BOE), which indexed to retail prices.
The real reason to follow yield curves is due to their changing nature
on a daily basis. Short-term interest rates are tied to bond prices and bond
prices are tied to spot-currency prices. And all factor into a yield curve.
This requires a regular calculation to determine changes to slopes, yields, and
bond prices to yields. But the short end was much easier for computation
and investment purposes due to the many instruments offered. Longer-term
bonds required an iteration, an estimate of price compared to yield. It is an
assumption, a best-guess scenario. This is why market professionals obtain
daily bond closing prices and draw a new curve every day.
One would recognize from the Bank of International Settlements (BIS)
Triennial Surveys in Chapter 1 the historic rise in the swap and forward mar-
kets from 2000 and beyond. Yield-curve methodologies allowed for the rise
of both instruments. A few examples of the most popular employed by cen-
tral banks follow.
Central Banks and Yield Curves
The U.S. Treasury employs a “Quasi Cubic Hermite Spline function”, a
calculation the Treasury doesn’t make public. Yet the St Louis Federal Reserve
provides a few clear examples. Because the Treasury releases daily yield rates,
many hedge funds, bank research departments, and trading fi rms approxi-
mate almost an exact Treasury Yield Curve.
The Japanese employ a type of Gaussian Affi ne rate-term structure for their
yield curve’s predictive powers. From mathematics, Carl Friedrich Gauss gave
the world in 1809 the normal distribution with a probability function—the
Gaussian approach to mathematics called standard deviation. The difference
between the Japanese and other central banks and market professionals is the
Japanese always employ any calculations to determine an error term, a measure
to determine risk. The normal distribution was also termed the Law of Errors,
so the Japanese follow Gauss to his last calculation. This is traditional Japanese
methodology, yet a method employed by only a few central banks.
The Bank of England is forthright in its yield-curve calculations and
methodologies in every aspect, rare for a central bank. A special department
called Yield Curves exists within the Bank of England. The BOE employs a
version of the Cubic Spline model to calculate its yield curves. The ECB pub-
lishes an actual spot-rate yield curve, instantaneous forwards, and par yields

along with maturities from three-months to 30-year bonds. The ECB yield
curve is published every trading day, with an interactive device offered for
comparison of slopes and shapes among the various maturities.
Bonds and Yields
The bond interplay has two sides, the bond price and the bond yield. Both
have an inverse relationship. As bond prices rise, yields decrease and vice
versa. This scenario factors for all government bonds. The choice of which
side is the best investment angle depends not only on the day’s LIBOR but
the trend in LIBOR in terms of the three-month target.
A yield investment is a risk trade while the bond purchase is the safe trade
due to backing by government revenues. What drives either side of the bond/
yield interplay is interest rates, and what drives interest rates is economic condi-
tions short and long term. In market terms, it is bond cash fl ows that determine
a currency-pair price in nations whose bonds are tied to economic performance.
Market professionals’ interest lies in yields because yields are the focus
for central banks due to focus on their own yield curves as a measure of
risk in both target and infl ation. Yield curves measured against maturities
and yields determine for central banks how to better manage their reserves.
Central banks release daily tables of yields for maturities of their bonds. For
currency pairs, each pair follows a different side of the bond/yield interplay.
In U.S. markets, the euro/U.S. dollar, British pound/U.S. dollar,
Australian dollar/U.S. dollar, and New Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar follow
yields while U.S. dollar/Swiss franc, U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar, and U.S.
dollar/Japanese yen follow the safety of the bond price. For currency cross
pairs, U.S. dollar cross pairs follow bond prices and opposing U.S. dollar
cross pairs follow yields. Yet this scenario is not perfect, as will be seen.
In European markets, the scenario works quite differently. The British
pound/U.S. dollar follows the safety of its own bond price and actually despises
yields while euro/U.S. dollar is attached to yields. The reason for this is bor-
rowing costs and an easier relationship to manage between the euro and British
pound. Any two-nation relationship, for the most part, follows a bond/yield
relationship. What if yield spreads widen between British pound gilts and
German bunds in European trading? Higher borrowing costs will force the
British pound into a sell position, as the British pound must refl ect higher costs.
It is a different scenario for Australian dollar/U.S. dollar and New
Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar and far from the norm. Both abhor yields in their
own markets and rely on the bond price. Higher yields force both pairs into
a sell position in their respective markets.

Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, and U.S. dollar/
Swiss franc follow the same principles. All love U.S. bond prices. A few exam-
ples will clarify this explanation.
Euro/U.S. Dollar and U.S. Treasury Bond Yields
Notice Exhibit 6.5, the chart of the three-month Treasury Bill and two-year
Treasury Note along with spreads of each, and further notice Exhibit 6.6, the
historic euro/U.S. dollar chart marked exactly as the Treasury chart.
From 2000 to 2002, yields for both were down but so were the spreads and
the euro/U.S. dollar hardly moved. Yet notice the almost 7 percent yield pay-
out for the two-year note and three-month bill. This explains the no-movement
aspect. The payout is too expensive for the short end of this curve, especially if
present interest rates and reserve requirements aren’t in sync to the 7 percent yield.
From 2002 to 2003, yields and spreads were down and the euro/U.S.
dollar began its ascent. From 2003 to 2006, yields were up, spreads were down
and the euro/U.S. dollar trended. In 2007 to 2008, the euro/U.S. dollar
followed the yields of both, but the spreads rose as well. This set the euro/U.S.
dollar up for the 2008 to 2009 fall. Notice further how the spreads leveled
and caused uncertainty of direction.
The perfect scenario to trade the three-month Bill against the two-year note
occurs when yields are low and trending up and spreads between both decrease,
such as the 2003 to 2006 example. For the euro/U.S. dollar, this represents a
trend on autopilot. A leveling of spreads says indecision and market uncertainty.
Notice the low present yield of both Treasury instruments and leveled spreads.
Market uncertainty says either a small trend will occur or yields and spreads will
remain low over time due to economic conditions and the uncertainty of future
rates. Present economic conditions do not give a reason for the euro/U.S. dollar
to move. This is a no-trade condition. Yet here is the point to now look at the
middle or long end of the curve for directional guidance.
British Pound/U.S. Dollar and Bond Yields
Notice Exhibit 6.7, the monthly chart of the British pound/U.S. dollar and notice
the exact directional movements to the euro/U.S. dollar. The difference is the
British pound/U.S. dollar moved farther and faster up, yet its fall was greater. This
is typical of this relationship, as the British pound/U.S. dollar always has and prob-
ably always will out pace the euro/U.S. dollar in up trends and down trends. Why?
Recall repurchase agreements and the mention of the corridor of rates. The
euro is locked into a EURIBOR, EONIA, EURONIA, deposit rate, Minimum

The euro/U.S. dollar must be priced between or against this corridor while the
British pound/U.S. dollar is not locked into such a series of rates and is allowed
a freer movement in the markets. Yet the exact same scenario holds for this pair
as the euro/U.S. dollar. It is a no-trade condition until the economic situation
changes or the middle or longer end of the curve can reveal direction. In this
instance, it is the Treasury curve that may provide U.S. market information.
U.S. Dollar/Swiss Franc, U.S. Dollar/Canadian Dollar,
U.S. Dollar/Japanese Yen and Bond Yields
The opposite scenario holds for the U.S. dollar/Swiss franc and U.S.
dollar/Canadian dollar as both follow not yields but the actual bond
price. When U.S. bond prices rise, both pairs rise and vice versa. See
Exhibits 6.10 and 6.11.

160 Inside the Currency Market
In this instance, as the British pound/U.S. dollar and euro/U.S. dollar
trended up between 2003 and 2006, U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar and U.S.
dollar/Swiss franc trended down to follow the bond price and Treasury Bill.
The difference was more pronounced for U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar than it
was for U.S. dollar/Swiss franc. This difference lies between the two econo-
mies, as the Swiss economy is more controlled, more guarded by a series of
locked rates like the euro, while the Canadian economic system is less con-
trolled and allows for U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar to move more freely. No
two pairs will ever move in exact pips because no two economies are the same.
What separates economies are reserve requirements, interest rates,
target rates, LIBOR, bond prices, growth targets, rate channels, and the
methodology to measure each. Some central banks heavily control and
monitor economies, others do not. U.S. dollar/Japanese yen movements
are refl ective of U.S. dollar/Swiss franc and U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar,
exact movements, exact times of movements, and varying amounts of pips.
U.S. dollar/Japanese yen is not a controlled currency by the Japanese gov-
ernment or locked into various rate channels. Instead, other market instru-
ments hold the U.S. dollar/Japanese yen pair from movement, and this will
be addressed in future chapters.
Carry Trades and Bond Yields
See Exhibit 6.12, the chart of euro/Japanese yen from 2003 to 2006. What
is evident is that within a three-year period, euro/Japanese yen moved about
2000 pips. This refl ects not only a stable economic environment that is con-
ducive for carry trades to earn its yield, but carry trades won’t have the same
volatile movements as the euro/U.S. dollar and opposite dollar pairs.
Carry trades follow the underlying pairs rather than the straight con-
nection to bonds and yields. That connection of movements can only refl ect
in economic conditions and interest rates. Stable economic environments
bring with it slow but certain trends for carry trades. Uncertain or erratic
economic conditions and interest rates bring market volatility. Volatility
is refl ective of a market out of sync and not normal because direction is
uncertain. Employed correctly and in certain economic times, carry trades
can be not only a perfect investment vehicle but a profi table investment.
All cross pairs acted the same as euro/Japanese yen whether it be British
pound/Japanese yen, British pound/Swiss franc, euro/British pound, or
British pound/New Zealand dollar. Between 2003 and 2006, volatility was
low and trends progressed.

U.S. Treasury Yield Curves and 2- and 10-Year Notes
Yield curves can be viewed in their entirety to observe trades. See Exhibit 6.13,
the four-month chart of the Treasury yield curve shown earlier in the chapter,
and notice the difference between the two- and 10-year bond yields. Notice
Exhibit 6.14, a monthly chart of British pound/U.S. dollar. As spreads between
the two- and 10-year yields widened from February to March, the euro/U.S.
dollar and British pound/U.S. dollar trended down. March to April saw a
compression of spreads and a rally occurred. April to May witnessed long-end,
10-year, and two-year yields retreat that again caused a trend down. May to June
witnessed another compression of spreads at the two-year and higher yields at
the 10-year plateau that caused a trend up for the British pound/U.S. dollar
and euro/U.S. dollar. It is the compression of spreads that lends confi dence and is
paramount to any higher yield strategy.
The question to employ spread and yield methods is why should a pair
be bought or sold. A currency pair won’t move unless a reason exists for it to
move. A currency pair must have value in terms of yields and bond prices or

a mismatch of both in order for traders and the market to force movements
and profi t. Yet a currency pair must be priced correctly in terms of yields and
spreads. How much is always questionable because so many factors of yields,
bonds, and economic conditions exist in this equation. Many times spot prices
can be ahead or behind a yield play. Examples of this will be in future chapters.
Yet others may anticipate movements such as the present euro/U.S.
dollar example of the three-month and two-year bond. It is evident that
the euro/U.S. dollar will move, as both the three-month and two-year note
yields are low as well as the spreads. But where will it move and is it worth the
risk? In terms of the yield curve, any shape can materialize that would change
quickly any anticipation of a price move such as inversion of the curve or a
fl attening or steepening at the short or long end. Yet any shape can occur
between two yield curves. To gauge any movements, look at each currency
pair in relation to its exact counterpart as well as its exact opposite.
U.S. Dollar/Swiss Franc, U.S. Dollar/Japanese
Yen, and U.S. Dollar/Canadian Dollar
Evident within the U.S. dollar/Swiss franc and U.S. dollar/Japanese yen charts
is the opposite movements to the euro/U.S. dollar and British pound/U.S.

dollar caused by the movement of bond prices rather than yields, the safe
trade. Opposite to the euro/U.S. dollar and British pound/U.S. dollar com-
pression of spreads with higher yields is U.S. dollar/Swiss franc and U.S.
dollar/Japanese yen that react more confi dently when spreads widen and
yields head lower. This distills confi dence of movement and secures trends.
How much each pair moves in relation to each other can only be guessed
based on the above factors. An example will follow.
Notice U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar and notice the disjointed moves.
This raises two factors for consideration. Canada raised its top rate in June
2010. One can say the market was undergoing a repricing in anticipation of
the hike. In this instance, Canadian bond yields would far surpass U.S. yields
and cause the disjointed movement. The gauge for this bond/yield strategy
focused on the U.S. market and U.S. bonds and yields.
A rate hike in Canada raises Canadian borrowing costs. This sends
LIBOR, CORRA, and OMMFR higher, and in turn Canadian yields also
move higher. Canada’s economic situation took precedence. This is obvious,
as a nation will always defend its currency and economic system above others.
But it is a market-pricing factor in terms of the pair rather than a defense of
a currency in this instance.
Amongst the three pairs, the yield strategy is buy U.S. dollar against Swiss
franc, Japanese yen, and Canadian dollar. U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar reacted
as sell Canadian dollar against U.S. dollar. Under normal circumstances, U.S.
dollar/Canadian dollar’s movements would have refl ected exactly as U.S. dollar/
Swiss franc and U.S. dollar/Japanese yen.
Secondly, U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar is never a sure bet. For the most
part, U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar can be trusted, other times it cannot. This is
typical for this pair, as the relationship to U.S. dollar is a yield/yield. The nick-
name for the Canadian dollar is the Loonie, and it lives up to its reputation
at times, simply because of its funny movements due to its yield relationship
between the United States and its own market. U.S. dollar/Swiss franc and
U.S. dollar/Japanese yen are better gauges against each other and against its
counterparts and between the two, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc is the best gauge.
Canada Yield Curve and Bond Issuance
Canada issues Canadian Treasury bills every two weeks with maturities of
three and six months and one year. The terms to maturities are 98 days, 168
days, 182 days, 350 days, and 364 days. T-Bills are priced at a discount and
have been issued in book-entry form since 2008 (Bank of Canada). Canadian

tradeable bonds include maturities of two years, three years, fi ve years, seven
years, 10 years, and 30 years.
Maturities of two-, fi ve-, 10-, and 30-year Government of Canada bond
futures contracts trade on the Montreal Exchange, Canada’s premier futures
and options exchange. The two-year bond contract is termed the CGZ, the
fi ve-year is the CGF, the 10-year is the CGB, and the 30-year is the LGB.
Direct bond trading is conducted through Candeal, Canada’s premier online
debt-trading network.
Canada issues foreign currency bonds termed Canada Notes and Canada
Bills. Canada Bills are promissory notes denominated in U.S. dollars that are
issued in book-entry form with a maturity of 270 days (BOC).
Canada Notes are promissory notes denominated in U.S. dollars and
issued in book-entry form. Denominations of $1000 accompany maturities
of nine months or longer with a fi xed or fl oating coupon. Principal and inter-
est is paid in U.S. dollars (BOC). Canada also issues Indexed Bonds called
real Return Bonds with various maturities and indexed to Canada’s CPI.
Calculate Canada Bonds and Yields
Treasury Bills are calculated as simple interest using actual/365. The price per
$100 par value of a T-Bill yielding Y calculates as:
p (cid:3) 100/(1 (cid:5) Y (cid:4) T/365)
Yield (cid:3) (365/T) (100 – p)/p)
Short Canada bond—sum of the quoted price plus accrued interest paid
on actual/365 basis. Interest accrues at the rate of 1/365th of annual coupon
rate per day. Accrued interest for a bond that pays interest semiannually at an
annual rate of C as a percent of par is calculated as:
A (cid:3) C (D/365)
where
D (cid:3) number of days to settlement date.
For a Canada bond with one coupon remaining, the price of a bond with
T days remaining to maturity to yield y,

Yield Curve and U.S. Dollar/Canadian Dollar
The U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar relationship in U.S. markets is supposed
to factor as the Canadian dollar is the U.S. Treasury Bond follower, while
the U.S. dollar is the Canadian Bond yield seeker in Canadian markets.
Sometimes this relationship holds for Canadian dollar, sometimes not. The
BOC’s interest lies in Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar. This relationship is quite
different and it leaves the Canadian dollar in a particular place. This is why
the Canadian dollar can be a tricky trading vehicle in U.S. markets and this
is also why it is known in market terms as the Loonie.
Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar allows the Canadian dollar to weaken and
rise at the expense of the U.S. dollar. Yet the pair accepted for trading pur-
poses the world over is the standard U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar confi gura-
tion. For U.S. market trading, it is imperative to evaluate this relationship
before a trade is implemented. The methodology to do this lies in the short
end of the Treasury and Canadian yield curves, as both are abundant with
short maturities. The question within this relationship is how much are bor-
rowing costs for the Canadian Government, business interests, and investors.
The answer will provide U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar direction and which
side of the pair to trade.
Australian Dollar/U.S. Dollar and New Zealand
Dollar/U.S. Dollar
Both pairs are unique and not highlighted due to their interest rate disparity
between all industrialized nations. Yet both pairs follow the exact patterns
as the euro/U.S. dollar and British pound/U.S. dollar. When U.S. Treasury
yields go up, Australian dollar/U.S. dollar and New Zealand dollar/U.S.
dollar will also travel up. Australian dollar/U.S. dollar will always outpace
New Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar on the way up due to higher paying interest,

but neither will outpace the British pound/U.S. dollar due to interest in trade
of the British pound/U.S. dollar.
British Pound Yield Curve
Notice Exhibit 6.15, the yield-curve chart of British gilt bonds. This is from
the three month to two year, and further notice the earlier two- and 10-year

notice the difference in yields.
Notice Exhibit 6.16, gilt yields from 2005 to 2010 and notice Exhibit 6.17,

tions between the United States and United Kingdom, it is a buy British

50-year gilts as opposed to the U.S. 30 year and the Japanese 40 year. This
changes the long end of the curve for all three and should be monitored.
View the British pound yield curve as a complete opposite scenario to
the United States.
Gilt Issuance
Two types of gilts are issued by the Debt Management Offi ce in Great
Britain—conventional and index-linked gilts. Conventional gilts refl ect
the liability of the U.K. government, while index-linked gilts refl ect the bor-
rowing rate of the government. Therefore, Index-Linked gilts have smaller
variations in yields.
The linked variation refl ects coupon and principal payment links to the
United Kingdom’s Retail Price Index. Beginning in 2011, the Retail Price
Index was supposed to change to a CPI link. This at least has been the pre-
vailing proposal, but the House of Commons has yet to address this issue
directly. Plus the DMO must reprice past and future issuances, which will
take time. The real purpose for issuance of Index-Linked gilts is coverage of
various pension liabilities. Both indices are reported in yields and maturities
by FTSE, an index company.
The DMO issues sterling Treasury Bills once a week. One-month or 28-day
Bills, three-month or 91-day Bills, and six-month or 182-day Bills are whole-
sale money-market instruments that trade in lots of 500,000 pounds sterling.
This structure ensures the importance of the short end of the British pound
yield curve and can provide vital direction to the British pound/U.S. dollar.
British Pound/U.S. Dollar
In U.S. markets, British pound is the yield seeker against Treasury Bonds
and the U.S. dollar is the bond follower. In London trading, U.S. dollar is
the yield seeker to British gilts and the British pound is the gilt bond fol-
lower. In European trading, U.S. dollar is again the yield seeker to German
Bonds while British pound holds a static position. That static position is
derived from London and German stock market trading that overlaps from
the open to close. Yet the latter part of European and London trading rolls
into U.S. trading. The British pound will always take precedence in U.S.
markets because it must seek its yield, and no better market exists where yield
can be earned. As we view trading strategies in later chapters, we will see the
exact positions of the U.S. dollar, as these positions don’t always hold.

Government Bonds, Yields, Yield Curves, and Currency Prices 171
Japanese Yield Curves
For the Japanese Central Bank and Government, the focus is the benchmark
10-year bond, called the Japanese Government Bond (JGB). Why this is so
can only be surmised. Consider the fi rst-ever futures contract traded on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) was the 10-year JGB bond in 1985 (Tokyo
Stock Exchange 2010).
As time progressed, a mini 10-year futures contract that was one tenth
the size of a regular JGB 10-year contract began trading. The TSE offered
an option contract on the JGB fi ve-year bond in 2000, but stopped in 2002
when no interest in the contract materialized (Tokyo Stock Exchange 2010).
Consider further that 63.9 percent of all JGBs are owned by Japanese
banks and insurance companies, 0.3 percent are owned by the BOJ, and 4.6
percent are owned by foreigners (Ministry of Finance 2010). The Japanese
do not provide an actively traded bond market in JGBs. JGBs are issued and
bought by insiders such as banks and insurance companies, premier compa-
nies in Japan. Instead, the only measure for JGBs is the futures contract.
Interest in the 10-year JGB is due to the 10-year JGB as an infl ation-
indexed bond where the principal fl uctuates with Japan’s CPI. It is essentially
a fl oating-rate bond and the only one of its type employed in Japan and
traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The Japanese issue a 15-year Floating
Rate JGB but it is not tied to infl ation. Both refl ect a difference of trade.

10-year bond and the 10-year infl ation-indexed bond. Refer to Exhibit 6.19,
the 10-year JGB difference in yields.
Japanese Yield Curve and U.S. Dollar/Japanese Yen
There are two factors for consideration regarding the Japanese yield curve
and the U.S. dollar/Japanese yen. The Japanese issue 40-year JGBs. This time
frame is longer than the United States, which issues 30-year Treasuries at the
longest end of their curve. This must be factored in any long-term U.S. dollar/
Japanese yen investment strategy.
Secondly, the Japanese Ministry of Finance just issued, for the fi rst time,
in July 2010 a three-year fi xed-rate bond. Sales and longevity of this issue
is anyone’s guess at this stage, but what this does to the short end of the
Japanese/ U.S. curve is interesting. Refer to Exhibit 6.20, the chart from
the September 1 and 2, 2010, auction of JGBs and notice the difference between
interest rates from the one-year to the 40-year bond between auction days.
Further notice the inclusion of the three-year maturity.
Prior to the one-year JGB maturity, the Japanese issue Treasury Discount
Bills with maturities of three and six months. The vast majority of all trading
along the curve will occur at the short end of the Japanese yield curve simply
because interest rates are 0.10 and not expected to rise to any prominence
and because the Japanese are always concerned with issues of liquidity, as is
evident in Ministry of Finance reports.

For example, the Japanese have a 48 percent bond dependency ratio
to match 2010 liquidity needs. For these reasons, the three- and six-month
Treasury Bill should always be compared to the two-year and 10-year Infl ation
Indexed JGB in order to derive a U.S. dollar/Japanese yen trading plan.
The reason is that shaky economies must be measured in terms of longer-
term trades due to risk.
Suppose growth and infl ation occurs in Japan and interest rates rise.
Where will the majority of trades occur and where will early warnings occur?
Predominantly at the short end of the yield curve. Why? This is the confi -
dence interval. Stated succinctly, with a high bond-dependency ratio who
would buy the long bond and who would tie up money for 40 years on an
unknown interest rate in an unknown economic situation?
The Samurai Bond is not an issuance of the Ministry of Finance, but
should be viewed in the bond and yield-curve context. The Samurai Bond is
yen denominated, issued in Japan by non-Japanese companies, with maturi-
ties that range from one to 30 years and used for investment purposes inside
Japan. Central bank reports would call this phenomenon foreign direct
investment. It is a measure of non Japanese companies’ confi dence in Japan’s
economy, because those investments are long term.
U.S. Dollar/Japanese Yen, Bonds, and Yields
The most interesting pair is the U.S. dollar/Japanese yen. In U.S. markets,
the arrangement is supposed to work as the Japanese yen is the Treasury-bond
price follower and the U.S. dollar is the JGB yield seeker in Japanese trading.
This correlation doesn’t always hold on the Japanese yen side. Remember
interested pairs for the BOJ in terms of their TWI. That arrangement was
Japanese yen/U.S. dollar. This arrangement changes the bond/yield correla-
tion in U.S. trading.
Japanese yen/U.S. dollar allows the U.S. dollar to be the bond-price
follower and the Japanese yen to be the yield seeker. In this manner, the

174 Inside the Currency Market
Japanese earn yen in terms of yield against the U.S. dollar, especially as
the Japanese yen/U.S. dollar price rises. Japanese yen/U.S. dollar should
always be the focus in U.S. trading, as the Japanese not only need this arrange-
ment to earn yen against Treasury Bond yields but U.S. dollar/Japanese yen as a
combination for U.S. trade would defeat the purpose of this arrangement as a
pair on Japanese terms. It is a very mixed arrangement, but an arrangement
instituted long ago with the introduction of the yen as a currency accepted by
all nations and markets. The true conundrum of the Japanese yen is it is well
connected to the U.S. Treasury bond.
The mixed aspect came into focus as the Japanese mix and match both
currency-pair arrangements as it satisfi es their needs. Yet both pairs should be
carefully evaluated before a trading plan is implemented. The questions for
consideration should always be what is in the interest of the Japanese central
bank and how can they profi t? In Japanese markets, Japanese yen/U.S. dollar
must be the arrangement. This is constructed by convention, and the
Japanese are almost forced into this arrangement. A closer look in later chapters
will fully outline trading arrangements, as sometimes this outlines only one
side of the currency-pair equation.
Australia Yield Curve
The Australia Offi ce of Financial Management offers a Treasury Bond, a
Treasury Indexed Bond, and a short-term Treasury Note. The proper term
for all is Commonwealth Government securities.
Short-term notes are issued only to meet liquidity needs of Australia’s
Government but are not issued routinely. Treasury Bonds are issued for the
medium to long term with fi xed interest every Wednesday and Friday.
Treasury Indexed Bonds are issued with capital that adjusts to Australia’s
CPI Index. Payments are made quarterly based on a fi xed rate, with tenders
that occur every Tuesday.
The best method to gauge Australia’s yield curve for Australian dollar/
U.S. dollar trades is to watch the three- and 10-year bond futures contracts
that trade on the ASX. This is also the indicator watched by the Offi ce of
Financial Management and is highlighted in Royal Bank of Australia (RBA)
reports routinely. The RBA publishes a daily yield curve for Australia’s debt
instruments.
The Australian economy has far outperformed the vast majority of all
industrialized economies, so its present debt-issuance schedule is able to easily

meet the fi nance needs of the Australian economy. Consider Australia’s top
present OCR rate is 4.50 percent, so bonds issued further out along the yield
curve pay far more than 4.50 percent. Australia debt management is just not a
problem presently. With an OCR at 4.50 percent, it is a buy-the-dip strategy
for Australian dollar/U.S. dollar.

Australian Dollar/U.S. Dollar and Australia Yield Curves
This pair has opposing confi gurations, therefore as Australian dollar/U.S.
dollar rises along with U.S. bond yields, it drops as Australia’s bonds fall. In
this instance, Australian dollar is tied to U.S. yields during U.S. market trad-
ing and the U.S. dollar is tied to Australia’s bond yield during Australia trading.
For further confi rmation, one only has to look at LIBOR or Bank Bills. We fol-
low yields in the United States and bond prices in Australia for direction and
continuity as Australia trading ends and trade shifts to the next market. What
to look for in yield curves is a widening and narrowing of spreads.

On-the-Run Note. The contract price is determined as “the difference
between forward rates of each asset” (ASX).
The spread is the “quoted price of the ASX 10-year bond futures contract
yield minus the forward yield for the On-the-Run Treasury” (ASX). A widening
of spreads denotes Australia bond yields are up and Treasury yields are down,
while a narrowing of spreads denotes Australia yields decreasing as Treasury
yields increase. The price of the contract is denominated in Australian dollars.
“The price of the contract began as 1000 Aussie dollars plus the yield differen-
tial in basis points to allow for negative spreads to be traded and quoted” (ASX).
Interest-rate futures are priced based on yield to maturity, so contracts
trade on the basis of yield. Prices are quoted based as 100 minus yield to
maturity. Because contracts trade based on a fi xed-tick system, longer-term
bonds may be a measure to gauge economic conditions. Fixed-tick values
decrease as interest rates rise and increase as interest rates fall. For the 30-day
ASX interbank cash-rate futures, multiply price movements by fi xed-tick
dollar value of Australian dollar—24.66 per 0.01 move by number of con-
tracts. An interest-rate measure is the ASX Target Rate Tracker based on the
30-day contract, and can be monitored on the ASX web site (ASX).
New Zealand
New Zealand yield curves are fairly simple, as this is another economy that cur-
rently outperforms all industrialized economies. New Zealand’s current OCR
is 2.75 percent, so debt issuance is not a problem to fund New Zealand’s econ-
omy, nor are buyers for New Zealand’s debt. New Zealand’s debt-to-GDP ratio
is currently 23.1 percent. In comparative European terms, 23.1 percent is low.
New Zealand’s Debt Management Offi ce currently issues three-month,
six-month, and one-year Treasury Bills weekly (NZDMO). The one-year
Treasury issuance began in April 2010.
Kiwi Bonds denominated in New Zealand dollars are offered to domiciled
residents in denominations of six-month, one-year, and two-year maturities.
The two-year Kiwi bond pays 3.75 as of August 2010. Remaining bond issu-
ance has maturities of 3, 5, 7 and 10 years.
Kauri Bonds are not issued by the New Zealand Debt Management
Offi ce, but their importance to New Zealand yield curves can be constructive.
Kauri Bonds are New Zealand dollar denominated and registered in New
Zealand, but issued by a foreign issuer (Groom 2008). This method allows
companies and institutions with overall funding programs in other curren-
cies to fund only their New Zealand investments. The Kauri bond issuance
began in 2004 and grew due to its acceptance as collateral in the New Zealand

repurchase-agreement markets (Groom 2008). Since acceptance, issuance has
grown steadily (Groom 2008). Prior to its formal acceptance, the euro-KIWI
bond held dominance (Groom 2008).
The NZDMO will issue infl ation-indexed bonds in 15-year maturities
that are indexed to New Zealand’s CPI. The fi rst issuance is proposed for late
2010, early 2011 but hasn’t materialized yet.
Treasury Securities are factored as a settlement price per New Zealand

New Zealand Dollar/U.S. Dollar and New Zealand
Yield Curves
What if we know New Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar rises in U.S. markets with
the rise of U.S. bond yields? The question of what direction will New Zealand
dollar/U.S. dollar take when New Zealand bond yields rise during New
Zealand trading is another issue.
Because New Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar are opposing pairs in this form,
New Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar will follow its own bond price up or down
rather than New Zealand bond yields. Stated differently, when New Zealand
bond prices are down, New Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar will fall, and rise when
bond prices rise.
Both markets have opposite effects due to the opposite alignment of the
New Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar confi guration. If the alignment were confi g-
ured as U.S. dollar/New Zealand dollar, then a completely opposite effect
would occur. The Royal Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) would rather see a rise
in New Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar more than any currency pair in their TWI.

Government Bonds, Yields, Yield Curves, and Currency Prices 181
The only method to obtain a weakening or rise in New Zealand dollar/U.S.
dollar is for U.S. bond yields to rise to levels acceptable to the RBNZ.
New Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar rises only on the basis of good U.S. eco-
nomic conditions. So if U.S. and New Zealand yield curves were compared
against each other, what would be the factors to go long or short? If yields
rose in the United States during U.S. trading hours and trading shifts to
New Zealand, chances are good New Zealand bond prices will rise and New
Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar will rise along with those bonds. This is so because
many nations and their currencies are dependent on a healthy U.S. economy
for their own healthy economies. Further, continuity normally exists from
U.S. to NZ markets as all take their cues from the United States. A down
U.S. market may easily see a down New Zealand market. It is the question of
the business of trade that New Zealand transacts in the United States more
so than any dependency factor. Yet if the U.S. economy falls, so does New
Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar. Continuity of markets holds as long as political or
economic news doesn’t disrupt the balance between markets.
Track New Zealand Dollar/U.S. Dollar
On the ASX, New Zealand trades the 30-day Offi cial Cash Rate Futures and
the 90-day Bank Bill Futures contract. Margin requirements were lowered in
May 2010 to a tier structure that enhances trading in these contracts. The
30-day contract is quoted in yield percent per annum in multiples of 0.005,
it is yield – 100. 1 basis point (cid:3) New Zealand dollar 24.66. New Zealand,
like Australia, works on a fi xed-tick arrangement. Multiply price movements
by the fi xed-tick dollar value of New Zealand dollar—24.66 per 0.01 move
by number of contracts (ASX).
Australian Dollar/New Zealand Dollar and Yield Curves
If New Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar and Australian dollar/U.S. dollar follow
their own bond prices during New Zealand and Australia trading, which way
will Australian dollar/New Zealand dollar move? This pair is the yield seeker.
Currency pairs must be viewed as not only trading mechanisms to profi t,
but mechanisms for fi nance. Currency pairs confi gured as New Zealand dollar/
U.S. dollar and Australian dollar/U.S. dollar only satisfy one side of the fi nance
equation. This was the reason for inventing these cross pairs. Australian dollar/
New Zealand dollar allowed for the fl ow of funds to travel either inside Australia
or New Zealand from abroad or it was used as a cheaper mechanism to fi nance

outfl ows. For this reason, Australian dollar/New Zealand dollar will always
move opposite to its counterparts in terms of yields and bond prices.
Think about the current economic conditions in Australia and New
Zealand. Both economies are growing in GDP and OCR. And both econo-
mies are earning enormous revenues from the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar and
New Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar confi guration from the U.S. dollar side. This
allows both currency-pair prices to rise, good for both nations. But what
about the U.S. dollar side of this equation? How does the U.S. dollar side
fi nance Australia and New Zealand operations against a high Australian
dollar/U.S. dollar and New Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar currency price? The
price is prohibitive in terms of Australian dollar/U.S. dollar and New Zealand
dollar/U.S. dollar. Australian dollar/New Zealand dollar satisfi es the U.S.
dollar side by following yields, and is used as the fi nance aspect for U.S. dol-
lar operations.
As Australian dollar/U.S. dollar and New Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar
prices continue to rise, Australian dollar/New Zealand dollar continues to
fall. These pairs are called U.S. dollar pairs because they allow the U.S. dollar
to seek yield outside of the United States. Or it allows fi nancing in Australian
dollar/New Zealand dollar to occur in yields at a preferable cost. So Australian
dollar/New Zealand dollar can also be viewed as a fi nance mechanism as it is
cheaper to fi nance in terms of yields than it is to fi nance in terms of a high
currency price.
In terms of the yield curve, Australian dollar/New Zealand dollar will fol-
low U.S. bond prices during U.S. trading, while Australian dollar/U.S. dollar
and New Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar will follow U.S. bond yields. The U.S.
dollar will follow Australian dollar/New Zealand dollar and Australia and
New Zealand bond yields in Australia and New Zealand trading.
Euro Yield Curve
The yield curve for the euro comprises four nations: france, Germany, Italy, and
Spain (German Finance Agency). Of the four, German bonds, called bunds,
comprise 21 percent of the European debt market, Italian bonds called BTPs
are 29 percent, French bonds called OATs are 20 percent, and Spanish bonds
called Letras del Tesoro comprise 7 percent (Investinginbondseurope.org).
The focus to trade the euro/U.S. dollar will be granted to German bonds
due to Germany’s powerful and always leading economic position in the
euro zone, its low debt compared to the others—euro 1.043 billion—and its
close proximity to the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Plus the ECB is housed in
Frankfurt and the German Bundesbank.

Prior to the euro, the German Deutsche mark was the leading currency of
Europe, so it is only natural that the Germans help steer the economic policy
process in Europe to secure their legacy from the Deutsche mark to the euro.
The last important consideration is that bunds are quoted and traded in euros.
The Germans issue two types of bonds, tradeable and non-tradeable. By
doing this, the Germans track two yield curves, one for tradeable bonds, and the
other for non-tradeable debt. The tradeable bonds with an interest rate exposure
comprise the two-year German Federal Treasury Schaetze Note, the fi ve-year
Federal Treasury Note, and the 10-year Federal Treasury Note. Federal Bonds
or bunds comprise the 30-year note and determine the long end of the curve.
Non-tradeable Bonds include the German Government Day Bond that
currently pays a rate per day of 0.21 percent (German Finance Agency). This
rate is managed by the German Finance Agency and represents an important
indicator. Purchasers receive par value plus interest to determine yields.
Federal Treasury Financing Paper offers maturities from 12 to 24 months.
Yields are determined by offering paper at a discount and redemption at
maturity. BuBills or bund Bills are discount paper offered for maturities of
six months and one year. Currently the Germans are negotiating the offer
of three- and nine-month BuBills.
Federal Savings Notes comprise a six-year note for type-A issues and a
seven-year note for type-B issues. Infl ation-indexed bonds include the 5- and
10-year note. Infl ation is tied to the interest rate at maturity.

Track the Euro Yield Curve
The German Bundesbank reports daily yield curves on its web site. Eurex
trades a 10- and 30-year bund Futures contract and Markit has an index
called the iBoxx that reports cash bond-market transactions for the euro.
Markit is many things in Europe: a data vendor, a market analysis provider,
and, through a host of indices that calculate within seconds, a market reporter
of up-to-the-minute market information. The information materializes quickly,
but it is reliable so any trade decision can be instituted with reliability.
The key for EURO/USD in European trade is once German yields are
up, the majority of European nations normally follow. At times the peripheral
nations can drag down EUR/USD prices such as the Greek crisis, Ireland cri-
sis, Italy, Portugal, and Spain termed the Pigs in market parlance. Peripherals
are other European nations.
Euro/British Pound and Yield Curve
Euro/British pound satisfi es the same scenario as Australian dollar/New
Zealand dollar. As euro/U.S. dollar and British pound/U.S. dollar seek their
yield from U.S. bonds and Bills in U.S. trading, euro/British pound as the
U.S. dollar pair follows U.S. Bond prices.
Euro/British pound and Australian dollar/New Zealand dollar are the
safe trades in U.S. trading as they like the safety backing of U.S. Bonds. In
European trading, the opposite scenario holds.
Euro/British pound loves yields while euro/U.S. dollar likes bund yields
and British pound/U.S. dollar likes the safety of the bond price. This says that

U.S. dollars seek yields in Europe through euro/British pound. Yet euro/British
pound is the fi nance mechanism for trade and other operations from the
United States to Europe and the United Kingdom to Europe. It is a pair of vital
importance and monitored continuously by the United Kingdom and Europe.
Swiss Franc Yield Curve
Between the SIX Swiss Exchange and Eurex, the Swiss offer up-to-the-minute
comparisons of not only their own yield curve as their bonds trade but an
interactive assortment of yields can be monitored to compare Swiss franc
bonds against other nations’ bonds.
Eurex trades derivatives and option contracts on bonds and various
investment instruments while SIX Swiss Exchange trades Swiss Sovereign
bonds through the Swiss Domestic Bond Index, termed the SBI. Any bond
in the SBI can be compared to 26 nations bonds so yield curves can be viewed
on a chart. This can be viewed from the interactive yield-curve tool directly on
the SIX Swiss Exchange web site. It is useful and reliable.
Because the Swiss so heavily monitor their economy and calculate every
transaction as it occurs, a trading decision based on yield curve comparisons
is very reliable. For example, Swiss franc yield curves can be compared to
U.S. dollar curves, euro to U.S. dollar, or euro to Swiss franc. Any combina-
tion of the 26 nations can be viewed within seconds. This interactive device
serves well for European trading but is employable in any market.
The Swiss offer fi xed SNB Bills formally known as Debt Register Claims
that are tradable money market instruments. SNB Bills are issued at a dis-
count in denominations of 28, 84, 168, and 336 days. Swiss Government
Confederate Bonds are offered in maturities of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
20, and 30 years.
To further measure Swiss Yield Curves, Scoach Schweiz introduced
a Yield Enhancement Index developed by Derivative Partners Research in
February 2009. Scoach Schweiz is an exchange that trades cash and forward
transactions in securities traded on the SIX Swiss Exchange.
The index comprises four products that offer coupons or discounts:
Discount Certifi cates, Barrier Discount Certifi cates, Reverse Convertibles,
and Barrier Reverse Convertibles. All are equal weighted with clean prices as
are the vast majority of Swiss fi nancial instruments. The index is calculated
once daily by Derivative Partners, but plans to calculate the index every three
minutes will materialize in the future.
Index calculations are derived from market mid prices that include the mean
of the best bid and ask price. The index is benchmarked against a synthetic index

The Swiss offer three variations of the SBI: SBI Domestic T with one- to
three-year maturities, SBI Government with three- to seven-year maturities,
and Domestic Government with 7-to 15-year maturities. Swiss yield curves are
factored based on accrued interest with yield variations based on each index.
The yield curve is factored as yield-to-worst-case scenario which is a Value as

U.S. Dollar/Swiss Franc
During New York trading hours, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc loves U.S. bond prices,
Swiss franc/U.S. dollar loves bond yields. The opposite holds for Swiss trading.
Swiss franc/U.S. dollar is the confederate bond follower, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc
the yield seeker. It is important to remember that the Swiss Central Bank much
prefer the Swiss franc/U.S. dollar confi guration. This principle is just like the
U.S. dollar/Japanese yen example. The Swiss would much prefer to earn Swiss
francs against the U.S. dollar. U.S. dollar/Swiss franc almost defeats the purpose
for the Swiss due to their enormous trade with the United States.
U.S. Yield Curve
The Offi ce of Debt Management offers T-Bills with maturities of one, three,
and six months and one year. Treasury Notes are offered in maturities of 2, 3,
5, 7, and 10 years. Treasury Bonds are offered with maturities of 20 and 30
years. The 30-year bond was reissued in 2006 (Treasury Department).
The following information was derived from Treasury Direct: Four-week bills
are issued every week, auctions occur on Tuesdays. Thirteen- and 26-week
bills are issued weekly, and auctions occur on Mondays. Fifty-two-week bills
are issued every four weeks, and auctions occur on Tuesdays. Two-year
notes are auctioned somewhere in the latter part of the month. Three-year notes
are issued on the fi fteenth of each month, with auctions around the middle
of the month. Five-year-note auctions occur somewhere in the middle of the
month. Seven-year notes are announced in the second half of the month, and

auctions occur in the middle of the month. Ten-year notes are announced in
the fi rst part of February, May, August, and November, and auctions occur
in the second week of that month. Thirty-year bonds are announced, issued,
and auctioned with the 10-year note.
The U.S. Treasury offers Treasury Infl ation Protected Securities (TIPS)
with maturities of 5, 10, and 30 years. Infl ation protected ties these securities
to the U.S. CPI. Five-year auctions occur the last week of April, 10-year TIPS
are auctioned in the second weeks of January and July, and 30-year TIPS are
auctioned in the last week of February.
The U.S. factors yield curves by two methods, the discount yield and
the investment yield. The discount yield is employed to factor three- and
six-month T-Bills and calculates as:
(FV (cid:2) PP)/FV) (cid:4) (360/M)
where
FV (cid:3) Face Value,
PP (cid:3) Purchase Price, and
M (cid:3) Maturity.
For three-month T-Bills, use 91 and use 182 for six month.
360 (cid:3) Bank calculation to determine interest rates.
The Investment yield relates the return to the purchase price of notes and
bonds. To factor:
R (cid:5) (FV (cid:2) PP)/M)/(FV (cid:5) PP)/2

R (cid:3) Coupon Rate,
FV (cid:3) Face Value,
PP (cid:3) Purchase Price, and
M (cid:3) Years to maturity.
Dollar Pairs and Yield Curves
The following pairs are cross pairs that are considered U.S. dollar pairs due to
their movements in terms of U.S. bond prices and yields. U.S. dollar/South
African rand is considered a dollar pair because it follows U.S. bond prices in
U.S. markets, but the U.S. dollar side of the equation follows yields of South
African bonds when trading in South Africa. The time difference is six hours
ahead when compared to New York Eastern Standard Time.

The Johannesburg Stock Exchange opens for trading in Bond Futures,
currencies and other stocks and derivatives at 3:00 a.m. EST and closes at
11:00 a.m. EST, so part of a New York morning will have duality of trad-
ing between both markets. Yet U.S. dollar/South African rand should and
normally does hold precedence in U.S. markets. This pair has large swing
tendencies that derive from the South African side for the U.S. dollar more so
than South African rand in U.S. trading. Look for the London gold fi x before
the Johannesburg close to swing this pair.
British pound/New Zealand dollar, euro/Australian dollar, British
pound/Australian dollar, and euro/New Zealand dollar are dollar pairs, but
the tendencies for all pairs are very volatile. Remember that neither pairs are
among the list of large interest in the central bank scheme of interested pairs.
The euro/New Zealand dollar was once an interested pair when euro-Kiwi
bonds were issued by New Zealand. Consider these pairs as a sort of outlier
arrangement. Sometimes they follow Treasury Bonds or yields, other times
they follow the U.S. dollar underlying pair. At times, movements may con-
found a trader. Overall they revert to trend, so wild swings may be market
gifts. So while these pairs are dollar pairs, volatility can be high and caution
is advised in any market.
Reserve Requirements and Bonds
Why the opposite scenario holds for currency pairs can be related to funding
requirements. Suppose a government passes a budget. Outside of tax revenues,
budgets are fi nanced by the sale of bonds. Because the budget is a known fi gure,
bonds will be sold to equal the number. This ties the particular nation’s cur-
rency into the budget fi gure. The currency now rises and falls based on revenue
earned or lost from bond sales and the direction it takes in the marketplace. Past
issuance means nothing unless large redemptions occur in short time frames.
A home currency can’t always be tied to yield because yield can’t be a
guarantee since it is costly and risky due to the many unknown market and
economic variables. Now suppose this nation can match its currency pair with
another nation’s currency. Suppose the second nation had a rising economy
and its bond yields or bond prices were rising. This allows revenue to be earned
by the fi rst nation by rising yields or bond prices. It is the method to offset its
own budget requirements. Stated differently, suppose Australia passes a budget
and sells its bonds. They will also know in advance what their currency price
will be at the start and end of the budget year, at least in terms of the target.
What if the price was, say, 9100 at the beginning and they planned for 9200 at



==================================================
                     PAGE 204                     
==================================================

190 Inside the Currency Market
the end of the year. Now Australia ties its currency to U.S. dollar bond yields.
U.S. dollar bond yields rise and Australian dollar/U.S. dollar trades to, say,
9500 and completes the year at 9700 Australian dollar/U.S. dollar. Australia
offsets its budget and bond sales from 9200 to 9700. It is a basic example, but
one that holds. Nations share the economic services of each other and are tied
together by currency-pair arrangements.
The same scenario holds for the United States, Great Britain, New Zealand,
Japan, Switzerland, euro Land, and Canada. One side of a currency pair is a yield
seeker while the other side is a bond follower. It is an economic relationship, a
relationship that has held since currency pairs became two-sided equations.
Reserve requirements form the basis of the bond sales. It is the target, the
rate that must be managed throughout the year, as bond sales are conducted
and revenue is earned from yields or bonds and economic conditions. All dic-
tate the imperatives of the bond sales in terms of issuance, prices, and maturi-
ties. The quarter-to-quarter LIBOR and in-nation rates help to manage the
yearly target on a quarterly basis.
As currency pairs became connected, it created a dependency—an inter-
dependency—that linked the world together. As new tax rules, cross pairs,
and issues of open borders for trade were created, the interdependency aspect
became tighter. Add the ability to communicate nation to nation through
technology, and we found the world not to be the wide-open spaces we once
thought. Suddenly we found New Zealand not to be such a distant and
unknown land. Further add the ability to fi nd advantage in each nation’s
economies, and the interdependency link became tighter.
Technology allowed us to know and understand New Zealand’s economic
structure in terms of merchandise trade, fi nancing mechanisms, central
bank operations, debt management, and stock and bond markets. The most
important aspect was to allow the world to evaluate the second part of the
currency-pair trade in an instant. It was found that smaller economies were
dependent on larger economies and all were dependent on the United States,
so their currencies aligned with the U.S. dollar with the hope of appreciation
to offset their own nation’s economic budgets. Up-to-the-second information
allowed a certainty of a trade, a confi dence feature.
Yet the United States offers nations the opportunity to sell their goods,
fi nance operations, and enjoy currency appreciation. This scenario describes
the vast majority of nations and their currencies, not just the major curren-
cies addressed in this text. To align with the United States presupposes that
the U.S. economy continues its historic winning ways in stable political and
economic growth. If the U.S. dollar falls, all will fall due to the many varied
investments that nations maintain in the United States.

As this text progresses, one would notice the uniqueness of a government
that helped to create an economic system that was designed not for its own
benefi t but for the benefi t of a world that could profi t and grow off its kind-
ness, open markets, political stability, and low regulatory structure. The U.S.
system is the complete opposite to other nations, and that is what gives this
economic system its uniqueness, a uniqueness that hasn’t been replicated nor
may ever be replicated again.
The relationship between other nations is not a dependency, rather it
is an opportunity that must be respected and appreciated the world over.
Without a stable United States, the world would literally be a very different
place under rules that would be quite harsh in terms of economic gain. The
United States is chosen as the destination for goods simply because it is one
of the world’s largest consumer markets with a rule of law and stable political
system.
Cross Pairs, Bonds, and Yields
The question of how will British pound/Japanese yen and Australian dollar/
Japanese yen trade in relation to bonds and yields is constructive. The answer
depends on which market.
In each respective market, both pairs will follow bond prices up and
down. The British pound will follow gilts and Australian dollar follows
Commonwealth bonds. This allows for stability of these pairs and allows
carry traders to safely earn their yields over time by the difference of inter-
est rates between their respective nations. In Tokyo trading, British pound
and Australian dollar will seek yields. In Australia and London trading, the
Japanese yen will seek yields. In U.S. markets, the answer is quite different.
In U.S. markets, both pairs seek yield. For the granddaddy of cross pairs,
the British pound/Japanese yen seeks the most yield and fi nds it in U.S. mar-
kets. The British pound/Japanese yen moves almost six pips to every one-pip
movement in the respective U.S. dollar pairs. This specifi cally applies to the
British pound/U.S. dollar, as the U.S. dollar/Japanese yen can be a laggard at
times. The British pound/Japanese yen in U.S. markets is a free fl oater, and
all advantage is taken to this free-fl oat movement. This movement can only
be explained by the enormous opportunities the United Kingdom and Japan
have for U.S. markets in terms of trade and interests. Issues of fi nance can be
conducted in any currency pair at any time. The price of any pair will deter-
mine which one to employ. Moreover, because this and other cross pairs like
Australian dollar/Japanese yen seek yield, it is the fast moving U.S. Treasury

market that explains the fast movement of these pairs. Bond prices fl uctuate,
therefore yields fl uctuate.
Trade Strategies
The currency-pair code of yield-seeker versus bond-price follower says much
for trades and trade strategies. Suppose the euro/U.S. dollar is in a trend in
U.S. markets. Based on the currency-pair code, it doesn’t mean the same pair
will trend in European trading. Yet it may trend.
As currency pairs change markets, new factors of consideration must be
contemplated from market to market. Factors such as economic conditions,
economic announcements, interest-rate decisions, bond issuance, and over-
all market conditions are just a small part of contemplation of what type of
market will trade.
The same trend in U.S. trading could easily become a range trade during
European market hours. This would require new strategic tactics to trade that
market. Those that expected a trend that never materialized are locked into
the position until trading shifts to the next market. Sometimes it is better to
trade in one market, take profi ts at closing, and evaluate market conditions
in the next market before employing a trade strategy.
For example, suppose the U.S. dollar/Japanese yen trended during U.S.
trading. Who would want to bank on the fact that this pair would trend in
Japanese trading, knowing the economic conditions of Japan? A range trade
may be the better consideration, or even a no-trade strategy. In this instance,
it may be a better arrangement to wait until European trading to evaluate
a trade in U.S. dollar/Japanese yen. The same applies for markets that shift
from Europe to the United States. A trending European market may result
as a range trade or a down market in U.S. trading that would require new
trade tactics.
So the question is will a trending currency pair trend in all markets, and the
answer is no, absolutely not. A correction of trend must come from a market
somewhere, but it doesn’t have to occur in the same market. Currency pairs must
be viewed within the context of every respective market it trades in, because no
two markets are the same nor will any two markets result in the same effects.
Profi ts in one market do not mean, nor do they guarantee, profi ts in another
market. A short in one market may be a long in another or a range trade.
For major currencies, Wellington, New Zealand, and Sydney, Australia,
represent one market. Asia is the second with Tokyo the main, Europe is the
third, and the United States and Canada is the fourth.

The idea that one can trade based on Fibonacci numbers is a losing prop-
osition. Fibonacci numbers may signal where a pair currently trades at one
moment in time, but don’t guarantee in what market a continued trend, cor-
rection, or range may occur.
The proposition by certain central banks to align with the idea to fl atten
yield curves purposefully until the next central bank meeting is construc-
tive in many respects. Will their markets be fl ooded with bond issuance at a
certain maturity? This is economic weakness to fl atten a curve. Will central
banks buy bonds from the market at another certain maturity is more economic
weakness to fl atten a curve. Control the currency price—more economic weak-
ness to fl atten the curve.
Or will these nations whose economic situations are dire regulate the
relationship of a currency pair by the regulation of movements? This is worse
than debasement of a currency because it wrecks the purpose, intent, mean-
ing, and economic relationship a currency has to the world economic order,
an order established and recognized since World War I. To regulate a free
market can only mean a forceful limit of a currency-pair’s movement and
admitted economic weakness to fl atten the curve.
Yield Curves and Currency Prices
Yield curves can now be drawn and plotted and a trading strategy planned.
How this is done depends on the trade strategy, which pair to trade, which
market to trade, which side of the yield/ bond strategy traders wish to follow,
and duration of the trade.
Short-term traders should look at the short end of any single nation yield
curve, or two curves if a trade runs into another market under another time
frame. Longer-term trades should be monitored specifi cally in terms of each
nation’s yield curves. The question should always be the relationship of the spread
and its narrowing, widening, or fl attening in relationship to bond maturities.
Any yield-curve strategy should account for BBA LIBOR, in-nation
LIBOR rates, and CPI within both nations, as all will correlate. For example,
suppose the United States released its CPI number at 2 percent, and 3 percent
was expected when three-month T-Bills traded at a yield of, say, 5 percent.
What would occur to the euro/U.S. dollar if a trader was long the euro/U.S.
dollar at the time of release? The euro/U.S. dollar would crash faster than he
or she could bail out because the three-month T-Bill would refl ect this new
CPI price and in turn the euro/U.S. dollar would also refl ect its new price.
LIBOR, CPI, and yields possibly anticipated the event but another scenario
occurred. Markets prices again always normalize and refl ect the new price.

==================================================

194 Inside the Currency Market
Yields and bonds have tendencies to trade outside of their respective cen-
tral bank target ranges. This is not unusual, as markets have tendencies of
anticipation or over-anticipations of events. Uncertain economic times may
be to blame, overanticipation of an economy may be as well. Many reasons
exist as to why.
One major reason is central banks are remiss in regular release of
their overall money supply M1 numbers that outline money stocks. Instead
of weekly releases, central banks release monthly M2 and M3 fi gures that
are in ranges to highlight money stock, credit, and lending conditions rather
than specifi c currency amounts. If we knew the money supply number
along with the new budget in terms of spending and anticipated bond sales,
we could know almost exactly the central bank target number for their
currency price. Absent the money supply fi gure leaves market professionals
to make educated guesses for a currency-price target. So economic events
are best guesses. Instead of best guesses, currencies will price in yield and
bond prices in relation to economic data. Either way, markets will always
normalize to the release and revert to trend. How long that takes is always
questionable. Normalization may take anywhere from minutes to months to
years.
An over anticipation may mean for example the euro/U.S. dollar rises
in price without the backing of yields to rise in price. This scenario is a false
move, so the euro/U.S. dollar will be sold to refl ect its true market price that
aligns to a yield. It is an opportunity for profi t and a market gift.
Suppose a LIBOR curve was plotted against a yield curve for any nation’s
bonds. Specifi cally, what if we plotted U.S. dollar LIBOR against a Treasury
yield curve or British pound LIBOR against a gilt yield curve? Exactly what
would we learn? Remember LIBOR and in-nation LIBOR have overnight to
12-month maturities, and bond yield curves extend 30 years for Treasuries
and 50 years for gilts.
The shorter end of each bond yield curve can provide vital answers to
currency direction when compared to the shorter end of a LIBOR curve,
especially in uncertain economic times because cash won’t be committed at
the long end due to economic uncertainty. Yet no two curves will look exactly
alike. Australia and New Zealand LIBOR and bond yield curves will look
very different than, say, U.S. dollar LIBOR and Treasury curves.
Yield curves as a forecast for trading currency pairs is contained within
one nation’s bonds and maturities with the view to look at other markets
for yield curve, yields, and bond direction. Here the focus is on inter-nation
spreads between maturities. Australia’s issuance of comparable bonds as a for-
mally listed trading vehicle is instructive of future events.

Government Bonds, Yields, Yield Curves, and Currency Prices 195
A main factor to measure spot prices in relation to yield curves is the cash
markets and the U.S. example will be employed, yet it may serve for almost
any nation.
The difference between the cash market and the yield curve in the United
States is bond auctions. Bond auctions represent the cash rate, the price inves-
tors are willing to pay. The yield curve is the measure that refl ects this new
price as auctions occur in various maturities, so yield curves will shift with
new bond auction prices. The U.S. Treasury schedules bond-maturity auc-
tions on a routine schedule rather than based on need in terms of economic
conditions. This method allows an economy and the yield curve to hold fairly
steady. The spot-currency price will factor within this matrix. A number of
measures exist with the assumption to measure a Treasury bond price to inter-
est-rate changes in yield curves.
Dollar Value of Basis Point and Modifi ed Duration
The CME factors DV01, dollar Value of a Basis point, as the average absolute
price changes of Treasury securities to a 1 basis point increase and decrease in
yield to maturity by:
((change in absolute value with 1 bp)
(cid:5) (change in absolute value with 1 bp))/2
The idea is that it captures the bond/yield inverse within small incre-
ments by when interest rates rise, bond price falls and vice versa. The purpose
of DV01 is to hedge, but it may serve for small currency price moves. It locks
one bond price against one small yield. The caveat is DV01 is not fi xed, it can
move as bonds and yields move.
Modifi ed duration is a weighted average maturity of Treasury security
cash fl ows. As yields fall, modifi ed duration increases and vice versa. The
formula
D (cid:3) 1/P (cid:4) change in P/Change in Y
This formula captures small changes in yield to maturity that affect the bond
price. It is a measure of interest-rate sensitivities of a fi nancial instrument.
If modifi ed duration is high, it says an instrument is more interest-rate sensi-
tive and vice versa. The Dow Jones Bond Index incorporates modifi ed duration

in its index calculation. While modifi ed duration is a few years old, it is still
widely employed by banks, as new methodologies haven’t been adopted as
standard practice. On the CME web site is an Empirical Duration tool that
calculates inputs for duration and DV01.
An important feature and wide use of modifi ed duration is to measure a
nation’s bond indices.
Traders in yield-seeking nations such as the United States, Europe, and
Canada must establish a cash rate in relation to the yield curve to determine
currency-pair prices. The iBoxx bond market in Europe is a cash index, and
can be compared to the same maturity in the futures contract.
For the United States, one measure of the cash rate in terms of yield
curves is the Treasury On-the-Run futures contract. It is a one-month con-
tract that changes with each new bond auction. It is the best measure of
cash prices in relation to yield curves, and contracts are offered for all U.S.
government maturities so yield curves can be measured against any maturity.
The recommendation is to focus on the various one- to fi ve-year contracts for
short-term measures of spot prices. On the Run can also be measured against
the concomitant futures maturity.
For nations whose bonds are tied to performance, such as England,
Switzerland, Australia, and New Zealand, the focus must be on the bond price,
particularly the short term. Yield curves operate as measures of risk rather than
measures of performance, so the bond indices and bond futures will be the
measure for spot prices in these nations. The actual methodology for profes-
sional traders is to connect the bond price to cash fl ows to factor a spot price.
Conclusion
The bond/yield interplay is useful and a vital tool to determine not only the cost
of money, but how money is priced in the markets within each side of a cur-
rency pair. Two nations’ yield curves constantly ebb and fl ow as well as a single
nation’s curve along the various maturities. The vital determination to measure
yield curves is in the slopes, but slopes must be measured in basis-point terms in
order to understand the insight into direction of a curve. Currency pairs move
based on this scenario due to the cost of each currency priced in the markets.
It is a market-driven rate rather than a controlled rate. How each side of a cur-
rency pair is priced in terms of an interest rate is found in the yield curve.

CHAPTER 7
Swaps and Forwards
Swaps and forwards are priced in the market as an interest rate and as an interest-
rate differential. How to price swaps and how they are traded in many of
their various forms will be outlined in depth in this chapter. The interest-rate
differential as it relates to forward points is not only discussed but an example
is presented. The chapter begins with a discussion of swaps and forwards and
their many types are detailed as examples. The various types of interest rate
swaps, their types, examples, and how they relate to the markets and currency
pairs in particular will be discussed and explained in detail on a step-by-step
basis. This chapter begins with an explanation of swaps and forwards along
with examples. Swaps comprise many types and all will be highlighted. Next,
the discussion will progress to each nation and their swap rates and/or index.
After internal-nation LIBOR are released and the price is settled for the
respective currency, the next rate for consideration is the swap rate. The swap
rate is constructive for many reasons.
It closely resembles a more truly priced currency on any given day within
the respective nation so the rate is vitally important to any trade strategy.
On a local level, swap rates are employed to price mortgages. For example,
mortgages in Singapore are factored either in terms of the three-month swap
rate or the three-month Singapore Overnight Rate (HSBC Singapore).
England factors fi ve-year fi xed rate mortgages against fi ve-year swaps. For this
reason, the fi ve-year credit default swap (CDS) is a priority indicator for the
Bank of England (BOE). These examples serve many nations’ mortgage mar-
kets, but all employ these rates in various ways. Swap rate is a market term.
In Europe, view a swap rate as an effective rate as part of the overnight
rate. It is shorter, more sensitive, moves with volatility within small ranges as
it trades, and explains currency and currency-pair movements and volatility

better than an overnight rate. This example deviates from standard defi ni-
tions but the euro is strictly a yield seeking currency and it will fi nd its best
movement when swap and internal LIBOR align properly. Does a swap rate
move bond prices and yields or do bond prices and yields move swap rates is a
debatable question, because different markets hold different answers. Market
events, economic events and projections, and risk versus non-risk are a few
factors for consideration. Swap rates can move quickly with events and cause
market volatility for currency pairs, so it is imperative to understand move-
ments in order to understand the relationship between the two investment
vehicles.
Secondly, the swap-rate spread can distill vital importance to future-priced
currencies because it closely resembles the direction and price of future
internal-nation LIBOR rates as well as Government bond prices and yields.
This is the Overnight Index Swap (OIS)-LIBOR connection. Finally, swap
rates provide a check, a further confi rmation of in-nation LIBOR, bonds,
and yields, and in turn provide affi rmation of the direction of a currency and
currency pair.
The swap-rate curve extends 30 years into the future because it repre-
sents the long, short, and middle of any government-bond yield curve. For
the United States, it is 30 years, for the United Kingdom it is 50 years, and
it is 40 years in Japan. For our purpose, it is the zero-to-three-month target
range that is of interest because it closely aligns to central bank interest in its
own three-month target period and because it aligns with government-bond
yield curves. Look at the swap curve as the guide between the interplay of
government bonds and yields and overall nation rates. It provides answers to
government-bond yield direction and in turn spot-currency prices because of
its risk nature. Government-bond yield curves are considered the risk-free rate
due to government backing, while swap curves represent risk because borrow-
ing and trading in swap rates occur at higher rates than bond-yield curves.
It is a measure of the health of banks since banks are the main traders of swaps.
So swap curves will always be higher than bond-yield curves. Normally this
represents a positive development when measured against each other. Yet if
bond-yield curves were ever higher than swap curves, that represents a nega-
tive curve and an economy in trouble.
For spot trades, it is the Interest Rate Swap, Currency Swap, and Cross
Currency Basis Swap that are of prime importance because they lend cre-
dence to direction of currency prices. A few examples follow.
An interest-rate swap. “Suppose Firm A invests in a bond that pays a
coupon of 5 percent yearly while Firm B invests in a fl oating-rate bond. The
two fi rms enter into a swap to exchange interest payments. An interest-rate

swap is defi ned as a fi xed versus fl oating arrangement. The purpose is to hedge
and/or manage funding risks” (Haubrich 2001).
A foreign-exchange (FX) swap. “A borrows X minus the spot rate U.S.
dollars from and lends X euros to B. At contract expiration, A returns X U.S.
dollars minus the forward rate to B and B returns X euros to A. FX swaps are
employed as a hedge against speculative trading and used by importers and
exporters” (Baba 2008). Yet central banks are heavily involved in the FX-swap
market, as will be seen in the New Zealand example.
An FX cross-currency basis swap. “A borrows X minus the spot U.S.
dollars from B and lends X euros to B. During the contract term, A receives
the euro three-month LIBOR and pays the U.S. dollar three-month LIBOR
to B every three months. At expiration, A returns X minus spot U.S. dollars
to B and B returns X euros to A” (Baba 2008). More specifi cally, what if, for
example, British pound/U.S. dollar basis swap spreads fall, then U.S. dollar
funding in terms of the cross-currency swaps would also fall. This is negative
for cross pairs and the British pound/U.S. dollar, and says sell both.
The Overnight Indexed Swap Rate on a derivative contract measures the
overnight rate for a particular nation (Sengupta 2008). This rate has a differ-
ent reference point from nation to nation. The swap spread is the difference
between the swap rate and government bond yield at any point along the yield
curve. Swap spreads in basis points measures the spread between 3 month FX
implied dollar rates and 3 month LIBOR. It’s a measure to determine if risk
exists in the market. The swap curve is defi ned as swap rates across maturities.
Swap rates can be defi ned as forward expectations of LIBOR. So a forward
LIBOR curve represents future LIBOR that determines future benchmark
interest rates as well as future infl ation and Consumer Price Index (CPI). Yet
currency forward implied rates can gauge an expectation of future spot prices.
Interest rates are the gauge.
Simple interest equals Interest (cid:4) principal (cid:4) rate (cid:4) time. Future value of
simple interest (cid:3) p (I (cid:5) rt), Compound interest FV (cid:3) P (1 (cid:3) r/n) nt, continu-
ous compound p (cid:3) amount ert where r equals interest rate expressed as a fraction,
n equals the number of compound periods, t (cid:3) time in days, months or years,
e (cid:3) natural logarithm. Simple forward interest Fv1 (1 (cid:5) rt) (cid:3) fv2, compound
fv1 (1 (cid:5) r/n) n (cid:3) fv2 and continuous interest (cid:3) fv1 ert (cid:3) fv2.
Interest rates are arranged to imply forward expectations. For example,
Forward interest (cid:3) FI1(1(cid:5) rt) (cid:3) F12
Future spot price curves and future interest rate priced in interest rate instru-
ments are then constructed.

200 Inside the Currency Market
Armed with this basic information, we can move to a nation-by-nation
look at swap rates and currency prices.
EONIA Swap Index
EURIBOR may be the overnight rate established for the price of the euro,
but it is the EONIA Swap Index that more closely resembles the actual euro
market price since EONIA is offered as a mid-market rate on any given day
by banks in the money market.
The EONIA Swap Index rate should not be confused with the EONIA
rate. The EONIA rate is like the Effective Funds rate in the United States,
while the EONIA Swap Index rate is quite different. The EONIA Swap
Index rate will always be above the EONIA rate, because borrowing costs will
always be higher at this level. EONIA sets the foundation for the EONIA
Swap Index rate and it is employed for trading swaps along the yield curve. The
EONIA fi xing time is 19:00 CET, while the EONIA Swap Index Fixing time
is 11:00 CET. Both should be monitored carefully.
Swap rates in the EONIA Index are offered from overnight to one, two,
and three weeks, monthly from 1 to 12 months, and yearly from one to two
years. The EONIA Swap Index rate is employed for interest rate and other
types of swaps and forwards. Twenty-fi ve banks comprise the Panel Committee
at the European Banking Federation (EBF) in Brussels that bid and offer for
euros, but all banks in the euro zone are involved in the swap market and all
have an interest in the EONIA Index (European Banking Federation).
Normally swap and forward traders follow the OIS rates and enter into
swap and forward deals based on the OIS. That’s fi ne. For the spot trade
and the euro/U.S. dollar in particular, the EONIA Swap Index is a much
better, much tighter index rate that tracks the euro much more closely than
the OIS.
Notice Exhibit 7.1, the euro/U.S. dollar chart, then refer to Exhibit 7.2,
the one-, two-, and three-month charts of the EONIA Index and notice the
period from January to May. Spreads and swap rates barely moved, yet as
spreads and swap rates widened between the one-and three-month period,
the euro/U.S. dollar trended down, but trended up when spreads decreased
and swap rates turned up in May. Further notice the upward pressure on the
three-to-nine-month swap rates as well as EURIBOR in Exhibit 7.3. This
scenario denotes a trend due again to the compression of spreads and resulted
in another trend on autopilot. All European rates can be viewed along with
various charts and historical rates on the EBF web site.

Australia Bank Bills
After Australia Bank Accepted Bills are settled for the price of the Australian
dollar, the Australian Financial Markets Association (AFMA) calculates and
releases the Bank Bill Swap (BBSW) reference rate. AFMA manages this rate
through bids and offers to swap Australian dollars by 14 banks that com-
prise the committee of bankers. Bids and offers are submitted to two decimal
places with a bid/offer of a fi ve-basis-point spread in each maturity on either
side. AFMA institutes established spreads for BBSW in each maturity that are
reviewed annually. Currently, the one-to-two-year swap rate attaches to it a
six-basis- point spread, the three-to-fi ve-year spread’s rate is eight basis points,
the 7- to 10-year is 10 basis points, and the 15 -year rate is 14 basis points. This
comprises the entire Australian Yield Curve and the bounds of fi xed-spread
swap rates.
After bids and offers are submitted, AFMA discards the highest and
lowest bids and offers, averages the remainder, and releases BBSW rates to
four decimal places promptly at 10:00 a.m. Sydney time on their web site
for one-to-six-month maturities. This time coincides with the 10:00 a.m.

Sydney Australian dollar/U.S. dollar fi x, an important time in Australia trad-
ing due to bids and offers for Australia dollar/U.S. dollar. Remaining rates
can be viewed by subscription to AFMA or through Thomson Reuters or
Bloomberg. This process is again repeated as swap rates are released at end
of day at 4:45 p.m. Sydney time in order to further price Australian dollar
interest-rate swaps as trading moves to Europe.
The method to factor swap rates and spreads is calculated against Australia
Bonds. The three-year bond futures contract’s last traded price is employed
to factor the two-to-six-year swap, while the 10-year bond futures contract
is used to calculate the 7-to-15-year swap. A yield rate is given for one-year
maturities.
So what is the price of Australia dollar/U.S. dollar in Australia trading?
Swap spreads like the EONIA example are the greatest determinant beside
yield-curve changes that would allow Australia dollar/U.S. dollar its best
movements. Because the Australia dollar yield curve is stable in terms of bond
issuance and the economic situation is currently resilient, swap spreads will
determine the answer. There are a number of factors for consideration.
The Australia Securities Exchange (ASX) trades a three- and 10-year
swap futures contract. The difference between the three- and 10-year swap
contract and the three- and 10-year bond futures contract is the coupon.
Interest rate swaps have a 6.5 percent coupon while the Treasury bond has a
6 percent coupon.
Swap curves will always be higher than government-bond curves because
swap borrowings occur above bond rates and have a higher cost due to their
risk and higher yields. Government yield curves are considered the risk-free
rate while the swap curve is the risk because it is above what is considered
safe risk. As swaps spreads widened, government bond yields go up and bond
prices go down, while a narrowing sends bond prices up and yields down.
The question is which side of the Australia dollar/U.S. dollar equation to
trade. The perfect scenario is the narrowing of spreads, because bond prices
will rise along with Australia dollar/U.S. dollar while Australia dollar/New
Zealand dollar will drop and vice versa. Swap spreads in Australia can only be
viewed by subscription to AFMA.
New Zealand Swap Rate
For the New Zealand wholesale markets and the swap market in particular,
the swap rate is produced by the New Zealand Financial Markets Association
(NZFMA). The NZFMA produces reference rates and overseas market rate

auctions, and collects, calculates, and reports reference rates for the New
Zealand wholesale markets through NZ Data, a growing subscription data
feed that allows users to view reference rates in real time. Current subscrip-
tions have been trending up as more banks and institutions around the world
become familiar with New Zealand’s stable and growing markets. Yet for
$100 NZ, anyone can view New Zealand’s wholesale rates in real time.
Swap rates are auctioned at end of day between 4:30 and 4:45 p.m.
NZ time and reported through SwapClose at 4:46 p.m., a section of NZ
Data. Exhibit 7.4 is an example of swap close. Swap rates are factored
for New Zealand’s government bonds that range from 1- to 15-year maturi-
ties. In addition, swap-to-spread pricing is factored for corporate fi xed
coupon bonds, local authority fi xed-coupon bonds, fl oating-rate notes, and
Kauri bonds.
The swap-to-spread basis is created from end-of-day bond fi xings released
by NZFMA for the New Zealand government and the bonds at 4:45 p.m.
New Zealand time. Spreads are added to interpolated yields against various
maturities. This is known as the outright yield. This prices the New Zealand
dollar as well as interest-rate swaps, both important components of Royal
Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) funding operations. Consider the 2010
report from the Executives Meeting of East Asia Central Banks, an organiza-
tion comprised of 11 regional central banks.
From January to September 2009, 48 percent of RBNZ funding opera-
tions were conducted in FX Swaps. Yet the RBNZ has a “high reliance on
FX Swaps, particularly Overnight and Tom/Next trades to meet daily
liquidity.”(Executive meeting report 2010). One reason why may be the
present economic crisis and possibly because NZ exports in another currency.
What makes New Zealand attractive is the dominance of yield differentials due
to New Zealand’s positive and high Offi cial Cash Rate (OCR). The RBNZ

swaps New Zealand dollars into another currency and converts back into
New Zealand dollars later. New Zealand’s institutions conduct business in the
interest of the New Zealand dollar but particularly as it relates to appreciation
of New Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar, their foremost pair of interest.
The true swap rate for New Zealand’s markets is the Bank Bill Reference
Rate (BKBM) released about 10:45 New Zealand time and used to settle and
adopt new trades such as interest-rate swaps and other various fi xed or fl oat-
ing deals during market hours.
End-of-day fi xes coincide perfectly with the August 2008 Williams/
Reuters 14:00, 2:00 p.m. New Zealand time fi x of the New Zealand dollar/
U.S. dollar. End-of-day swap and bond fi xes allow pricing and trading to
occur all night throughout other markets until the next New Zealand fi x.
But the 10:00 a.m. New Zealand fi x allows the New Zealand dollar/U.S.
dollar to be priced in New Zealand markets in terms of swap and bond pric-
ing. This is another sample of the brilliance of New Zealand’s institutions,
because not only is the yield curve factored against swap rates but as trading
occurs throughout the night in other markets, the price of New Zealand
dollar /U.S. dollar represents a true price and a method to gain appreciation
of New Zealand’s benchmark currency pair. New Zealand’s dilemma is time
differentials and the ability to connect fi nancial instruments to other markets
around the world. Consider a New York morning is a New Zealand night
and that summer in New York is winter in New Zealand. New Zealand must
constantly be creative to allow the connections to world markets.
Trade Swaps against New Zealand Dollar/U.S. Dollar
The equation of narrowing swap spreads leading to a fall in New Zealand
dollar/U.S. dollar is written explicitly and often in news releases at the New
Zealand’s Stock Exchange (NZX), as well as throughout New Zealand’s news-
papers such as the Dominion Post and the NZ Herald.
Spreads narrow and bond prices fall along with the New Zealand dollar,
called the Kiwi, is a commonly reported story as newspapers educate
the investing public. The spreads of reference are always reported as the
shorter-dated two-to-fi ve-year maturities. This accuracy is without question.
Possibly the reason for the fi ve-year spread reference is so much bond issu-
ance is brought to market by funding a fi xed rate against the fi ve-year swap
rate (NZDX). Yet notice Exhibits 7.5 and 7.6 and notice how important
and how many rates exist at the short end of the swap and Government-
bond yield curves. This is where traders will fi nd answers to New Zealand

duration and modifi ed duration is employed as a tool to track the index.
Moreover, New Zealand’s benchmark indices can be tracked against the New
Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar.
The ANZ swap indices include the one-year swap index, 2 year, 3 year,
4 year, 5 year, 7 year, and 10 year. Aggregate indices include the All Swaps
Index that covers the 1- to 10- year maturities. The ANZ Short End Swap Index
for one-, two-, and three-year maturities, the ANZ Short Mid Curve Index that
covers one to fi ve years, the Mid Curve are three-, fi ve-, and seven-year maturi-
ties, the Mid Long End covers 5-, 7-, and 10-year maturities, and the Long
End covers 7- and 10-year maturities. Additionally, a Kauri Bond Index, two
Bank Bill indices, and a host of government bond indices are perfect mea-
sures of New Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar. Due to the importance of the short
end of both the government and swap curve, New Zealand Bank Bill-futures
traded on the ASX should be viewed as the most important barometer of
New Zealand markets and the New Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar. For swaps,
narrowing of the two- and fi ve-year spreads sends New Zealand dollar/U.S.
dollar down and widening spreads sends it up.
Japan
A 2006 phenomenon inside Japan and among domestic Japanese banks is the
swap market. Many reasons exist for this.
The Bank of Japan (BOJ) restructured their operating target in 2006
from outstanding balance of accounts to present connection to Japanese Call
rates (Baba). This led to a slow growth into interest rate swaps, but those
swaps were initially employed primarily by overseas institutions (Baba).
Not mentioned is the Japanese Bank for International Cooperation,
which through the Japanese Finance Corporation developed relationships
outside Japan, fi nanced imports and exports, invested in overseas enterprises,
and developed relationships to ensure that oil, natural gas, and iron ore would
continue to fl ow into Japan’s manufacturing sector. Yet many enterprises were
established within the respective nations that trade with Japan to ensure access
to natural resources and were fi nanced by foreign currency bonds ( Japanese
Bank for International Cooperation). Swap trades were vital to these endeav-
ors and the continued health of the Japanese economy because yen had to
fl ow between various nations.
Interest rate swaps were employed using the OIS rate against or included
six-month LIBOR against Japanese Government Bond (JGB) futures. As the

==================================================

Swaps and Forwards 209
call rate became a more familiar phenomenon, trades in the OIS rate were
used for hedging and/or gain advantage in interest rates since the call rate is
a fl oating daily rate (Baba). Prior to the use of swaps, Euroyen futures were
employed for hedging. The second aspect of slow swap market growth is due
to the structure of Japanese Banks.
The Japanese banking sector is organized into public and private institu-
tions with each bank serving a distinct function. Public and private banks
include six city banks, 64 regional banks that serve only the prefecture in
which they reside, 61 foreign banks that account for 0.8 percent of the
overall banking market, 19 trust banks, 162 credit cooperatives, and 740
Agricultural Cooperatives. Life insurance companies are deeply intertwined
within this structure (Japan Bank Association). There are a number of factors
for consideration.
Despite the change to call rates as the BOJ target, the Japanese since
2004 had swap trades completely fi gured. By 2005, practice trades from fi xed
to fl oating and fl oating to fi xed were in the implementation stages by the
Ministry of Finance. Not only was a JGB curve established but a swap curve
was implemented based on a Quadratic Gaussian model and chosen due to
its linearity because of low call rates (Ministry of Finance). This is known
more formally as the Hull and White method.
The JGB is the heart of the Japanese economy so swap trades had to
be factored to the nth degree before an offi cial trade was implemented. Yet
this is normal Japanese analytics. Another problem included the hesitation to
publish JGB yield-curve data because a new 40-year JGB was in the planning
stages and scheduled for a 2007 release (Ministry of Finance). The proposal
at the time was to release JGB interest rates only, and that would equal swap
interest minus the spread to satisfy the curve.
Original trades factored as a measure to manage interest rate risk espe-
cially large bond redemptions. So a long-term swap included fi xed versus
fl oating receipt while the medium term included a fl oating payment against a
fi xed receipt. The JGB curve equaled an estimation of the swap curve plus the
swap spread. Despite a lengthy study, swaps still represent a small portion of
Japanese trading within their banks and institutions for a number of reasons.
The fi rst factor is the call rate is 0.10 percent, and that rate has slight
volatility. TIBOR would suffi ce, but would this rate factor as a fi xed or fl oat-
ing leg of a swap and what would be the domestic instrument that could
be used against it? For U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, which side of the equation
would be employed in a currency swap? To solve this dilemma, the Japanese
employ basis swaps where yen LIBOR is exchanged for U.S. dollar LIBOR or
vice versa. This leaves the OIS rate.

==================================================

210 Inside the Currency Market
The OIS rate began in 2007 as a trading vehicle with 31 mostly foreign
institutions and nine domestic banks involved in trades (Ministry of
Finance). OIS swaps were paired with JGBs, interest-rate swaps, and
Euroyen futures. Despite the initial introduction to Japanese society, OIS
is still not a huge portion of overall trading and not employed as a fund-
ing vehicle by the BOJ.
Overseas swaps represent huge transactions but those deals are tied to
currency bonds of the respective nation of business. In European markets,
a number of vehicles exist to measure the yen that will be addressed later.
The answer for the Japanese market to profi t with respect to U.S. dollar/
Japanese yen is the JGB or Euroyen futures. The only other alternative to
measure risk is watch the credit default swaps that trade on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange (TSE).
The Tokyo Stock Exchange in conjunction with Markit iTraxx now trades
a series of credit default swap indices. For the Japanese market, the bench-
mark Japan series 12 is the fi ve-year credit default swap index most watched
and reported by market professionals to gauge market risk. It is referred to
as the hedge index due to the ability to buy and sell protection against other
market positions. The Series 12 index encompasses 50 investment-grade
Japanese entities (TSE). As spreads increase, credit deteriorates. This is a sell
U.S. dollar/Japanese yen as the cost of fi nance increases.
Trade Web, LCH Clearnet, and ICAP
All three organizations support swap trades. Trade Web trades yen interest-
rate swaps and JGBs against six-month LIBOR from 9:00 a.m. Tokyo time
to 4:00 p.m. London time. (Trade Web). ICAP through i-Swap trades inter-
est rate swaps, OIS, cross currency basis swaps, and EONIA. LCH Clearnet
clears more than 40 percent of the interest-rate swap market (LCH Clearnet).
All are worldwide organizations and all can be employed to track the swap
market.
United Kingdom and British Pounds
Interest-rate swaps or better-termed British pound-swap rates are factored
based on sterling overnight rates. Sterling overnight rates encompass two
aspects, SONIA and British pound six-month LIBOR. Both represent the
fl oating rate side while Overnight Indexed Swaps or OIS are fi xed legs.



==================================================
                     PAGE 225                     
==================================================

Swaps and Forwards 211
The OIS side are swap rates that are market-driven rates rather than a rate set
by a market association.
SONIA-OIS represents the shortest maturities because of its function as
an overnight rate. Contracts rarely exceed six-month terms and most banks
trade SONIA-OIS due to interest rate speculation or to meet funding needs
(Joyce, 2008).
LIBOR swaps settle against six-month British pound LIBOR with
maturities ranging from 2 to 30 years. LIBOR swaps are employed to reduce
funding costs and hedge longs in cash markets. (Joyce).
Spreads equal the difference between gilt yields and swap rates. If the spread
between British pound LIBOR and OIS widens, interbank lending falls. This
is a sell British pound/U.S. dollar. Three methods exist to measure swap rates:
government liability curves, bank liability curves, and implied probabilities.
Government liability curves for the BOE is a measure of zero-coupon
yields for gilts and GC repo rates with maturities out to two years. This is
a daily release by the BOE. Bank liability curves measure shorter maturities
such as LIBOR, short sterling futures, and forward-rate agreements for the
short forward curve. Interest-rate swaps are included for a longer bank liabil-
ity forward curve. But the measure here is more to gauge the BOE’s Bank
Rate rather than a swap rate measured against gilt yields. A fi nal method
exists to factor both.
Suppose an instrument was chosen to measure an underlying distribu-
tion for the OIS rate and the LIBOR-OIS spread. A distribution should
be bounded below zero. Assume a log normal distribution with means equal
to the forward OIS rate and forward LIBOR-OIS spread. Aggregate the OIS
rate and LIBOR-OIS spread distribution to give the sum of OIS minus the
(LIBOR minus the OIS). Compare option-implied LIBOR distributions
and search combinations of distributions for OIS rates and LIBOR-OIS
spreads to fi nd the best replication of option-implied LIBOR distribution.
This is the indicative distribution, a probable distribution for OIS rates and
LIBOR-OIS spreads.
The problem associated with the BOE’s bank liability curve and implied
probabilities is the measure of the BOE’s bank rate measured forward over
a short period of time, usually three months. Neither method is perfect to
measure swap rates, but a better measure of the current 0. 5 percent bank rate.
Yet all three can indirectly measure swap rates and the swap curve, as the bank
rate will provide direction to the swap rate. The original purpose of swap rates
was to supply funding slightly above gilt yields due to the premium involved
in the swap transaction. So indirectly swap rates should equal gilt yields of
various maturities.

==================================================

212 Inside the Currency Market
OIS rates were once very stable rates and rarely moved in terms of basis
points so OIS represented a perfect fi xed-leg option to the SONIA and
LIBOR fl oating leg. Economic crisis caused OIS rates to skyrocket and move
far out of market norms. This further caused OIS and the fl oating interest-
rate swap legs to become fl oating as market uncertainty grew. As OIS became
the norm and stable fi xed rate, SONIA and LIBOR represented the unse-
cured portion of the fl oating leg. Now both are treated as unsecured.
So a better measure was needed to gauge swap rates and gilts against
interest rate swaps.
The BOE factors swap spreads as the sum of two-year interest rate swap
settles on six-month LIBOR minus two-year OIS plus the sum of two-year
OIS rate minus two-year generic gilt spread.
Canada
Canada employs CDOR-OIS as a means to fi nance interest-rate swaps, yet
overnight transactions account for 10 to 20 percent of daily trading volume
in U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar (Canadian FX Committee 2010). FX swaps
account for 64.3 percent of daily trading volume, 23.8 percent in spot trans-
actions. This says the majority of Canadian offi cial business is fi nanced by a
currency other than the Canadian dollar. The vast majority of all U.S. dollar/
Canadian dollar transactions were done for seven days or less with the U.S.
dollar as the primary foreign currency. Between 2005 and 2010, FX swaps
volume remained stable. The last fact is spot U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar
spreads on $50 million or more was 8 to 10 points before the economic crisis
but widened to 20 to 25 points during the peak of the crisis (Canadian FX
Committee 2010). Another aspect to fi nance is the fi xed OIS against a fl oat-
ing CORRA rate. Swap rates here are based on CORRA, Canada’s overnight
repo rate. As swap spreads widen, sell U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar or long
Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar.
Swiss Swaps
SARON is the offi cial overnight rate for the Swiss and is employed in inter-
est-rate swaps. For research, the SNB is by far the worst. If the answer is not
found at the SIX Swiss Exchange, a search for Swiss information throughout
the Swiss government is futile.

On the SIX Swiss Exchange along with the interactive yield-curve func-
tion is the ability to interactively employ Swiss and other nation’s swap rates
against any nation’s yield curves. It is a fabulous tool and worthwhile for trad-
ers of all investment instruments due to its high reliability. One can perform
bond-nation comparisons with any maturities or individually, compare indi-
vidually, or compare interest-rate swaps and deposit rates.
United States
Two methods exist to measure the U.S. market. The 30-day Fed funds futures
contract tracks the overnight Fed funds rate for a month. But the three-month
OIS more closely tracks effective rates and it provides a guide to expectation
and probabilities of those rates. The key word is probability as U.S. mar-
kets track Fed funds-rate increases or decreases based on probabilities. Other
nations use different methodologies.
To calculate, Futures price minus 100, 1.00 minus 0.98 with an expected
25-basis-point change.
(Target fed funds) (cid:2) (implied rate) (cid:3) rate spread
1.00 (cid:2) 0.98 (cid:3) 0.02. (rate spread)
(cid:3) percent chance of 25 basis point change
(25 basis point change)
0.02 / 0.25 (cid:3) 0.08
No confi dence in a rate hike at this point.
What is tracked is U.S. interbank deposit rates that settle based on
actual/360. An inverse relationship exists between interest rates and the OIS
contract. If interest rates head higher, the contract price falls and vice versa.
It’s a longer-term gauge inside deposit rates and a great method to trade
FOMC meetings and rate expectations.
The purpose for a swap transaction is varied. Some may wish to hedge
an interest-rate risk using OIS contracts while others may employ OIS as a
forward contract that exchanges fi xed for fl oating streams. Currency swaps
are varied as well. Some may borrow in one currency and lend in another
currency. Some employ these methods for conversion purposes, while others
will for example sell U.S. dollar debt in exchange for another currency.
Canada for example employs interest-rate cross currency swaps to fund
foreign-currency reserves by issuing fi xed-rate domestic bonds then swap into
fi xed- or fl oating-rate debt. Many facets of the swap market exist as well as



==================================================

==================================================

214 Inside the Currency Market
many variations of a swap curve from nation to nation due to the difference
in focus to employ monetary policy that meets three-month target rates. Yet
since the Lehman Brothers’ collapse, the major focus for central banks and
traders is the focus on the short term due to market uncertainties and because
so many fi nancial instruments now exist that focus on the short end.
Central banks have a three-month horizon with a daily monitoring of
overnight rates with the opportunity to hedge any market risk. Money must
constantly move in order to keep it working within an economy. For this
reason, the swap market can provide vital information in terms of a spot
transaction.
The further reason for the increased focus on the swap market is the
recent development that central banks employ eight monetary policy
meetings a year. These meetings determine policy rates and gauge eco-
nomic development in the future. This further enhanced the short-term
economic focus.
The gauge is the spread. As spreads widen, it’s always a sell position as the
cost of business is too high. To understand this varied market is to understand
the forward market.
Outright Forwards
The method to connect interest rate swap conditions is to employ forward-
implied rates. The forward price of a currency must relate to an interest-rate
differential between two currencies. The classic defi nition says it assumes an
arbitrage condition is possible if parity doesn’t exist.
A formula to look at this relationship is:
t* (cid:2) i (cid:3) se (cid:2) s (cid:5) p
i t t (cid:5) 1 t t
where
t* (cid:3) foreign period nominal interest rate,
i
i (cid:3) domestic period interest rate,
t
s (cid:3) spot rate (foreign to domestic in logs),
t
se (cid:3) market one step ahead forecast for the spot rate at t, and
t(cid:5)1
p (cid:3) risk premium.
t
This formula captures bond-yield differentials that refl ect expected exchange-
rate movements over the life of the bond, plus risk. This methodology is

termed covered-interest parity and is designed to determine where the spot
price is trading in relation to the forward rate. The correct term is uncovered
Interest Parity but if a position is covered by an interest rate, it’s no longer
uncovered. The purpose of both serves as a method to determine interest rates
and conditions of parity. Much has been written on this topic in the 30 years
since its early inception. Forward points actually found its beginnings since
World War II, but its importance as a trading vehicle began when the gold
standard was set aside in exchange for fl oating exchange rates.
The formula
F (cid:3) S (1 (cid:5) r/1 (cid:5) rf )t
where
F (cid:3) the current forward rate,
S (cid:3) current spot rate,
r (cid:3) domestic interest rate for term t,
rf (cid:3) foreign interest rate for term t, and
t (cid:3) time to delivery.
The formula can also be viewed as
F (cid:3) S(1 (cid:5) rate cc1 t)/(1 (cid:5) rate cc2 t)
where
F (cid:3) Forward rate,
S (cid:3) spot,
cc1 (cid:3) interest rate of currency 1,
cc2 (cid:3) interest rate of currency 2, and
t (cid:3) time.
The key term is foreign to domestic interest rate. This category is where
overnight rates are factored, LIBOR, effective interest rates, repo rates, yield
curves and market rates such as a T-Bill. A spot price and forward point can
be found within the calculation.
A forward points is the most important and vital link to understanding
currency spot prices as well as their relationship to other pairs and fi nancial
instruments.
The key to forward points is points per day, which is the link to deter-
mine the cost of maintaining a position overnight through either a Tom/Next,
overnight, or spot/Next trade. These are rollover rates and are debited or
credited to accounts at the 5:00 p.m. EST closing.



==================================================
                     PAGE 230                     
==================================================

216 Inside the Currency Market
Outright forward points trade at a discount or premium depending on
which side of the currency pair is the lesser or greater interest-rate currency.
Forward points are quoted against spot. A long or short position is debited or
credited based on interest rates that translate to forward points and factored
into a spot price. The determination to roll over daily is how many forward
points are debited or credited based on the 5:00 closing.
If a trader is long the greater interest-rate currency pair, that account
will be credited and debited for the lesser interest-rate currency to refl ect the
premium or discount in each pair. The greater interest-rate side of a pair is
the premium, while the lesser pair is the discount. Its market is determined
based on any day’s trading.
More important to forward points is the prediction to determine possible
future spot prices. Outright forwards and forward curves are good factors, a
future prediction based on present market conditions based on interest rates.
Today’s forward points drive future forward predictions.
Forward points are bounded by the interest rate differentials within each
currency pair. Those interest-rate differentials are refl ected in the market by
traders that anticipate changes to monetary policy made by central banks.
Both sides are bounded by interest rates, but short interest rates change daily
so forward points will change daily. Central banks maintain rates 25 to 50
basis points from current rates yet markets and traders anticipate future rates
refl ected in bonds, yields, and forward points. Sometimes the market over-
shoots the target, sometimes not. So forward points are bounded within the
context of a spot price by the bond/yield interplay on one side and monetary
policy on the other. Monetary policy means rates rise, fall, or stay the same
and it’s the overall driver of spot prices.
The twist is that each central bank meets eight times yearly but not at the
same time. So currency pairs maintain monetary policy within its price based
on two monetary policies. The interest rate is the measure and is found in the
markets because it streamlines the tedious process to factor every economic
announcement, every bond issuance, every cash fl ow, and every basis point
yield.
So a forward point represents an interest rate, an expected rise, fall, or
stasis condition and is refl ected in the bond/yield interplay on a daily basis.
Because currency pairs are two-sided equations between two nations, yield-
curve spreads could be measured by forward points to arrive at a daily spot
price. Yet as markets, bond prices and yields change, so do forward points
and spot prices. Forward points can rise and fall within a trading day. Fixing
times are most important for pairs and forward points because they establish

Swaps and Forwards 217
a spot reference price for central banks, importers and exporters, banks, and
major companies to lock in a price. Fixing times are best points for profi t
because they distill confi dence in a price and the market will follow its price,
so volatility may occur if the market price is far from the fi x.
The idea of interest-rate differentials is the method how and where
money must seek its yield, yet it is the cost of capital. Forward points repre-
sent interest income or the cost of capital.
For example, forward points are quoted as 0.0094, which means mul-
tiply by either 100 or 1000 and the price of interest is established for one
side of a currency pair. If the other side is, for example, 74, multiply by 100
or 1000 and the other side is established. Interest payments are factored. To
receive the 94 in interest from the bid side, a buy forward/sell spot is trans-
acted or a sell spot/buy forward. To gain the 94 interest, buy spot and sell
the other side of the pair forward, the 74. Forward means from one day to
10 years. Positions can always be rolled over if a trade was entered for a short
duration. A rolled position means rolling over the same trade for a longer time
frame. The offer side works the same, sell forward/buy spot. The methodology
is to buy/sell, sell/ buy. Look at bids and offers as lend/borrow. And look at
forward points as the guide to interest income. Refer to the currency swap
examples above. All take the form sell/buy, buy sell. A nation like Japan with
a defl ationary environment and low interest rates must seek higher yield in
other markets. Monetary policy in Japan has been stifl ed by current and past
conditions, so traders and investors sought yield in higher interest-rate pay-
ing nations. This was the basis for the methodology for carry trades that later
became accepted practice and the basis for the yen to become the funding
currency. Lastly, it became the basis for the Japanese to transfer operations to
offshore markets.
Market anticipation in terms of forward curves alludes to construction
of the curves. Banks may employ OIS strips, zero-coupon strips, or forward/
forward FRA strips to discount two different yield curves.
As time progressed and the use of swaps became an increasing phenom-
enon, forwards were factored for implementation in various currency-swap
arrangements.
Forward traders are actually spot traders. The difference is forward traders
trade based on forward points, interest-rate differentials. Those interest-rate
differentials are found between two nations’ yield curves and depend on
which of two maturities is the focus.

As fi nancial instruments constantly trade, interest rates will change along
with fast market movements. So a calculation must be made constantly to
fi nd a mismatch of rates. Calculations are provided for forward points.
There are two factors for consideration within the formula. Day counts
must be specifi c and interest payment schedules must be factored in monthly,
quarterly, semi-annual, or as bullet pay. Bullet pay is defi ned as no interest
payments. Principal and interest is paid upon maturity.
Forward points in terms of a currency price can be factored against many
fi nancial instruments. The key to other calculations is to divide the cash rates
by the futures rates. A stock market index can be factored against a spot price
by fair value calculations. The key is to determine index points and factor
those points against spot forward points.
In bond terms, a U.S. 30-year Treasury is priced in thirty-seconds is
$312.50 each thirty-second or $3,000 per point. One basis point on a 10-year
bond is $1,000 plus interest fl ows quarterly, semi-annually, or annually.
A foreign bond is equal to one basis point British pound 1,000 and British
pound 3,000. Foreign bonds trade 0.01 percent. The key to understand for-
eign bonds in relation to spot prices and forward points is to understand and
measure cash fl ows.
In the United States, average treasury yields on any given day trade about
1.48 for the two-year, 2.18 for the fi ve-year, and 3.21 for the 10-year. Each
nation’s yield curve must be measured against these rates for U.S. dollar
traded pairs.

Swaps and Forwards 219
Conclusion
This chapter focused on the various types of swaps. It began with currency
swaps, cross currency swaps, and basis swaps and examples were provided, as
well as types of traders that would employ each type. Swaps comprise many
types, such as OIS swaps, and connect to other revenue sources. All types
were provided by explanation and example, as well as types of markets that
employed these instruments. Forward points and outright forwards were
highlighted and explained and examples provided for each instrument.

CHAPTER 8
Stock and Bond Markets
The focus of this chapter is nation-to-nation stock and bond markets and the
dynamics of the two markets in relation to currency prices. Bond markets are
indicators to stock market direction because of their early opening from for-
mal stock market opens. This interplay as an indicator prices yields and yields
price currency pairs. An in-depth look into each nation and the dynamics of
each structure will be highlighted, as well as the characteristics of each cur-
rency pair within the respective market.
Stock markets in the respective nations that are attached to one side of
a currency-pair trade can provide vital answers to direction of that pair for
many reasons. The fi rst point is stock markets determine direction of the
interplay between bonds and yields. In this instance, it answers the question
whether to go long or short a pair in a particular market. This represents
profi ts or losses.
Secondly, stock markets must be looked upon as a risk indicator. In the
United States, Germany, and Canada, rising stock markets are measures of
risk because government bond yields rise with the currency. Stock markets
ebb and fl ow, so currency pairs will ebb and fl ow as pairs follow the bond
yield interplay.
Rising stock markets represent the fact that LIBOR, repurchase agree-
ments, effective, and swap rates all fell into a perfect pattern that allowed the
rise. Currency pairs move based on interest rates, so sometimes the proper
alignment of the most important of rates allows stock markets to rise, yet an
improper alignment allows stock markets to fall. This equation is not neces-
sarily written in stone as outside developments can disrupt the balance, but
it’s always better to follow the equation as a high probability for stock-market
moves. Economic performance is the sole reason for stock-market move-
ments, up during good times and down during bad.

222 Inside the Currency Market
Stock markets provide either early warning down signs or positive up
signs that ensure currency pair direction. Yet they provide answers as to which
pair to trade and in what direction to take that particular pair. Because the
Australian Stock market opened doesn’t mean only the Australian dollar/U.S.
dollar should be traded. Almost any pair can be traded in any market. The
question must be which pair and what direction, long or short? If a stock
market chooses not to rise or fall and instead ranges, that can be a vital source
of profi ts as range tops and bottoms can be bought and sold. For this reason,
stock markets should be evaluated as closely as any currency pair and mea-
sured against ranges.
To hold currency pairs through many markets means a further evaluation
and proper knowledge of other nations’ stock markets. Stock markets have
defi nite opening and closing times within nations, but in many instances
stock market openings and closings overlap around the world. This could
have dramatic effects on a trade held throughout many markets. An up mar-
ket in Australia doesn’t automatically presuppose an up market in Japan, so an
exit may be necessary from the Australian market before the Japanese open-
ing. But continuity may exist, so a trade can possibly run throughout other
markets. London, Frankfurt, and the SIX Swiss Exchange all trade at some
point together on any trading day, while Canada and the United States open
later in the day—that leaves these fi ve markets trading at the same time. This
situation could represent enormous profi ts, but without proper knowledge,
huge losses.
Stock markets around the world sometimes correlate, sometimes not.
Correlations occur provided an economic situation doesn’t force a change of
direction. Wars, natural disasters, and even political personnel changes can
force dramatic and immediate directional changes.
Correlations normally occur within regions such as Australia and New
Zealand, or the United States and Canada. Yet each nation is completely
a separate entity with various monetary policies, various interest rates, and
various objectives to achieve its goals. For this reason, stock markets will react
very differently. A 100-point rise in Japan doesn’t correlate to the United
States market rising 100 points. Correlations indicate ups or downs rather
than exact point movements. The key to correlations is to follow the leaders
as they provide direction, yet leaders doesn’t necessarily correlate as the United
States or Europe, because anything can occur throughout the markets within
a trading cycle. A leader could be Australia as easily as Japan.
For currency pairs in U.S. markets, always look at yen crosses as the
measure of stock-market risk. Australian dollar/Japanese yen should move in
conjunction with Australian dollar/U.S. dollar if confi dence exists. Canadian

dollar/Japanese yen is the premier measure of risk in Canada trade simply
because of its correlation to oil. Confi dence in Canada and the U.S. economic
system means Canadian dollar/Japanese yen should move in conjunction with
Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar. British pound/Japanese yen should move in con-
junction with British pound/U.S. dollar. euro/Japanese yen should move in
lockstep with euro/U.S. dollar. A rising stock market may see for example
euro/U.S. dollar rise, but if euro/Japanese yen doesn’t follow, the stock market
bond/yield interplay is not a sign of confi dence. Without confi dence in stock-
market moves, any rise in, say, euro/U.S. dollar without euro/Japanese yen as a
follower, means euro/U.S. dollar can’t hold any gains. Euro/Swiss franc, how-
ever, will always maintain its dominance as the premier measure of risk. U.S.
dollar/Swiss franc and Swiss franc/U.S. dollar confi dence must be measured
with euro/Swiss franc, especially during European trade. Yet euro/Swiss franc
serves well as a risk measure in U.S. markets.
Stock markets, just like currency pairs, tend to function in wave pat-
terns during normal economic periods. Each nation or region experiences
tops or bottoms throughout any given year. To know tops and bottoms helps
to understand how to profi t with various currency pairs.
All markets and all fi nancial instruments experience this wave pattern
and the patterns are as defi nite as the seasons of change. It’s as if each nation
receives a turn in the wave-pattern structure. Through this structure, stock
markets fi nd tops and bottoms, currency pairs experience tops and bottoms,
bonds and yields experience tops and bottoms, and LIBOR experiences tops
and bottoms. One must wonder if wave-pattern structures were a manmade
design as a consequence to ensure that every nation prospers or the Invisible
Hand of self-regulating markets fi rst outlined by Adam Smith in 1759 in The
Theory of Moral Sentiments and later in 1776 in An Inquiry into the Nature and
Causes of the Wealth of Nations.
With the introduction of the euro in 1999, the newly formed G-20
Finance Ministers began regular meetings to discuss world economic events.
At the time of the 1997 Asian crisis, when Asian currencies crashed, the intro-
duction of the euro was foremost on their minds. The statement in 1999
from the fi rst meeting in Berlin began with a policy to “make globalization
work.” Further, “evaluation by nations’ compliance with international codes
and standards in transparency and fi nancial sector policy” and “examination
of differing exchange-rate regimes and role to cushion impact of international
fi nancial crisis.” They sought reform and globalization, an integration of the
world and markets.
The 2000 Montreal meeting sought to “reduce countries’ vulnerabili-
ties to fi nancial crisis including exchange-rate arrangements.” From 1999

224 Inside the Currency Market
onward, governments began the policy of management in terms of capital
fl ows, trade policy, movement of goods, taxes, debt, and strengthening of
international institutions to carry out these policies evidenced by further
communications.
Further, the G-10 nations, the forerunner to the G-20, voted in 1999
to change the name and mandate of the Bank of International Settlements
(BIS) euro Currency Standing Committee from a mandate that monitored
off-shore deposits and lending-market issues to the Committee on the Global
Financial System to recognize, analyze, report, and monitor threats to fi nan-
cial stability (BIS). Whether manmade or the Invisible Hand, one may never
know. The import is to understand market ebbs and fl ows, but be aware of
policies that may disrupt the present global-market order.
All fi nancial instruments ebb and fl ow in waves, so each can be
employed as an indicator as a check on the other. Fall is the premier time
for the euro/U.S. dollar to top in its wave pattern, but then it changes as
the wave-pattern falls and a new leader reigns. To be successful at trading
means only to know and fi nd these patterns and understand the structural
changes. Unusual economic times may temporarily disrupt a pattern, but
eventually all markets normalize and revert back to the mean of seasonal
wave patterns.
The caveat to stock price rises and falls is the measurement of equity
prices. For example, how can a 50-point rise in the New Zealand stock mar-
ket be measured? In New Zealand dollar terms, the rise is high, but compared
to U.S. dollar terms the rise is minimal. The same scenario holds with New
Zealand bond and yields. Some wonder why New Zealand
dollar/U.S. dollar doesn’t move much in Wellington trading, and the
answer is sometimes it can’t because rises and falls in stock market, bond, and
yields don’t move enough for change to occur in U.S. dollar terms, but they
are suffi cient for New Zealand dollar terms.
Bonds and yields move currency prices rather than equity markets.
Equity markets are the indication of the overall structure that is measured in
local nation dollars and an insight to bond/yield direction.
The other caveat to New Zealand movement is this market begins a new
trading day and trades by itself for the fi rst few hours of trade.
Many methods exist to measure stock market indices. Some employ
Price to Earnings (P/E) Ratios as measured by Index level/Earnings per
share are equal to Index P/E or dividend yields where yields are equal to
Dividends per share per index level. Others employ a volatility gauge, an
indicator such as a moving average, or mathematical formula such as a
Sharpe Ratio.

Fair Value
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) employs an Index Fair Value
formula:
Index Futures (cid:3) Cash (1 (cid:5) r (x/360)) (cid:2) dividends
The formula encompasses current index level, index dividends, futures days
to expiration, and present interest rates. Fair value is defi ned as futures
priced to cash. A vast majority of index pricing occurs around a fair-value
price (CME).
To calculate:
S&P 500 Futures price (cid:3) 1157.00 pts,
S&P Cash index (cid:3) 1146.00 pts,
interest rates (cid:3) 5.7 percent,
dividends to expiration of futures (cid:3) 3.47 pts converted to S&P Index
pts and factored by addition of dividends in index divided by index
divisor, and
days to expiration of futures (cid:3) 78 days.
Fair Value (cid:3) 1146 (1(cid:5) .057 (78/360)) (cid:2) 3.47 (cid:3) 1156.68
1157.00 – 1156.68 (cid:3) .32 futures overpriced (CME web site example).
S&P 500 Dividend Yield (cid:3) 1.40, convert to
S&P points (cid:3) 1146.00 (cid:4) .0140
(cid:3) 16 pts yearly, 78/360 (CME website example).
Notice the term futures priced to cash. This says in the market or on the
sidelines to hold cash.
Theoretical Fair Value is the relationship between a stock or the index that
comprises that stock, in this instance the Canadian S&P/TSX 60. Theoretical
Fair Value allows a short in one market and long in another. The formula is:
F (cid:3) S (1 (cid:5) (i (cid:2) d) t/365)
where
F (cid:3) Theoretical fair value of futures contract,
S (cid:3) Spot index value,
i (cid:3) interest rate refl ecting cost of funds,
d (cid:3) dividend rate, and
t (cid:3) n umber of days remaining until expiration of the futures contract.

226 Inside the Currency Market
Bonds
Bond markets open before stock markets in many nations. This dynamic
can presage the performance of stock markets. It’s the premier indicator to
determine if a stock market will open up or down, if a trade can run long
or short.
Stock-market openings ensure that currency-pair direction is established,
whether the trade can run, and how far. The method to check this dynamic is
to monitor the interplay of government bonds and yields. U.S. stock markets
that continually rise means bond yields continue to ascend. Stock markets that
range indicate bond prices and yields ebb and fl ow throughout any trad-
ing session or through given periods. And down U.S. stock markets indicate
bond prices are rising. Any one of the three dynamics may mean a trend or
range. And any of the three dynamics represent profi ts.
Anyone can track stock markets around the world from any computer,
from any news service, day and night. Stock prices and market informa-
tion may be delayed by as much as 20 minutes when viewed from an open
computer, real time from a news service. Yet the SIX Swiss Exchange allows
real-time prices to be viewed. The time to really watch is at the time of an
important news announcement in the United States, because all prices rebal-
ance between the two markets.
Bond prices and yields work the opposite way in the world from the U.S.
examples. In the United States, stock markets rise along with yields as bond
prices fall. The opposite scenario holds in other nations. Bond prices are con-
nected to stock market rises and falls and yields move counter. For example,
as the Financial Times and the London Stock Exchange (FTSE) stock index
falls in London trading, so does the government gilt Bond price, while yields
rise. The government gilt bond is then tied to economic performance of the
overall British economy. The British pound/U.S. dollar then falls as the euro/
British pound rises.
The reason for the British pound/U.S. dollar fall is not necessarily the
bond price, although that is important in itself, but the yield may be too high
to borrow in British pound terms along the yield curve. Euro/British pound
is employed then to temper the exorbitant borrowing cost for the premier
currency pair of Great Britain.
Understand the importance of the yield curve in terms of spreads and the
widening, narrowing, and fl attening of curves. All have profound importance
for a currency-pair trade in terms of direction, and it answers the question
how far will a pair travel.

==================================================

Stock and Bond Markets 227
Yields are factored as 0.01is equal to 1/100th of a point. The proper term
is basis point. Bonds are quoted almost the same for most nations, except for
the United States, where it is measured as thirty-seconds of a U.S. dollar.
British gilts are traded on a price basis in 1/100ths with a t (cid:5) 1 settlement
based on actual/actual semi-annual coupons. Prices are clean as opposed to
index gilts, which are dirty priced due to their index link, whose price fl oats.
Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) are traded and quoted based on a
yield basis, while Canada bonds are traded on a price basis in decimals quoted
in hundredths of a point.
Central banks compare, contrast, and calculate each other’s stock mar-
kets, bonds, and yields. The purpose is to measure economic performance
in other nations in terms of infl ation, targets, and gross domestic product
(GDP). Most important is to understand other countries’ economic perfor-
mance in terms of their own borrowing costs, and highlight possible future
scenarios. Central banks are normally far ahead of any yield curve in their
models, calculations, and possible future scenarios. A few examples follow.
Swiss franc, British pound, Australian dollar, and New Zealand dollar
move in their own markets based on sovereign bonds. If, for example, the
British pound/U.S. dollar rises in price during London trade and gilt pur-
chases aren’t matched by the British pound/U.S. dollar buying, the British
pound/U.S. dollar move was false. It lacks trend and confi dence and could be
due to market speculators or possibly from a one-time major purchase in the
spot market by a central bank. Many scenarios exist as to why. The important
takeaway is that trends must have confi dence and conviction backed by inter-
bank instruments to support the spot price. Without support, price moves
are false and can be sold at their peak. This example holds for Swiss franc,
Australian dollar, and New Zealand dollar. Yet it holds for any pair.
Reserve versus Funding Currency Pairs
Before we look into the bond-price yield scenario, it’s important to under-
stand the currency-pair arrangement as it relates to a bond. Currency pairs
are arranged as fi nancing mechanisms to fund cross-border trade, to fi nance
government bonds in whatever nation’s currency, and used as a means for
carry trades.
Carry trades fund one side of a currency pair by selling one interest rate
currency for another. The Japanese yen was the most popular funding cur-
rency over the years, due not only to its low interest rate but continuous

228 Inside the Currency Market
drop in interest rates. The yen was then paired with Australian dollar, British
pound, euro, Swiss franc, U.S. dollar, New Zealand dollar, and Canadian
dollar in this general manner, Australian dollar/Japanese yen. Notice Japanese
yen was always the second part of the equation. In this instance, the Japanese yen
was the funding currency while the fi rst pair in the equation is known as the
reserve.
A low interest-rate currency will always exist to be matched against a
higher interest-rate currency. It’s the nature of the markets in economic terms.
This strategy worked to earn interest for traders and investors, and allowed
cross-border funding to be completed by importers, exporters, major compa-
nies, and governments.
In bond terms, the strategy in the respective market aligned with the
Japanese yen will always be to sell the funding currency and buy the reserve.
A low-yielding currency will always be attached to a higher-yielding currency,
it’s the difference between a successful and nonsuccessful economy. So the
British pound/Japanese yen would always be a buy in London trading, as
stocks in London rise along with gilt prices, and sold as stocks drop along
with gilt prices so the yen will seek its yield. A higher interest-rate currency
will always outperform a low interest-rate currency when matched. But what
if the arrangement was not this simple?
Suppose British pound/Australian dollar was matched against each other
as a misalignment of a funder against a reserve. In this case, Australian dollar
has a 4.50 percent interest rate that rose over the years against 0.50 for the
British pound that dove over the years.
In gilt bond terms, the British pound would always be sold against the
Australian dollar as the U.K. economy deteriorated and the gilt price fol-
lowed. In Australian bond terms and in Australian markets, no reason exists
to buy this pair. It doesn’t serve any of the above purposes. The result has led
to a continuous downtrend for British pound/Australian dollar since 2002.
Yet this represents overall directional trend. It doesn’t mean that quick short-
term gains can’t be earned in up British pound markets as the gilt rises. Gains
will be very short term and they will come quickly, but the possibility exists
to profi t. This strategy goes against trend and it’s never recommended, but
for quick profi ts, it’s always possible because currency-pair prices are always
mobile.
The same scenario applies for euro/Australian dollar. Australian dollar
rates rose as euro rates decreased, so nobody saw a need to ever buy this
pair, so in turn it, too, dropped. But this scenario represents overall direction
and it doesn’t mean possibilities do not exist for example to profi t quickly in
the euro market. In down Australian markets, quick profi t opportunity may

==================================================

Stock and Bond Markets 229
exist, but take profi ts quickly. What if interest rates are closely aligned and
what if much cross-border trade occurs within one pair? British pound/Swiss
franc fi ts this category.
British pound/Swiss franc has a 0.50 percent rate for British pound and
0.25 percent interest rate for Swiss franc, so this represents an excellent trade
in terms of a funding and reserve currency pair to represent a balance. Both
sides of this pair need each other to satisfy cross-border trade rather than an
advantage in interest rates. These pairs represent range trades over a period of
time, as Swiss franc will be bought in up markets on the Swiss Market Index
(SMI) and sold in down markets as Swiss bonds decline. Likewise the British
pound will be bought in up London markets, as British pound will follow the
gilt price up, and sold as the gilt price falls.
What occurs is a range trade until one side or the other changes inter-
est rates one way or another. If one side changes its rates and the other side
doesn’t, a trend situation will occur and disrupt the present balance. The
reserve versus funding structure will then align itself in another manner,
depending on which side changes its rates and in what direction those rates
change. The possibility exists to even drop this pair from funding and reserve
arrangements in favor of another pair more conducive to funding arrange-
ments in interest-rate terms. Currency pairs fall in and out of favor over years
as interest rates rise and fall between nations.
For example, when the Federal Reserve signals that interest rates will
be low for a considerable period in the future, it’s the green light to markets
that the U.S. dollar can be employed as a funding currency against a reserve.
In this instance, sell the U.S. dollar against all other currency pairs just as the
Japanese yen was sold against all its currency pair alignments. With present
low interest-rate environments as exist today, more than a few pairs can be
chosen as a reserve. Until the economic situation changes and interest again
rises, this arrangement will be the market order.
Globex and the Currency Bond/Yield Interplay
Currency pairs once shared the bond price/yield connection between each
other, but the historic connection changed with the introduction of Globex
in 1992 by the CME. It’s a matter of semantics.
For example, when it’s said the U.S. dollar follows a yield or bond price
in another nation, the meaning is actually tied to the Dow or Standard &
Poor’s (S&P) futures price. The semantics changed with the introduction of
Globex.

230 Inside the Currency Market
Globex is an electronic trading system that allows CME products to be
traded after normal U.S. market hours close. Globex allowed world traders
to be connected, trade other markets, and monitor trades from market to
market around the world. More importantly, it allowed the U.S. dollar to be a
free-fl oated instrument when futures and options were introduced along with
the S&P 500 futures contract in 1993 (CME).
The Japanese connected to other world markets when futures began trad-
ing on the Nikkei 225 in 2004. Now Tokyo and U.S. markets had a solid
connection around the clock. The U.S. dollar/Japanese yen relationship then
had a more profound meaning.
No longer was the bond yield connection monitored based on one mar-
ket. It was now monitored between two markets so the meaning and purpose
of yield curves became more pronounced as a gauge to monitor and evaluate
currency pairs. Yet the bond connection became more crystallized as well
when trading of currencies ventured into the retail market.
Retail traders can now connect with other currency markets around the
world with the help of the Globex connection through use of the home com-
puter. The Globex web site now allows interactive charts to be managed by
anyone, as well as an insight into volumes based on futures contracts on the
S&P 500.
New Zealand
The majority of the world watches and reports on New Zealand’s top compa-
nies that comprise the NZX 50 index that trades on the New Zealand Stock
Exchange. Yet the NZX Mid-Cap Index that comprises 35 medium-sized
companies plus the NZX 50 is the better barometer to gauge the health of
New Zealand’s stock market and overall economy. It’s a broader index of com-
panies, therefore a broader index to measure New Zealand’s stock market.
The NZX Group at the NZX issues an operational report every month
that highlights, among other points, trading volumes. September 2010 saw
$2.2 billion of stocks bought compared to $104, 355, 670 in fi xed-interest
instruments better known as debt instruments. June 2010 saw $1,716 million
stocks bought and $133 million in bonds. What is missing in this equation is
the delineation between government and corporate bonds.
The New Zealand Debt Exchange (NZDX) is New Zealand’s bond mar-
ket. The bond market opens for a pre-opening from 8:45 a.m. to 9:00 a.m.
New Zealand time, while the formal market opens at 9:00 a.m. and closes
at 4:45 p.m. This is the opportunity to evaluate trades before the formal

market opens. The New Zealand dollar 11:00 a.m. fi x occurs while the mar-
ket is open. This should be viewed with more importance than stock-
market performance because it establishes the New Zealand price for the
New Zealand market. This aligns the New Zealand dollar to the bond
price. New Zealand government bonds are tied to economic performance of
the New Zealand economy, so in turn is the stock market. A rising bond price
means a rising stock market.
New Zealand’s NZX pre-open is from 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. The NZX
begins at 10:00 a.m. and closes at 4:45 p.m. New Zealand time.
The New Zealand markets do not trade futures, but that will change
in 2011 as index futures and options will begin trade. Whole Milk Powder
futures began trade October 2010 while Skim Milk, Cheese, Milk Fat and
Butter Anhydrous remain in the planning stages. For New Zealand this repre-
sents a huge opportunity, as these products are of profound importance to the
health of New Zealand’s economy. Whole milk powder, Skim Milk Powder

Trade Strategy
New Zealand government bonds are tied to economic performance of the
New Zealand economy. This means that during good economic times bond
prices, along with stock markets, will always rise simultaneously. Currently,
economic performance is fi ne in New Zealand, so evaluate New Zealand
dollar/U.S. dollar in this context. As stock markets rise, the bond price rises
and in turn New Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar will rise. This is a long position
and short when stock markets dive with bond prices
New Zealand stock markets top somewhere in the April to May period.
Historically, April to August see down markets. Up and down markets for

New Zealand generally means two-to-three hundred, even 400 points a
month, on rare occasions.
Measured in New Zealand dollars, when stock markets dive during sum-
mer months in the United States, which is actually winter in New Zealand,
Australian dollar/New Zealand dollar rises. View Exhibit 8.1, a historic chart
of Australian dollar/New Zealand dollar along with Exhibit 8.2, a historic
chart of the NZ 50 stock market.
May is the premier uptrend month for Australian dollar/New Zealand
dollar. A note of caution as this pair is very volatile and the payout is small
in U.S. dollar terms and for U.S. traders. A 100-point gain equates to about
$50 in exchange-rate terms.
Trade the New Zealand markets like this. Down stock markets will see
New Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar down and Australian dollar/New Zealand
dollar up as the government bond price falls along with stock markets.
Australian dollar/New Zealand dollar rises along with New Zealand bond
yields and falling stock markets. This serves for trends and general daily ebbs
and fl ows. Both pairs can be bought and sold continuously as bonds and
yields ebb and fl ow throughout any trading day.

Yet the real measure for direction of New Zealand markets is the S&P
500. When U.S. markets close, New Zealand opens, so New Zealand serves
as a direct connection to the U.S. markets. If U.S. markets close down,
chances are good New Zealand markets will trade down and probably close
down because the S&P 500 futures contract will still refl ect the down U.S.
day. Directional changes occur only if a market event changes the direction.
New Zealand dollar/Japanese yen is another important pair to consider.
Generally, Japanese yen likes bond yields. But like its counterpart Australia,
the New Zealand economy is generally performing well. What does this say
to bonds measured by economic performance and a rising stock market?
It says yields won’t perform quite as well for the Japanese. So look not to sell
New Zealand dollar/Japanese yen, look to buy New Zealand dollar/Japanese
yen for Japanese purposes.

234 Inside the Currency Market
The Japanese would love the yen to be tied to the economic performance
of New Zealand in terms of Japanese yen/New Zealand dollar. It then earns
New Zealand dollars against the yen as the economy continues to perform
well. Both sides of New Zealand dollar/Japanese yen should be considered
before a strategy is implemented. One side will always top as the other pair
bottoms.
Measure New Zealand dollar/Japanese yen against yields between both
nations. As spreads widen, it’s a sell New Zealand dollar/Japanese yen and buy
when spreads narrow. This is a measure of trade and borrowing costs, higher
spreads are more costly. New Zealand dollar spreads narrow when the NZX
is down and the Nikkei 225 is up as Japanese yields will fall and compression
will occur between the two yields. Spreads widen when NZX is up and the
Nikkei is down.
Again the interest-rate disparity with New Zealand and the remaining
nations of the industrialized world must be considered, because capital fl ows
into New Zealand both as investments and as fl ows into New Zealand mar-
kets, which are quite good. The offi cial cash rate (OCR) in New Zealand is
2.75 percent, far above any nation we discuss in this tome except Australia.
So any pair against New Zealand dollar should be sold in New Zealand trad-
ing hours. Pairs such as New Zealand dollar/euro, New Zealand dollar/Swiss
franc, New Zealand dollar/British pound, and New Zealand dollar/Canadian
dollar are all sells, provided the bond-yield scenario holds. In other markets,
present arrangements may or may not work. A reconfi guration of pairs may
be necessary. New Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar should always be a buy-on-dip
strategy, provided economic conditions hold.
What about the British pound/Swiss franc in New Zealand markets? The
answer is why trade it since it doesn’t have a connection to New Zealand or
its markets, nor does the British pound side have a connection because their
markets are not yet opened for trading nor is the Swiss. There is never an
intersection between the two markets.
When New Zealand opens for trading, it trades by itself for about two
hours while the world awaits the ASX opening in Australia. At this time, the
U.S. market closed about two hours prior. U.S. markets will set direction for
New Zealand markets.
Think about the New Zealand dollar 4:00 p.m. fi x and its relation to
other markets. Once New Zealand markets close, the New Zealand dollar
must be priced for other markets, but New Zealand time zones are quite
different. At 4:00 p.m. New Zealand time, New Zealand is ahead of euro
trading in Frankfurt and Swiss franc trading in Zurich by 11 hours, ahead 12
hours for London trading and the British pound. At 4:00 p.m. New Zealand

time, it’s 4:00 a.m. in London. The New Zealand dollar hardly touches the
major European markets. Instead, the Canadian and U.S. markets in terms
of New Zealand dollar/Canadian dollar and New Zealand dollar/U.S. dol-
lar are prime trading times for the New Zealand dollar. Plus British Bankers
Association (BBA) LIBOR is released at 11:00 a.m. London, 11:00 p.m. New
Zealand, after the New Zealand market closes. The LIBOR release at 5:00
a.m. New York time is important to watch for New Zealand dollar direction.
As New Zealand markets close, the New Zealand dollar is no longer tied
to its bond market, so it will seek yields in other markets. The New Zealand
dollar/U.S. dollar will follow S&P direction on Globex until the formal open-
ing of the New York Stock Exchange. Once New York opens, New Zealand
dollar will seek yields in rising New York markets as Treasury Bonds fall. New
Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar is a long in rising New York markets and a short
when the market falls.
Canadian markets open at the same time as New York, so New Zealand
dollar/Canadian dollar could be a viable trade option. As the Toronto Stock
Exchange (TMX) in Canada rises, go long New Zealand dollar/Canadian
dollar as Canadian bonds fall and yields rise, and go short when the Canadian
markets fall. Once New York closes, trade will again come back to New
Zealand and New Zealand dollar will again attach to its bond price.
Australia ASX
Australia’s ASX Stock Market, known formally as ASX Limited, is currently
in merger talks with Singapore’s Stock and Derivatives Exchanges (SGX),
subject to approval by Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board. The
intent is to create the largest exchange in Asia by volume.
Trading begins at pre-market open at 7:00 a.m. Sydney time and a for-
mal opening at 10:00 a.m. Stock orders are entered into the system during
premarket opens with best-priced orders to trade fi rst. The 10:09 a.m. full
opening occurs about the same time as the 10:00 a.m. Australian dollar fi x.
This dual-purpose opening can forecast valuable information as to direction of
Australian dollar/U.S. dollar as well as Australian dollar/New Zealand dollar.
The equity index to view for trading purposes is the S&P/ASX 200 because
it includes only the highest capitalized Australian companies. Approximately
65 percent of the index comprises fi nancial and material companies in the
ASX total listing of 2,192 companies. Yet 78 percent of the index accounts
for total market capitalization. The ASX closes at 4:00 p.m. Sydney time,
midnight in New York. The S&P/ASX 200 index is a market-capitalization

weighted index. The formula: total market capitalization of index stocks
divided by the divisor.
Futures markets that include interest rates, Bank Bills, cash rate, bonds,
swaps, and options begin trade from the second Sunday in March to the fi rst
Sunday in November at 5:14 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. and 8:34 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
From the fi rst Sunday in November to the second Sunday in March, markets
open between 5:08 and 5:14 p.m. to 7:30 a.m. and between 8:30 and
8:34 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. The purpose for the varying times is to coordinate
daylight savings time, especially in the United States, since U.S. Sunday-night
market openings are actually Monday mornings in Sydney. At the Australian
opening, Wellington, New Zealand, trading on the NZX has been open for
three hours.
New Zealand Futures that trade on the ASX open from 5:40 p.m.
to 7:00 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Bank Bills, cash rate, and 3- and
10-year bond futures trade. Yet the bond futures contract is not widely traded
and should be excluded from consideration as an indicator of reference and
instead replaced with the Bank Bills contract as an indicator.
From Exhibit 8.3, the fi ve-year chart of the S&P/ASX200, one would
notice no defi nable pattern exists as to highs and lows from year to year. This
is what it means to tie bonds to economic performance. They’re tied directly
to stock market movements and all movements have pointed straight up over
fi ve years.
Australia is an economy currently performing quite well. As long as
Australia’s economy performs well, no shorts will exist in Australia’s stock
market nor will they exist in Australian dollar/U.S. dollar. Yet this represents
overall trend rather than short-term performance.
If lows for the year will materialize, they will occur somewhere in the
April to August period as new budgets are passed and funded. Any drastic
lows experienced were due to shocks to the world economic system from
2007 to the present day. Australia’s economy absorbed the shocks and
rebounded. This would explain the volatile movements in Australian dollar/
New Zealand dollar to some degree, yet this pair has always traded quite
sporadically.
The ASX never experienced large point swings. Like its counterpart
in New Zealand, 100- or 200-point trading days are rare. Instead 30- or
40-point days are more representative of the ASX. But it’s a market that
trends, so Australian dollar/U.S. dollar will trend.
One measure of risk for the ASX is the new S&P Volatility Index that
began trade September 2010. This volatility index is a VIX index measured
by a weighted average of implied volatility of put and call options on the

ASX 200. No options are listed on the index, it’s a measure of XJO overall
put and call options against the S&P/ASX 200. XJO options are cash settled,
exercised in the European style and are index options over the S&P 200 that
are measured in points rather than Australian dollars. The term XJO is the
formal name of these options.
Generally a high reading implies market uncertainty; some would imply,
probably correctly, an overbought situation, while a low reading implies cer-
tainty. Others would argue it means an oversold market ready to go up. The
volatility index is an end-of-day calculation and is basically the same VIX
Index in purpose, calculation, and measurement that trades on the Chicago
Board of Trade. One difference is 30-day volatility is measured by settlement
prices of puts and calls on the ASX 200 using the RBA overnight rate and
one-, two-, and three-month Bank Bill Reference Rates (BBSW) to interpo-
late the risk-free rate for each maturity.

Trade Strategy
As Australia’s bonds are tied to economic performance, stocks and Australian
dollar/U.S. dollar will continue to rise. Further, as long as interest rates in
Australia continue to rise and continue to be the highest of the industrialized
world, economic performance and money fl ow into Australia and Australia’s
markets will be good. Any dips in Australian dollar/U.S. dollar during
Australia trading hours should always be bought.
Australian dollar/Japanese yen, like its counterpart New Zealand dollar/
Japanese yen, is a sell Japanese yen against Australian dollar during good
economic conditions in Australia. Yet the Japanese would prefer a buy
Japanese yen/Australian dollar so Australian dollars can be earned against
yen. A disparity of interest rates won’t allow this under present economic
conditions. Measure Japanese yen/Australian dollar against Australian
dollar/Japanese yen, as one side will experience a top as the other side bot-
toms. With interest disparities, Australian dollar/Japanese yen is the pre-
ferred trade.
Yet look for compression of both yield curves as a buy and widen-
ing curves as a sell. This is measured against the Nikkei 225. A narrowing
occurs when Australian markets are down and the Nikkei is up. This is a
buy Australian dollar/Japanese yen and sell when Australia is up and the
Nikkei is down.
The rising Australian stock market and healthy economic conditions
with a wide disparity of interest rates says sell any pair against Australian
dollar during Australian trading hours. Pairs such as Australian dollar/British
pound, Australian dollar/euro, Australian dollar/Swiss franc, and Australian
dollar/Canadian dollar are all buy positions, as Australia’s bonds and the ASX
rises and yields fall. Stated differently, these pairs are all long trades as the
ASX rises along with the bond price. In other markets, these arrangements
may or may not have to be reconfi gured.
Once the ASX closes, Australian dollar is not tied to its bond market.
Instead, it will seek its yields in other markets. The S&P 500 should be mon-
itored in terms of Australian dollar/U.S. dollar direction until the formal
opening of New York trading. Once New York opens, Australian dollar/U.S.
dollar is a long, as a rising stock market will send yields up and bond prices
down, and a sell when the stock market falls, as yields fall when the bond
price rises.
Australian dollar/Canadian dollar is a long in rising Canadian markets
as yields will rise when the bond price falls. The monitor for this trade is the
New York markets. If New York markets are up, it lends further confi rmation,

==================================================

Stock and Bond Markets 239
as the TMX has good chances of following rising New York markets. If both
markets are down, sell Australian dollar/Canadian dollar. Be aware of an
interest rate factor in this trade, 4.75 percent against Canada’s 1.00 percent.
A sell trade in down New York and Toronto markets is never long term due to
interest rate differentials. This pair at times is not a major mover, which can
only say not much interest lies in this pair. One reason may be limited trade
between Canada and Australia, or maybe it doesn’t serve as a funding pair.
The last reason may be this pair is a pure commodity pair and its fortunes
may be tied to other factors for its movement such as the CRB Commodity
index.
Australian dollar/British pound is a long in London trading only if the
FTSE is down along with the gilt price as yields rise. The disparity of interest
rates in this confi guration allows this pair to be bought for the long term and
sold as British pound/Australian dollar.
In the Australian dollar/Swiss franc arrangement, both are tied to their
respective bonds in their respective markets. Neither market connects simul-
taneously. After Australia closes, Zurich will eventually open. Either confi g-
uration for this pair poses a problem due to an interest-rate disparity, but
it’s also not a viable trade in terms of risk/reward. For example, the only
method to go long this pair occurs when the SMI is down along with Swiss
Confederate bonds. Australian dollar will rise based on yields. But the Swiss
economy is tied to performance based on a rising bond price. What if the
arrangement was Swiss franc/Australian dollar? This pair loses based on
interest-rate disparity, 0.25 for Swiss franc and 4.50 for Australian dollar.
A long trade in U.S. or Canadian markets would be an option if this Australian
dollar/Swiss franc confi guration was arranged.
FTSE and British Pound
The majority of the world reports and focuses on the FTSE 100 Index
that trades on the London Stock Exchange. This index comprises the best-
capitalized companies that trade on the London Stock Exchange. But it’s the
FTSE 250 Index that serves as the better barometer and measure of health
of the economic situation in England and direction of the British pound
because those 250 companies are more U.K. represented. Point movements
will always be more broad in the FTSE 250 than the FTSE 100.
See Exhibit 8.4, a fi ve-year chart of FTSE 100. The Financial Times
of London always credits this index as its benchmark and this view can be
accepted.

Further, the FTSE 250 allows for a better view of possible tops and bottoms
measured year to year where the FTSE 100 is not clear in that delineation. Yet it
must be understood that at times that measure can be quite diffi cult because the
gilt bond /stock market measure is strictly based on economic performance. Years
of great economic performance can undermine the search for a clear top and bot-
tom. Likewise, years of economic turmoil cannot necessarily presage a rise.
If any period exists to measure a top and bottom year to year, it occurs with
an April/May top that trails off in the summer and builds again in the October/
December period as new budgets are debated and passed. See Exhibit 8.5, the
fi ve-year chart of the FTSE 250. This was measured against a fi ve-year chart of
the FTSE 250 from 2005 to the present. But this measure is not consistent year
over year, as economic performance completely drives this system.

Approximately 2,696 companies trade on the London Exchange as of
August 2010 with an average daily value of approximately $4,127,251,785
(London Stock Exchange). Compare that fi gure to an average daily value
in 1997 of 819,319,487 and one will notice tremendous growth. Part of
that growth is explained by the 2007 merger of Borsa Italiana, Italy’s stock
exchange, new company listings that rose over the years, and a host of new
products introduced. Ironically, stock P/E ratios are not published from com-
pany to company nor is it assumed that P/E ratios are published for the
FTSE 100 or 250, so an overbought or oversold market can’t be determined
by P/E ratios. So this market must be measured in terms of gilt bond prices
and yields.

The base value has been 1000 since its 1984 launch. The index is chain linked

The London Stock Exchange is a market that can move. In May 2007, the
FTSE 100 traded at about 12,203, saw a low of 5,543 during the November
2008 economic crisis, and rose to present-day values of approximately 10,725
(all quoted in British pounds). Plenty of opportunity exists to profi t with
deployment of currency pairs during London trade.
Monthly gilt summaries are released by the London Stock Exchange

non-index-linked gilts. Gilts trade on either the Professional Securities or
Main Market.
The London Stock Exchange advertises itself as the largest debt market
in Europe because of the large number of corporate- and government-debt
issues offered to the trading public. Currently 89 different companies offer
various debt maturities traded on the London Exchange. This lends credence
to the Bank of England’s (BOE) focus in the Quarterly Bulletin on corporate
debt as a measure of future economic health across Europe. More debt issu-
ance usually denotes corporate expansion.
In September 2010, gilts were offered to the retail public for the fi rst time.
gilt purchases and sales fl ow through to the Electronic Order Book for Retail
Bonds on the London Exchange. This allows the public to see two-way con-
tinuous pricing in 49 different gilt maturities. Previously, gilt sales and pur-
chases had high minimum purchase sizes and were for institutional investors
among others.
The London Stock Exchange opens for trading at 8:00 a.m. London
time, 3:00 a.m. New York time and closes at 4:30 p.m. London time, 11:30 a.m.
New York time.
The last two hours of London trade rolls into the fi rst two hours of New
York trading. Further, the last two hours of London trade coincides with the
fi rst two hours of trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange, so British pound/
Canadian dollar becomes an important trade during this time. A 10-minute
auction process begins every trading day in London at 8:00 a.m. and ends at
8:10. The auction process provides vital information as to the direction of the
formal opening.
At the London open, New Zealand and Australia are closed while Tokyo
is closing. Yet Tokyo’s JGB Futures markets remain open for the fi rst three
hours of London trade, and it is vitally important to gauge a British pound/
Japanese yen trade in terms of a yield curve and bond strategy. Be aware that
the close of the three-hour window is the 11:00 a.m. London, 5:00 a.m. New
York time BBA LIBOR announcement. But the 8:00 a.m. London opening is
4:00 p.m. Tokyo. So the close of JGB futures trading rolls into BBA LIBOR
and is an important time to measure the Japanese yen. This time brings vola-
tility due to repricing of assets after the release. Plus U.K. and European
economic announcements are released about this time. This period is one of
the most volatile episodes within a 24-hour trading cycle. It’s a time to profi t,
or to lose if one is not careful.
One hour after the London opening, Frankfurt and Zurich open for
trading, so the euro and Swiss franc become important at this time.

Trade Strategy
The equation to trade the British pound/U.S. dollar is quite simple. As
the FTSE stock market rises, gilt bonds will rise. So in turn will the British
pound/U.S. dollar. How far up depends on bond movements. The short end
is rich with possibilities to measure how far, so this represents the start to
monitor any trade.
Conversely, as the stock market and bond price decline so will the British
pound/U.S. dollar. These equations assume trends. Yet markets may range
trade up and down during a trading session or through periods. This means
bond prices, yields, and the FTSE will ebb and fl ow throughout a trading
day or period of time. It allows for continuous buys and sells throughout the
trading session
Ranging markets simply say bonds, yields, and stock prices fall within
the parameters of their respective prices and are not ready to break new highs
or lows. The British pound/U.S. dollar price will be contained within these
same parameters. A breakout will occur only when the bond/yield equation
breaks its range. If the British pound/U.S. dollar breaks its range without
a bond/yield breakout, British pound/U.S. dollar overshot the range tar-
gets and will fall back inside the range. So if the British pound/U.S. dollar
range was broken on the upside, it’s a sell British pound/U.S. dollar and it’s a
buy if it broke the downside target, provided bonds and yields didn’t break
their range.
Yet the FTSE, bond prices, and yields move well enough on any given
day to easily profi t. Reaction to market movements occurs quickly in London
and Europe, so caution is advised to stay abreast of market action if one trades
short term.
To gauge future movements, compare bond prices to yields. The FTSE
is more than an ancillary indicator due to its focus on exchange rates, so it
should be employed as a measure between bonds and yields.
The overall direction for the British pound/U.S. dollar is always up
toward weakness as good economic conditions are the goal for policymakers
and the BOE. What they seek is a rising bond price with a rising stock mar-
ket. That means a British pound/U.S. dollar headed higher toward weakness.
London trading is quite different from New Zealand and Australia because
movements occur—and sometimes rather quickly.
Remember British pound/U.S. dollar is the premier pair for the BOE,
policymakers, and the general U.K. public due to its connection to the U.S.
economy and as a measure of its own economic health. It’s the pair widely
known, widely viewed, widely understood, and widely reported in the U.K.

for its importance as the vital link. All stock markets report this pair, and
investors watch the U.S. markets with concern to gauge direction of their
own currency pairs, investments, and economic direction. Many world stock
markets stream U.S. news and the New York Stock Exchange averages are
reported directly on respective sites. The world truly watches the U.S. dollar.
Another measure of the British pound/U.S. dollar is the German bund
due to the importance of the German economy as a benchmark indicator of
economic conditions throughout Europe. The approach is to measure yield
spreads between the German bund and the gilt. The question for consider-
ation should always be how much and who benefi ts; which side receives the
better side of the deal in British pound or U.S. dollar terms.
Notice how the British pound/U.S. dollar is confi gured. Both are oppo-
site to each other. Only one side can win on bond terms while the other side
will win in yield terms, but never at the same time. Imagine borrowing in
British pound yields at one price, then paying back the borrowed money
in bunds at a higher bund yield. It’s a losing situation. The bund yield is the
U.S. dollar side of the equation. A few examples follow.
As spreads widen in favor of the German bund, this is a sell British
pound/U.S. dollar because the cost of borrowing in British pound terms is
greater than U.S. dollar terms. The cost is prohibitive in British pound terms
because replication of British pounds can’t be earned, and that must be the
overall goal. If spreads narrow, buy British pound/U.S. dollar as the cost to
borrow decreases. In this instance, it’s the cost of conducting business across
borders that increases or decreases and yields defi ne the terms. As spreads
widen, it says the gilt/bund price widened.
This scenario on a larger scale transpires as spreads widen in favor of
bunds, the British pound/U.S. dollar falls, gilt prices rise, and the FTSE rises
while the opposite scenario holds. As spreads narrow, buy British pound/U.S.
dollar as the FTSE and gilt prices rise. Stated differently, if the German Stock
Index (DAX) in Frankfurt is down and the FTSE is down, buy the British
pound/U.S. dollar, and sell when the DAX is up and the FTSE is up. How
about euro/British pound?
Euro/British Pound
As those same spreads widen, now euros are borrowed and paid back in
British pounds. This is a buy euro/British pound situation. As spreads nar-
row, sell euro/British pound because business will be conducted instead in
British pound/U.S. dollar, the premier currency pair that will earn more

British pounds for the UK. euro/British pound in this instance is the funding
pair, and performed as expected when these pairs were introduced in the lat-
ter part of the 1990s. It was meant to facilitate fi nance across borders when
cost became too high in the premier currency pairs.
In terms of U.K. trading, euro/British pound will always move counter to
British pound/U.S. dollar. If gilt prices and the stock market rise, euro/British
pound will always fall. Conversely, if gilt prices fall along with the stock mar-
ket, euro/British pound will always rise. Euro/British pound as confi gured is
a yield seeker, so it looks for its yields opposite a British pound/U.S. dollar
gilt follower. Euro/British pound is not connected to the bond price nor is it
measured in terms of economic performance, but it can be viewed in its price
term as a measure of economic performance.
A high euro/British pound price in London trading warns that eco-
nomic performance is not healthy so one can note its price in terms of British
pound/U.S. dollar as an overall indicator. Since both move counter to each
other, one pair is always a short while the other pair is always a long. If for
whatever reason both move together, this represents market uncertainty and a
market gift, because one pair will be sold or bought to normalize the market.
The profi t potential can be enormous when market gifts are offered in this
manner. In U.S. dollar terms, euro/British pound pays almost $2 per pip,
better than British pound/U.S. dollar at $1 per pip.
Yet British pound/euro will react quite differently because it becomes tied
to gilts and the FTSE while the euro side attaches perfectly to bund Yields
and the DAX. If the DAX is up in Frankfurt and the FTSE is up in London,
British pound/euro is a clear long, and a clear short if both are down.
The recommendation is to trade pairs during London trading that are
euro, British pound, Japanese yen, or U.S. dollar related and arrange the
pairs based on gilt and yield movements. It is not recommended to trade for
example Australian dollar/Canadian dollar or any unrelated pair attached to
the gilt yield confi guration.
In U.S. trading, British pound of euro/British pound follows the Treasury
bond price up and down while the euro seeks Treasury Yields and follows
yields up and down.
Japanese Yen
As the three-hour time frame ends to trade JGB futures in London trad-
ing, the connection for Japanese yen will switch to Nikkei 225 futures and
Globex will be the measure of direction. Japanese yen in the second part of

==================================================

Stock and Bond Markets 247
the currency-pair equation will connect to the Nikkei for the remainder of
London trading.
The British pound/Japanese yen will then connect as the British pound
to the gilt price and Japanese yen to the Nikkei 225. As yield spreads narrow,
buy British pound/Japanese yen and sell when spreads widen. Spreads narrow
when the FTSE is down and the Nikkei is up. Spreads widen when the FTSE
is up and the Nikkei falls.
U.S. Dollar
The U.S. dollar as the second side of the currency-pair equation can be mea-
sured by the S&P 500, and again Globex is the measure. British pound/U.S.
dollar will be tied to gilts and the U.S. dollar to the S&P 500.
British Pound/Canadian Dollar
Canadian interest rates are currently1.00 percent and Great Britain is 0.50
percent. This present equation is slightly misaligned if this was a trade to
go long. Since the Canadian market is a yield seeker and the British pound
is tied to gilt performance, the only method to go long this pair in the last
two hours of London trading is if the FTSE is down and the Canadian stock
market is down. Spreads would then compress and allow profi ts on the long,
but this trade must be held only for the last two hours of London trade
because the British pound confi guration will change once London trading
closes. The opposite effect also holds. If spreads widen, it’s a clear short, par-
ticularly when the gilt is tied to performance that sends gilt yields down and
the Canadian market seeks yields as the TMX rises. Stated differently, why
would anyone borrow British pounds at 0.50 percent and pay it back at 1.00
percent? The overall trend is down in this confi guration and up as Canadian
dollar/British pound.
British Pound/Swiss Franc
This is an unusual pair, because both are tied to respective bond economic
performance. The British pound present interest rate is 0.50 percent and Swiss
franc is 0.25 percent. Swiss franc in Swiss markets rise when the Domestic
Bond Index, the SBI, rises. If the SBI is up and the gilt price is up along with

the FTSE, go long the British pound/Swiss franc and go short when both fall.
In U.S. markets, the Swiss franc will rise and fall with Treasury bond prices,
while the British pound will rise and fall with bond yields. All three markets
will eventually trade together during a trading day. New York markets will
dominate direction. Due to present interest-rate confi gurations, the overall
trend is buy British pound/Swiss franc and sell Swiss franc/British pound.
British Pound
As London trading closes, British pound will no longer tie to the gilt price.
British pound will then seek yields in Frankfurt, New York, and Canadian
trade. Frankfurt has one hour of trade remaining, so the Canadian and New
York markets become the best trade opportunities for British pound.
In Canadian markets, British pound/Canadian dollar would work well.
As the TMX rises on the Toronto Exchange and Canadian bonds fall, yields
will rise. This is a long British pound/Canadian dollar, provided London is
closed and the gilt connection is broken. If London is open and the FTSE
and TMX are up, British pound/Canadian dollar is an easy long trade.
For U.S. markets, as the New York market is up, yields will rise and bond
prices will fall. This sends British pound/U.S. dollar up, and down when New
York markets are down with yields as the bond price rises.
Japanese Nikkei 225 and TOPIX Indices
As can be expected, the Japanese are quite different in their methodology and
calculation of their stock indices, the TOPIX and Nikkei 225, because both
are light years apart and have various meanings.
The world reports and focuses on the Nikkei 225 because it is calcu-
lated in yen while the Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX indices), are factored
in point terms. TOPIX indices are calculated by the Tokyo Stock Exchange
while the Nikkei is calculated by Nihon-Keizai Shimbun, a popularly read
newspaper in Japan distributed by Nikkei Digital Media. TOPIX indices are
free-fl oat adjusted with a market capitalization weight while the Nikkei is an
average-price weight where higher-priced stocks impact the index.
The Nikkei is comprised of 225 top Japanese companies while TOPIX
indices are multi-faceted indices that comprise the TOPIX, 30, 70, 100, 500,
and 1000 and include economic sectors such as the TOPIX Transportation
index, Bank index, Energy, and Electric appliances to name a few of the many

that exist. The Nikkei comprises 225 companies, while total TOPIX compa-
nies include 1700 traded on the TSE. The BOJ and Japanese Government
focus on TOPIX to gauge economic conditions, while the Nikkei is never
considered. This means the Nikkei 225 is a market measure while the TOPIX
is an economic measure for policymakers. The Nikkei 225 in yen traded out-
side Japan for about 20 years while Nikkei 225-U.S. dollar terms was intro-
duced in 2004. Both trade on the CME.
The TSE opens at 9:00 a.m. and closes at 3:00 p.m. Tokyo time. Futures
trading on the TSE holds the same hours, except evening trading in JGBs from
3:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. From 11:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., the exchange is closed
for lunch, but consideration is under way to extend lunch for one hour.
Tokyo openings represent a one-hour trade difference between Sydney
and Tokyo so pairs such as Australian dollar/Japanese yen should be evalu-
ated. Wellington, New Zealand, represents a four-hour difference, so New
Zealand dollar/Japanese yen should also be evaluated before or during Tokyo
trade. The three-hour JGB extended opening allows JGBs to be carried over
and traded for the fi rst three hours of London trade. This allows Japanese yen
to be priced in London and Frankfurt markets.
The overall trend for the Nikkei has been down since 2005 due to
horrid economic circumstances. Consider a few examples from the TSE
2010 Fact Book.
Currently, stock dividends are taxed at 10 percent with a scheduled 10 percent
increase in 2012. Capital gains are currently taxed at 10 percent with a
10 percent increase scheduled in 2012. Three percent of the 10 percent tax is
an inhabitant tax that is standard across all prefectures. JGBs have a separate
and equally abusive tax. That explains why the majority of Japanese trading
occurs from offshore accounts outside of Japan. Overall the Japanese economy
has been in an economic slump since the Asian crisis in the late 1990s and has
not experienced good times since.
If any seasonal trend exists year to year, April is always a down month
while May experiences ups. It’s not unusual to see 80, 100, even 150 point
days for the Nikkei 225.
The JGB Futures 5- and 10-year contract and the 5- and 10-year options
contract is the only instrument to gauge the U.S. dollar/Japanese yen rela-
tionship because the Japanese lack an actively traded bond market.
The Nikkei Index was fi rst calculated in 1950. All stocks represent the
full spectrum of the Japanese economy and are equally weighted in the index.
Today’s criteria is a 50-yen par value. To calculate: divide the sum of stock prices
of Nikkei 225 stocks by a divisor. Round two digits after the decimal point to
calculate the average. The divisor in September 2010 was currently 24.869 and

is regularly published by Nikkei. The divisor is the trigger, the guide that holds
the index steady in light of stock splits, additions, or subtractions of stocks.
Trade Strategy
In the U.S. dollar/Japanese yen arrangement, the Japanese yen is a yield
seeker while Japanese yen/U.S. dollar sees Japanese yen as a bond follower.
This is a tricky arrangement for the Japanese. With U.S. dollar/Japanese yen,
as the Nikkei rises, bond futures will fall, and bond yields will rise along with
the U.S. dollar/Japanese yen. Japanese yen/U.S. dollar works opposite. As the
Nikkei falls, bonds rise, yields fall, and the Japanese yen/U.S. dollar rises.
The preferred arrangement for the Japanese is Japanese yen/U.S. dollar in
Japanese trading, yet that means stock market falls hinder their companies as
well as overall economic conditions. It’s a precarious situation for the Japanese
and made more precarious by a call rate of 0.10 and a falling U.S. dollar.
One can understand the move for the Japanese to establish overseas for their
fortunes. Fundamentally, both pairs should be evaluated in terms of bonds
and yields. Yet a tracker is the Nikkei 225 in yen and Nikkei 225 in US dollar
terms. One should rise as the other falls. Both trade on the CME.
The British pound/Japanese yen will perform best as a buy when Japanese
bond future prices rise and gilt prices fall as the spread narrows, and sold
when the spread widens.
This scenario holds for Australian dollar/Japanese yen and New Zealand
dollar/Japanese yen. If New Zealand markets are down and the Nikkei 225
rises, yield spreads will narrow, so buy New Zealand dollar/Japanese yen
and sell when the reverse occurs because spreads will widen. The same sce-
nario holds for Australian dollar/Japanese yen. Yet refrain from pairs such
as Canadian dollar/Japanese yen, Australian dollar/Canadian dollar, and
Australian dollar/Swiss franc during Japanese trading as no need exists to
trade these pairs due to limited cross-border trade. These pairs should be
traded during their respective markets or in New York trading hours.
Deutsche Boerse DAX, STOXX, Bunds, and the Euro
What is known as the Xetra Dax 30 that trades on the Deutsche Boerse,
formerly known as the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, is comprised of DAX as
an index to measure stock prices and Xetra is the electronic trading system

employed by market professionals to report DAX movements. DAX is actu-
ally a family of indices such as the MDAX—comprised of 50 medium sized
German and foreign companies, TEC DAX—comprised of 30 of Germany’s
largest tech companies, and SDAX—comprised of 50 German small-cap
companies, to name a few.
The Deutsche Boerse actually calculates approximately 2700 indices
daily, the vast majority comprise DAX indices for other global markets such
as volatility indices, strategy indices, short stock indices, and real estate
indices. Domestically, DAX indices comprise 18 economic sectors and nine sub-
sectors that include fi nancials, utilities, and consumer goods to name a few.
This methodology is the same as the Japanese format. The format allows an
economic assessment to be rendered sector by sector by government offi cials
and market professionals.
Yet the world reports and focuses on the DAX 30 because it was the
fi rst to form in the index family in 1988. It’s the index closely aligned to the
German bund price and yield, and approximately 50,000 fi nancial products
are tied to the index (Boerse Reports). But the HDAX can be viewed as a
more informative indicator to measure economic performance, a benchmark,
because it comprises 110 companies contained in DAX, MDAX, and TEC
DAX. Ninety-fi ve percent of total market capitalization comprises HDAX
(Boerse).
The Dax 30 is a free-fl oat index calculated every second using a Laspeyres
formula with a 1987 base value of 1000. Prices are quoted in euros and
reported on the Deutsche Boerse web site in close to real time, so a trad-
ing decision can be evaluated quickly. Approximately 134,154 domestic
and 54,055 foreign equities trade on the Boerse. The 2009 annual report
states approximately 10,000 to 15,000 equity trades occur per month, for a
167,270,994 yearly total with a total turnover of 2,222,071 and 90 percent
handled through Xetra.
Xetra is the premier electronic trading platform for the Deutsche Boerse,
where a vast majority of trades are handled from many European exchanges
such as derivatives, futures, and options traded on Eurex, Scoach Schweiz
derivatives and fl oor transactions on the Boerse. Consider the 2009 annual
report that states 341,000 certifi cates and warrants, 3,000 retail funds, 547
index funds, 10,000 securities, 26,000 fi xed income, and 380,000 trade-able
instruments trade through Xetra. Total 2009 trading volume equaled euro
1,163.3 billion, with 167.3 million transactions conducted without failure.
All trades are conducted with precision and effi ciency. This exchange is well
managed in all aspects of its operations.

A 2010 study was under way to improve the speed of Xetra. Currently,
Xetra handles a million quotes a second in under one millisecond per quote.
It is a fast-moving and sophisticated market.
The Deutsche Boerse opens for trading at 9:03 a.m. and closes at 5:45 p.m.
Frankfurt time, 3:00 a.m. to noon New York time with a one-hour dif-
ference during U.S. daylight savings. This time is referenced to the close
of Xetra. Floor trading continues until 8:00 p.m. Frankfurt, 2:00 p.m.
New York. This time would coincide with the close of futures trading on
the CME.
London has been trading for one hour when the DAX opens, and closes
one hour before Frankfurt while Australia, New Zealand, and Tokyo are
closed. The caveat is this methodology follows New York EST. The last two-
and-a-half hours of Frankfurt trading coincide with the fi rst two-and-a-half
hours of New York and Toronto Stock Exchange trading. Euro/Canadian
dollar is an important consideration during this period. All will follow
U.S. dollar up or down in London and Frankfurt trading, so the S&P 500
will be the measure for U.S. dollar.
See Exhibit 8.6, the fi ve-year DAX 30 chart and notice April down
months with a trend that develops in August and trends to the end of the
year. This period begins the yearly euro/U.S. dollar top during the November-
December period.

German Bunds
There are two methods to track German bunds. Eurex links spot and futures
markets through electronic trading of bunds and iBoxx indices. iBoxx indices
comprise two benchmarks for the euro and British pound bond markets,
iBoxx and iBoxx consolidated. Both were the fi rst indices developed to track
the European bond market. iBoxx trades gilts and bunds while iBoxx consoli-
dated determines spreads to measure yield curves. Yield-curves data are based
on actual and updated market bid/ask spreads.
The benchmark German bund is the 10-year, and is employed as a com-
parison to other nations’ yield curves to determine direction for the euro
and other fi nancial instruments. Yet it’s not an imperative for the 10-year to
be employed for trading decisions. German and other bonds can be viewed
on Eurex, accessible directly from the Deutsche Boerse web site. Here bund
prices, turnover, and volume can be viewed almost in real time.
Euro Trade Strategy
German bund yields follow the DAX in up markets and down in falling
markets while the bund price moves in opposite directions. To trade the euro/
U.S. dollar, follow German bund yields.
As the DAX is up along with bund yields, the euro/U.S. dollar will go up, a buy
the euro/U.S. dollar. Sell the euro/U.S. dollar when the DAX is down along with
bund yields. The U.S. dollar side follows the German bund price up and down.
While this statement may be correct and can be employed as an evalua-
tive tool, the S&P 500 is the better measure because it can determine overall
DAX and U.S. dollar movements until the New York Stock Exchange opens.
The euro will always outpace the U.S. dollar side due to buying and selling
of the euro either in the spot market or through other fi nancial instruments
connected to the euro such as futures and options. A number of measures
exist to ensure euro direction.

The STOXX 50 is an index comprised of 50 of the biggest Blue Chip
European companies. The DAX will move in the same direction as the
STOXX 50. The SDAX is a measure of short DAX positions in the DAX 30.
It’s correlated 99.89 percent with the DAX 30 (Deutsche Boerse). All indices
can be viewed directly on the Deutsche Boerse web site.
The Germans measure the DAX and other equity indices based on
further DAX indices termed DAX Plus that are known as strategy indices.
As free-fl oat indices such as the DAX 30, it doesn’t measure risk. The current
Deutsche Boerse newsletter outlines one such risk strategy.
The DAX Plus Maximum Sharpe Ratio is a measure of excess return to
risk calculated using standard deviation. Sharpe Ratios are defi ned as
S(X) (cid:3) (R (cid:2) R)/ Standard deviation of X
b t
where
X (cid:3) investment,
R (cid:3) average rate of return of X,
b
R (cid:3) best rate of return of a risk-free asset, and
t
standard deviation X (cid:3) standard deviation of Rb.
Since standard deviation is the square root of the variance that measures risk,
measure the variance of DAX 30 using the DAX Plus minimum variance.
A high variance means volatility will increase which is measured against the
DAX Plus Risk Trigger index. This methodology says as volatility rises, equity
prices will fall and vice versa. This is a sell euro/U.S. dollar as volatility rises.
In simple terms, Sharpe Ratios using standard deviation, say, as a stock’s
return varies from the average return, the more volatile is the stock or the
fi nancial instrument as the measure. Sharpe Ratios were used to measure two
portfolios against each other.
During Frankfurt trading, British pound/U.S. dollar is locked into the
gilt price while Australian dollar/U.S. dollar and New Zealand dollar/U.S.
dollar will follow bund yields up and down along with the DAX 30 and the
euro/U.S. dollar.
Euro/Japanese yen, Australian dollar/Japanese yen, and New Zealand
dollar/Japanese yen will always be questionable due to the Japanese side of
the equation. Measure Japanese yen based on the Nikkei 225.
For euro/Japanese yen, sell when spreads widen between the Nikkei 225
and the DAX 30 and buy when spreads narrow. If the DAX is down and
the Nikkei rises, buy euro/Japanese yen because yield spreads narrowed. If the
DAX is up and the Nikkei falls, sell euro/Japanese yen because yield spreads
widened and the cost to borrow is too high.

==================================================

256 Inside the Currency Market
It appears Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar lack a connection to
European markets, yet this is not the case and will be addressed in the next
chapter. For now, the Nikkei 225 is the measure against Australian dollar/
Japanese yen and New Zealand dollar/Japanese yen, and know that Australian
dollar and New Zealand dollar trade in London and Frankfurt to seek yields.
The purpose of Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar is to earn reserves
for their economy when trading outside their own markets.
So again measure the euro/U.S. dollar to the DAX and S&P. Both mar-
kets move in the same fashion, rising stock markets means rising yields and
falling bond prices. A rising DAX is euro/U.S. dollar -supported in Frankfurt
markets and may mark trends. Both stock markets can be measured against
the euro/U.S. dollar to determine a support or resistance level.
If both markets are up, go long the euro/U.S. dollar and go short if both
markets are down. If the DAX is up and the S&P is down, it is still euro/U.S.
dollar-supported because the euro is the home nation. If the DAX is down
and the S&P is up, watch the euro/U.S. dollar for direction heading into
New York markets. Normally the S&P provides overall direction. The same
scenario would work for the British pound/U.S. dollar as it closely follows
the euro/U.S. dollar.
As the DAX formally closes, the euro will fi nd direction in U.S. markets
by following yields in rising U.S. stock markets as the Treasury bond falls. So
euro/U.S. dollar is a buy in rising markets and a sell in falling markets.
Euro/Canadian Dollar
This pair has equal interest rates at 1.00 percent and Frankfurt trades its last
two-and-a-half hours into the fi rst hours of trade in Toronto that opens at
9:30 a.m. New York time. If the DAX and the TMX in Toronto are both up,
euro/Canadian dollar is a clear long, and a sell when both markets are down.
If U.S. markets are up, it’s a further indication for this pair to go long. Yet if
the U.S. market is up, Frankfurt is closed, and the Canadian market is up, it’s
still a clear long, and a sell when both are down.
Euro/Canadian dollar should never be reconfi gured under present inter-
est rate-conditions and under the present perfect two-market arrangements.
Both sides of this pair seek yields in their respective markets and both sides
will fi nd them easily when both markets are up. If economic circumstances
change for the better among both pairs and interest rates remain the same,
euro/Canadian dollar will fl y up. Only a change of interest rates that favors
one side or another can change the present balance.

In terms of U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar, euro/Canadian dollar goes long
and rises as U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar goes short. Combine the pairs, and
the equation becomes Canadian dollar/Canadian dollar and euro/U.S. dollar.
Canadian dollar becomes either short with euro/Canadian dollar or long with
U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar or vice versa.
Euro/Swiss Franc
This is a tricky pair for many reasons. Both the Swiss National Bank (SNB)
and european Central Bank (ECB) have huge interests in this pair, but both
have interests in opposing confi gurations. The Swiss want Swiss franc/euro to
rise while the ECB want euro/Swiss franc to rise. Both markets pull against
each other and that continues in U.S. markets.
One reason is the DAX rises on yields while the SMI stock index that
trades on the SIX Swiss Exchange is tied to Confederate bonds and both are
tied to economic performance. This equation seems quite simple but it will
not work in every instance with this pair.
It’s not the euro side that’s complicated but rather the Swiss franc side.
So it’s important to view Confederate and Bund futures on the SIX Swiss
Exchange web site. bund and Confederate futures are the key indicator, more
so than the SMI. The web site actually provides all the necessary informa-
tion to trade this pair in real time and all is provided as market indicators.
Interesting about this pair is it can be a big mover because the payout is big
in U.S. dollar terms. Yet if the matrix is understood between the two markets,
it’s an easy pair to trade.
So to trade this arrangement as the DAX rises, bund prices fall, and yields
rise along with the euro. The SMI needs to rise along with the SBI in order
for the Swiss franc to rise. If the DAX falls and the SMI falls, spreads com-
press so this might be the long trade opportunity. If Confederate and bund
futures rise, euro/Swiss franc is a short.
The Swiss SMI is not an essential element in this equation because the
SMI can rise while the SBI Index is down. SBI and Confederate futures is
the essential element for the Swiss franc side. Both or either must rise in order
for Swiss franc to rise. This can be tricky on some days, so caution is advised.
If problems arise while in a trade and it doesn’t work as expected, bail out and
wait for a better day. Those problems lie in the push and pull of both central
banks’ interests and the exchange rate element in the SMI calculation.
In U.S. markets, euro will follow Treasury yields up and down and
Swiss franc will follow Treasury bond prices up and down. Rising U.S.

stock markets sends Treasury yields up and Treasury bond prices down. U.S.
markets will dictate direction in all three markets once New York trading
formally opens.
The methodology for U.S. trade is view euro/Swiss franc the same as
euro/U.S. dollar. Because U.S. dollar/Swiss franc is an opposite pair to euro/
Swiss franc, they will move in opposite directions. Swiss franc/U.S. dollar is
another confi guration that moves in opposite directions as euro/Swiss franc.
In Swiss franc/euro terms, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc and Swiss franc/U.S. dollar
would both run counter to Swiss franc/euro. The overall strategy should be
watch euro/Swiss franc because it’s a forward indicator to euro/U.S. dollar
due to interest for both central banks to employ it for cross-border trade
rather than a speculative investment.
SIX Swiss Exchange
The SMI is the widely reported and popularly known index that marks direc-
tion for all stocks traded on the SIX Swiss Exchange. The SMI comprises 20
of Switzerland’s biggest companies. Yet the SMIM is a broader index that
includes 30 of Switzerland’s largest mid-cap companies. A total of 256 shares
trade on the SIX Swiss Exchange, represented by the All Share Index.
All stock indices operate based on a Laspeyres index, a free fl oat that is
calculated every second by dedicated market professionals at the SIX Swiss
Exchange. The formula is:

traded. The index is termed the SBI Domestic. Only Swiss Government fi xed
interest-rate bonds with maturities 12 months or longer with Swiss franc
$100 million comprise the index. The SBI is calculated based on a Laspeyres
capital-weighted index.
The SBI 52-week high and low ranged from 110.82 to 119.96 with a
daily high and low that ranged from a low of 117.96 and high of 118.11
(SIX Swiss). Daily movements in this range do not speak volumes about
stock market ranges.
To monitor the SMI, a volatility index was introduced in 2005 called the
VSMI. Volatility is based on SMI 30-day options traded on Eurex. The index
is calculated based on a Sharpe Ratio as trades enter the Eurex system. The
calculation is:

High volatility says the SMI price is high and low volatility implies the index
is low.
Bond trading begins at 8:30 a.m. Zurich time, 2:30 a.m. New York time
and closes at 5:30 p.m. Zurich, 11:30 a.m. New York. The 8:30 a.m. opening
includes a two-minute randomized opening. If bond prices with maturities
less than 15 years deviate 1 percent in price at the opening, trade is stopped
for 15 minutes. If bond prices with more than 15-year maturities deviate
3 percent in price, trade is halted for 15 minutes. The SIX Swiss Exchange
opens at 9:00 a.m. and closes at 5:30 p.m., which is 3:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m.
New York time.
At the Swiss opening, Australia, New Zealand, and Tokyo are closed.
The SIX Swiss Exchange closes 30 minutes before the close at the Frankfurt
Exchange. The London close occurs simultaneously with the SIX Swiss
Exchange. The last two hours of Swiss trading coincide with the fi rst two hours
of the New York Stock Exchange trading as well as the Toronto Stock Exchange.
SIX Swiss Exchange Trading Services
On the SIX Swiss web site are a number of useful trading services that deserve
mention. The bond calculator offers an option to determine yields based on
price and price based on yields to include accrued interest. A bond can be
factored based on maturity, coupons, settlement, price, and day counts.
Charts allow charting of the Swiss markets in terms of equities, bonds,
and indices. A charting comparison between markets is offered as well.

A sophisticated colored heat map allows individual stocks, sectors, indus-
tries, and stock indices to be viewed in terms of different periods, volume,
and turnover not just for present trading periods but historical markets as
well. It’s valuable as a measure of the Swiss markets.
An updated exchange rate table along with the ability to measure U.S.
dollar and cross pairs in terms of an interactive conversion table is offered.
This may appear simplistic on the surface, but exchange rates must be
measured in terms of the larger picture of worldwide traders and market
professionals.
Resident U.S. traders may fi nd no value in an Australian dollar/New
Zealand dollar trade because the number of Australian dollar/New Zealand
dollar converted into U.S. dollars is quite small. Yet the exchange rate may
be suffi cient in Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar terms and for
Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar resident traders who may fi nd
profi t. Japanese traders may fi nd profi t in, say, British pound pairs. All cur-
rency pairs have a different payout depending on exchange rates and the
conversion factors in whatever currency, according to the particular world
market.
Switzerland Confederate Bonds
Confederate Bonds are tied to economic performance of the Swiss economy
and serve as the benchmark for trade of Swiss franc.
Trade Strategy
U.S. dollar/Swiss franc and Swiss franc/U.S. dollar can be tricky trades. The
SBI Domestic Bond Index provides the most important indicator in terms of
direction for both pairs. Typically, when the SBI and SMI are up Swiss franc/
U.S. dollar is up and U.S. dollar/Swiss franc is down, a long and a short. The
SMI is an ancillary indicator in this equation, and doesn’t necessarily correlate
directly with the SBI. Yet both are by far the most widely traded instruments
on any given Swiss trading day. The tricky aspect occurs when the SMI is
up, say, 10 points and the SBI can actually trade in negative territory. This
can send U.S. dollar/Swiss franc and Swiss franc/U.S. dollar in quite differ-
ent directions. For this reason, the SBI is the key guide. Confederate Bond
futures play a role of almost equal importance.
Typically, the SBI and Confederate Futures follow each other, sometimes
not. Confederate Bond futures sometimes follow German bund futures,



==================================================

==================================================

Stock and Bond Markets 261
sometimes not. To navigate, employ SBI as the overall guide because SMI
again fails as an overall correlational tool. When the SBI is up, Swiss franc/
U.S. dollar is up and U.S. dollar/Swiss franc falls. Better to trade the Swiss
franc/U.S. dollar confi guration in Swiss markets. Euro/Swiss franc will typi-
cally follow the direction of U.S. dollar/Swiss franc, while Swiss franc/euro
will not. Caution is advised in Swiss markets because sometimes trades are
easy and other days they are not. The SMI web site allows a full view of the
SMI, SBI, Confederate, and bund Futures to be viewed on one screen.
In U.S. markets, Swiss franc in U.S. dollar/Swiss franc will follow
Treasury bond prices up and down while U.S. dollar will follow yields. As
the U.S. stock market rises, yields will rise and the bond price will fall. When
both markets trade together, U.S. markets provides direction to U.S. dollar/
Swiss franc and Swiss franc/U.S. dollar and also provide direction to Swiss
markets in terms of the SBI.
Go long U.S. dollar/Swiss franc when U.S. markets are down and short
when markets rise. Go long Swiss franc/U.S. dollar when U.S. markets rise
and short when U.S. markets fall.
Euro in euro/Swiss franc follows Treasury bond yields while Swiss franc
follows Treasury bond prices, so some continuity exists from market to mar-
ket to some degree for this pair. It’s another reason euro/Swiss franc can be
employed as the premier risk indicator. The question for euro is risk to follow
yields or safety of bond prices by Swiss franc. It’s a gauge of a market that
seeks risk or safety, caution against risk.
British pound/Swiss franc in U.S. markets trades as British pound is the
Treasury yield seeker while Swiss franc follows the bond price. Negative U.S.
stock markets will see British pound fall as Swiss franc rises and vice versa.
The best opportunity for British pound/Swiss franc is go long in rising U.S.
markets, short when markets drop because of the British pound dominance
in interest rates and movements over Swiss franc.
Australian dollar/Swiss franc and New Zealand dollar/Swiss franc have
possibilities in U.S. markets only as a long trade and only if U.S. stock mar-
kets rise because of the wide disparity in interest rates between these two
pairs. Both pairs are long trends due to the disparity of interest rates.
In terms of DAX comparisons, one must triangulate the pairs. Euro/
U.S. dollar and U.S. dollar/Swiss franc is actually euro/Swiss franc if U.S.
dollar is cancelled. U.S. dollar works as a cancellation because Swiss franc
becomes the U.S. dollar measure in terms of market risk for both pairs.
A long euro/U.S. dollar is a short U.S. dollar/Swiss franc and vice versa. Euro
seeks yields in terms of bunds and yields in terms of U.S. Treasuries. It’s a
pure risk indicator as opposed to Swiss franc as a pure measure of safety as

it follows Confederate bonds, U.S. bonds, and German bonds. What if euro/
Swiss franc was measured as euro/U.S. dollar and Swiss franc/U.S. dollar?
This is actually a proper arrangement of the pairs because equal positions are
held in terms of the bond-yield confi guration. The fi nal analysis is still euro/
Swiss franc as a measure, because the SMI sometimes fails as an indicator.
Toronto Stock Exchange
The TMX Group operates the Toronto Stock Exchange to trade stocks,
the Montreal Exchange to trade Canadian derivatives, the Boston Options
Exchange to trade equity options electronically, and the Natural Gas Exchange
to trade and clear natural gas contracts.
The S&P/TSX 60 is the primary equity index that covers 73 percent of
total equity capitalization. The S&P/TSX Composite is a broader market
measure that includes common stock and income trust units. Income trust
units are defi ned as an equity type investment structured to distribute cash
fl ows in a tax effi cient manner. Currently 155 are traded, that includes 92
business trusts, 13 energy trusts, 38 real estate investments trusts, and 12
power and pipeline trusts. Income unit trusts are employed as a corporate
formation in Canada to allow the development of Canada’s natural resource-
rich commodities such as gold, minerals, oil sands, mining, oil, and gas and
natural gas. Dividend yields have been known to be quite high over the years,
especially as underlying trusts became full-fl edged companies.
The S&P/TSX Composite is a comprehensive measure of equities in
terms of the S&P/TSX 60, S&P/TSX equity, and S&P/TSX Completion
Indices.
In October 2010, the S&P/TSX VIX index was launched to measure
30-day volatility of the S&P/TSX 60 equity index. The index is derived
from near- and next-term options on S&P/TSX 60. The Canadians employ
CORRA and CDOR one-, two-, and three-month rates to interpolate risk-
free rates for each maturity.
The Montreal Exchange is a sophisticated and well-managed trading
forum for options, futures, interest rate, equity indices, yield curve spreads,
and swap hedges. The guides and strategies section is a fabulous tool as a
learning guide into Canadian fi nancial traded instruments.
Can Deal reports Canadian Treasury and bond prices in terms of a bid
and ask price, a bid and ask yield, and price changes throughout any trading
day directly on the Toronto Stock Exchange web site. This is most important
to trade the Canadian dollar. The Canadian bond market opens at 8:00 a.m.

same as the United States.
Standard and Poor’s, a company formed in 1941 by the merger of
Standard Statistics Corporation and Poor’s Publishing, calculates all Canadian
stock indices. The TSX is factored by dividing the total fl oat-adjusted market
capitalization of index stocks by a divisor. Float adjusted are publicly traded
shares. An investable weight factor (IWF) is employed. For each stock IWF is
equal to available fl oat shares divided by total shares outstanding.

The divisor is not released for public consumption.
Trade Strategy
The Canadian market trades as the TSX rises, and bond prices fall while
bond yields rise. This combination sends Canadian dollar up toward weak-
ness, a long position. So Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar would work in rising
Canadian markets while U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar is a short because Canadian
dollar’s confi guration was changed to refl ect the bond price rather than
the yield.
The Canadian arrangement will always be tricky because both the U.S.
and Canadian markets refl ect yields as both stock markets rise and bond
prices fall. One side must refl ect a bond price while another must refl ect
the yield. The question on any trading day is which combination works. The
determination can be tricky.
U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar won’t work as a long if Canadian markets rise
and U.S. markets fall. A short is a questionable arrangement. If both markets
fall, short U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar. If both market rise, long Canadian
dollar/U.S. dollar, so trade the Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar arrangement.
This is the proper order, not necessarily perfect, but U.S. dollar attaches to a
bond price while Canadian dollar attaches to its yield. The Canadian market

must be thought about fi rst before a trade strategy is implemented, yet U.S.
markets may provide overall direction.
In interest-rate terms, Canadian dollar rates are 1.00 percent while U.S.
dollar is 0.25 percent. The longer term says Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar is the
preferred combination as a longer-term long trade. Yet interest-rate dispari-
ties should always arrange as the dominant rate in the fi rst position of any
currency-pair arrangement.
Due to the unique Canadian dollar yield arrangement and pres-
ent interest-rate disparities against other pairs, normal Canadian dollar
confi gurations will be strange. For example, see the euro/Canadian dollar.
Canadian dollar rates are 1.00 percent as opposed to euro 1.00 percent.
But both are yield seekers. When the DAX and TSX both rise, how
should pair arrangement work? To some degree, it’s long without looking
back unless either side changes its rates and provided economic condi-
tions hold steady or improve. Australian dollar/Canadian dollar and New
Zealand dollar/Canadian dollar have the same arrangement in U.S. and
Canadian trading. Both pairs seek yields, so it’s again long under present
confi gurations.
Canadian dollar/Swiss franc in present form works fi ne. Go long Canadian
dollar/Swiss franc in rising Canadian markets, especially because Canadian rates
are 1.00 percent and Swiss rates are 0.25 percent.
The Canadian dollar is a yield seeking currency, which classifi es it as
a risk asset. Risk assets can only be traded against measures of risk such as
the new Volatility Index. High volatility is normally a sign of high risk or
overbought conditions, while low volatility represents oversold conditions
with low risk. The Canadian dollar should be traded based on rises and falls
of the TSX with volatility as the overall guide to determine direction. Based
on its yield nature, the Canadian dollar will always be a funny-moving pair
even loony at times. Add the vast amounts of corporate oil interest in this
pair who wish to lock in a particular price, and prices can at times become
really loony.
New York Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange and Euronext combined in 2007 to form
New York Stock Exchange, Euronext which claims 8000 varying fi nancial
instruments traded, including derivatives, futures, options, stocks, and stock
indices. Two most important instruments to trade currency pairs are the Dow
Jones and S&P indices. Both are important, yet very different in calculation,
methodology, size, and age.

Charles Dow calculated the Dow 12 stocks in 1896 while Standard Statistics
Corporation fi rst introduced the S&P 90 in 1926, S&P 500 in the 1950s (DJ
Indexes, S&P). Dow indices are price weighted while S&P are market-capitaliza-
tion weighted (DJ Indexes, S&P). Dow indices represent only blue chips while
S&P are the largest capitalization companies, at least $3.5 billion by Standard
& Poor terms. Dow 30 captures about 25 to 30 percent of the market while
the S&P 500 covers about 75 percent (DJ Indexes, S&P). Dow Jones offers the
Dow 30 and Composite 65 while the S&P offers S&P 100, Mid Cap 400, Small
Cap 600, and S&P 1500 that comprises S&P 500, 400, and 600 (DJ Indexes,
S&P). All indices are represented by U.S. companies and calculated in U.S. dol-
lars. Dow Jones indices update every two minutes on the NYSE web site, S&P
are time delayed by 20 minutes. Both indices are calculated within seconds.
Both companies offer Treasury bond indexes to track Treasury bond
prices. Dow Jones offers the CBOT Treasury Index that comprise a 30-year
bond, a 10-year note, and a 5-year note futures contract that measures the
default-free U.S. dollar capital market returns (DJ Indexes). It’s calculated
every 15 seconds and prices are reported in real time.
The S&P/BG Cantor U.S. Treasury Series includes subindices such as
the U.S. Treasury Bill Index, one- to three-year index, three- to fi ve- year, fi ve-
to seven-year, 7- to 10-year, 10- to 20-year, and 20-plus-year indices (S&P).
The S&P 500 comprises info technology—18.8 percent, fi nancials—15.7
percent, healthcare—11.6 percent, consumer staples—11.3 percent, industrials—
10.8 percent, energy—10.9 percent, consumer discretionary—10.4 per-
cent, utilities—3.6 percent, materials—.5 percent, and telecommunication
services—.2 percent. The Dow 30 comprises industrials—22.07 percent,
technology—17.37 percent, consumer services—13.54 percent, consumer
goods—10.70 percent, oil and gas—0.15 percent, fi nancials—9.92 percent,
healthcare—7.99 percent, telecommunications—4.15 percent, and basic
materials—4.11 percent (S&P).
The S&P 500 index value is a “quotient of total fl oat-adjusted market
cap of constituents and its divisor and is calculated as each stock weight is
proportional to fl oat adjusted market value”. To calculate:

The numerator is calculated as “the price of each stock (cid:4) the number of shares

equal to $11.8 trillion and the divisor is equal to $9.4 billion, the index is equal
to 1250” (S&P). The S&P Index is a modifi cation of a Laspeyres Index.

“If Qo is replaced by Q1, the numerator equals market value and the denomi-
nator is replaced by a divisor represents initial market value and sets the base
value.” Recognize the similarities of the SMI and the German DAX indices.
Dow Jones indices are fl oat adjusted and price weighted. Price weight
means the weight is commensurate with price (DJ Indexes). Charles Dow
calculated his index by adding stock prices and dividing by the number of
stocks (DJ Indexes). Today, add prices of components and divide by the
current divisor. The divisor is published daily in the Wall Street Journal and
is employed to hold the index steady in terms of stock splits, mergers, and
acquisitions (DJ Indexes). The base value 40.94 of the Dow 30 Industrial
Average is derived from 1896 (DJ Indexes). Dow Indices that include the
Dow 65 Composite, Utility and transportation averages are calculated every
two seconds, every 15 seconds during German DAX trading.
The Dow Transportation index comprises 20 of the top transportation
companies and predates the Dow 30 average by almost two years (DJ Indexes).
Transportation Index, New Zealand Dollar/U.S. Dollar
and Australian Dollar/U.S. Dollar
Consider the Dow 30 year to date increased 9.74 percent, the Dow
Transportation Average increased 17.51 percent, Australian dollar/U.S. dollar
price increased year to date from 8800 to 1.0110, and New Zealand dollar/
U.S. dollar increased from 7041 to 7970.
Some Things to Consider
Traditional Dow Theory aligns with the supposition that the Dow Industrial
averages is the measure of manufacturing health while the transportation
index is the measure of transporting manufactured goods. Each index moves
traditionally in conjunction with each other as a measure of an economy
in proper order. Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar can be measured
in terms of the transportation index due to the vital importance transportation
plays in the shipment of Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar goods to
and across the United States. The idea is a healthy economy will see shipment
rates in terms of rail, air, and land decrease and benefi t both currencies. This
is not the only Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar measure but both
pairs strongly correlate to transportation indices. Rare mention is rendered
due to many new instruments with a short-term focus.

The Dow Utility average was fi rst calculated in January 1929 with a
base of 86.64 and 15 present stocks in the index (DJ Indexes). The index
comprises electric and natural gas companies (DJ Indexes). Traditionally,
rising utility prices was a sign of falling interest rates, and rising interest
rates saw averages decline as interest cost to electric companies rose and fell.
Some argue this phenomenon doesn’t hold any longer due to deregulation
(DJ Indexes).
U.S. Dollar/Swiss Franc and Dow Jones Utility Average
Consider 2010 year to date total returns of 6.42 percent, 4.06 percent
total for fi ve years, with a 2010 dividend yield in 2010 of 4.30 percent (DJ
Indexes). Now consider U.S. dollar/Swiss franc began 2010 at 1.0265 and sits
at 0.9598 presently. The inverse correlation is fairly consistent year to year,
which could say that the Utility Index tops during year end as the currency
price drops under a normal wave pattern.
Treasury bond, S&P, and Dow Jones futures trade almost around the
clock on Globex and are quite easy to track.
Interest Rates
Most important in terms of currency pairs is the purpose of trade and move-
ments in interest rates, and interest rates are determined fi rst by the most
interest-rate sensitive instruments. In the United States, Fed funds is what
prices bonds and bonds are what determine direction for stock markets. OCR
determines New Zealand and Australia movements in terms of bonds and
stock markets.
Consider Fed funds contracts begin at $5 million, $5 million for Australia
OCR contracts. The course is to follow the smart money. But during the
course of any trading day, rates can change up or down depending on mar-
ket circumstances, so the focus switches to bonds, yields, and stock markets.
Stock markets are always ancillary indicators, while bonds, yields, and interest
rates are primary indicators because the cost of money is determined, so
therefore can a cost be valued for currency pairs. Currency pairs are money-
market instruments, so prices are refl ected in interbank trading as bonds and
rates are factored. The methodology should be to focus on those short-term
instruments fi rst before the bond, yield, and stock market.

Conclusion
The bond/yield interplay is refl ected and priced into stock markets. Stock
markets as an indicator are then a factor that can be used to gauge spot prices.
Each currency pair has a characteristic in its movement and purpose from
market to market. Each market is quite different depending on the pair.
The euro is one pair where movements are the same throughout all markets.

CHAPTER 9
Currency Cycles,
Currency Futures,
Options, and Volatility
The purpose of this chapter is fi rst to understand currency cycles and how
those cycles were fi rst applied to market instruments. To know inverted pairs
is to know how to apply the right indicator. Gann and Elliot are the premier
indicators and offered with detailed explanations. A pure cycle indicator, how
it is applied, methodology, and formula are explained in depth. E-Quivalents
are discussed at length due to its insight as not only a market tool but its
many functions as an insightful market guide.
A detailed and insightful discussion of options is offered, including how
to factor option premiums, how to know and detect barrier options, and
implied volatility and its calculation.
Volatility and volatility indicators in terms of various formulas, calcula-
tions, strategies, purposes, and uses are discussed with a step-by-step detailed
approach. Popular risk models and their purposes and uses are addressed.
All essential information, calculations, formulas, purposes, methodolo-
gies, and historic frameworks are discussed in depth and detail in order for
those methods to easily be applied in any trade plan.
In order to properly measure such currency pairs as euro/U.S. dollar
and U.S. dollar/euro, it’s imperative to understand these pairs in relation
to currency cycles and cycle measurements, a topic with fi rm adherents or
diametrically opposite views. The concept of cycles particularly as it relates
to currency trading is certainly not new and is quite popular among
researchers and found in many different research reports. All reports vary
however in lengths of cycles in relation to time. If historic currency-pair tops

and bottoms can be the measure since the euro introduction, currency cycles
last anywhere from 12 to 16 weeks, although 16 is on the high side as that
occurred only once since the euro inception in 1999. Notice the correlation
with cycle tops and bottoms and seasonality. The variation of reports may be
because only one side of the inversion is measured. Another may be related to
the historic understanding of cycles.
Cycles in the modern day were measured in terms of business peaks
and troughs to predict recession and expansion and many can be credited
historically. Nokolai Kondratieff identifi ed 54-year cycles, Simon Kuznets
found 18-year cycles, Clement Juglar is noted for the long nine-year cycle,
and Joseph Kitchens identifi ed the four-year cycle. Joseph Schumpeter in
1939 published a defi nitive two-volume set called Business Cycles. It was only
a matter of time before market professionals employed various cycle methods
to predict stock prices.
In simple terms, William Gann’s great contribution to technical analysis
was to divide time and price by geometric angles, while Ralph Elliott’s fi ve-
wave pattern employed Fibonacci numbers to measure each wave. Both
are wave-pattern forms, but both can be measured in relation to time and
price with accuracy.
The basics of Gann say a price over time is equal to a one-by-one angle
drawn at 45 degrees. The idea is that prices rise and fall based on time. Angles
provide support or resistance and highlight where the market is trading at
any given moment. Gann devised nine lines, nine angles, each with various
degrees relative to price and time.
Elliott’s waves comprise fi ve: A, B, C, D, and E. The basics of Elliott in
up trends says A waves rise, B waves correct, C waves rise, D waves are down,
and E waves rise. Then the down waves begin with E waves falling to an
A, B becomes an upward correction, and C continues the downtrend. Smaller
waves may exist within the patterns, called impulse waves, so Fibonacci num-
bers are employed to measure time and price in relation to dominant waves.
The exact timing of the study of pure-cycle analysis in markets is anyone’s
guess. One possible source is JM Hurst’s 1970 classic Profi t Magic of Stock
Transaction Timing. With degrees in mathematics and physics, Hurst built
on the work of nineteenth century mathematician Joseph Fourier and the
Fourier Transform and applied it to stock transactions.
Hurst invented a cyclic system that claimed “8.9 percent yield per trans-
action every 9.7 days” (Profi t Magic). The book is a highly recommended
read, but it is not for the mathematically challenged.
The basic components of Hurst are summarized in Technical Analysis,
the Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians by Charles Kirkpatrick

and Julie Dahlquist. Three basic aspects are measured by cycles: amplitude,
period, and phase.
“Amplitude is measured as the distance of the horizontal axis from peak
to trough, period is the distance between consecutive lows or consecutive
highs and phase is how far from the y-axis cycles begin. The location along
the cycle of each point is measured by this formula: f(x) (cid:3) a (cid:4) cos(bx (cid:5) c) (cid:5) d,
where a (cid:3) amplitude, bx (cid:3) period (constant b times (cid:4) time in radians), c (cid:3) phase
in radians and d (cid:3) error factor.” (Kirkpatrick and Kahlquist) Lastly, “Hurst
measured period lengths in multiples of two or three longer or shorter than
next larger or smaller cycles. A 20-day cycle says another longer cycle of
40- or 60-day length exists. Cosine waves, multiple waves are each calculated
and added to form a summation.” The question of does this method work,
can be answered with just as well as Elliott and Gann, but much more exists
to the methodologies presented here. For example, Hurst factored frequen-
cies, parameters of prices, and measured corrections. Hurst stated in Profi t
Magic that his methodologies took 10 years to perfect. The study of cycles
in this modern day can possibly be credited to Hurst and incorporated by
others.
For example, Doug Schaff invented an indicator for currency traders
called the Schaff Trend Cycle that was based on a variation of Hurst. This is
the fi rst of its type, and is based on Schaff’s years of cycle research. Schaff’s
idea was to fi nd an indicator that traded into the dominant cycle trend. This
was accomplished by blending an Exponential Moving Average and Fast
Stochastics with a cycle component.
For currency pairs, the best measure is by far the ABC pattern, where A
and B are up candles and C corrects down, or A and B are down candles and
C corrects up. Compare this pattern to Elliot’s fi ve waves and one can under-
stand critical arguments to cycles.
Currency pairs cycle from peaks to troughs, as one inverted pair tops,
then the other bottoms, or relatively close. The question is the measure of
inversions.
CME Group Equivalents
An extraordinarily useful tool to traders is Equivalents, offered by the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange (CME). Equivalents operates 23 hours a day from
Sunday to Friday and can be viewed by anyone around the world from any
computer at cmegroup.com/equivalents. Equivalents allows traders to view
currency-pair futures prices live in any contract month, and view live volume

and notional amounts. More useful is the ability to determine spot prices,
cash positions, and a four-time daily update of forward points.
First, view high, lows, and last trades to determine the parameters of
the market. Then determine market bids and offer prices, important because
these prices can represent major support and resistance; more important is
the ability to view market liquidity.
Liquidity is the key to determine if a pair will break a support or resistance
point or if a pair will bounce and maintain a range. Nearest-term contracts are
always represented fi rst. Futures contracts settle quarterly based on International
Money Market standards, M (cid:3) June, U (cid:3) September, Z (cid:3) December, and
H (cid:3) March.
Bids are buy prices and offers are sell prices. What is shown is how many
contracts are bid and offered at various bid and offer prices. This will deter-
mine market direction in terms of longs and shorts. If 200 contracts are bid
at a certain price and 50 contracts are offered at another price, this says the
market is long, so spot prices can go long. Bids and offers can be seen in
longer-dated contracts.
Another tool is to convert futures prices to spot equivalents. Euro is the
most widely traded of all currency pairs and trades at $12.50 per tick, which
converts to $125,000 euros per contract. The formula is number of contracts
multiplied by contract size is equal to currency denomination. For example,
50 contracts multiplied by $125,000 is equal to $6,250,000. This represents
how many euros are offered. For bid prices, 200 contracts multiplied by
$125,000 is equal to $25,000,000 euros bid. The market can now be viewed
in euro liquidity terms.
Japanese yen/U.S. dollar trades yen at 12,500,000, British pounds/U.S.
dollar at 62,500, Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar at Canadian100,000, Swiss
francs/U.S. dollar trade at Swiss francs 125,000, 100,000 for Australian
dollar/U.S. dollar. Ticks are equal to 0.0001, except for the yen quoted at
0.000001 (CME).
The point here is the quote conventions. The question is how many U.S.
dollars will it take to buy one euro? U.S. dollar pairs are quoted directly as
how many dollars to buy X amount of another currency.
In this situation, euro was well bid at a certain price. This says the mar-
ket sees a long euro/U.S. dollar. In inverted cycle terms, the market also sees
a short U.S. dollar/euro. This example serves for the British pounds/U.S.
dollar, Australian dollar/U.S. dollar, and New Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar, all
traded pairs at the CME and offered through Equivalents.
The opposite holds for non-dollar pairs such as Japanese yen/U.S. dollar.
This is the standard arrangement of trade for the yen. It’s called an indirect

quote. It asks how many yen to buy one U.S. dollar? This example could
be any pair arranged in this manner. For Japanese yen/U.S. dollar, deter-
mine direction in terms of contracts, and evaluate in U.S. dollar/Japanese yen
terms which pair to trade. How far each will trade in cycle terms can be found
in cash equivalents.
Forward points are shown at bid and offer prices. Forward points repre-
sent interest-rate differentials between currency pairs, important because they
establish cash equivalents for each currency pair. All pairs will have different for-
ward points due to different interest rate differentials. An interest-rate change
in a nation can change forward points dramatically. The CME updates for-
ward points four times daily to refl ect interest-rate changes in the short term.
Interest-rate changes are refl ected in cash prices. The formula is futures rate
minus forward points is equal to spot cash equivalents.
The methodology now is to evaluate spot-cash prices to futures prices.
Cash prices are almost always above futures prices, it’s the cost of capital now
instead of the future. More important is what is the relationship between spot
and futures prices. Forward prices are established in this manner by forward
price is equal to spot price plus forward points.
Spreads are factored as:
Spot (cid:4) (European foreign currency (cid:2) Eurodollar deposit rate)
(cid:4) (t/360) (cid:4) 100 or S (cid:4) (Eurodollar rate European foreign currency)
(cid:4) (t/365) (cid:4) 100 (CME)
This equation answers the question is futures trading at a discount or pre-
mium to the cash spot price? Both formulas establish either the direct or
indirect quote convention. This methodology allows a view in terms of cen-
tral bank meetings, rate determinations, and direction to pairs when interest
rates are raised or lowered. A caveat, Eurodeposits are established daily for
not only U.S. dollar but the euro, British pounds, and Swiss francs are also
priced and reported shortly after the British Bankers Association (BBA)
LIBOR release.
Forward points are calculated as:
Spot quote/Bid (cid:4) (I quote (cid:2) I base) (cid:4) time/360 (cid:4) 100
Add forward points to the spot quote and it’s a forward quote. A forward quote
is what the market is willing to pay for future spot. This is the measure to factor
inversions. Yet it is not necessarily the method to factor forward-exchange rates.
Forward exchange rates are found in forward interest rate formulas.

274 Inside the Currency Market
Approximately 30 years ago, the International Standardization Organization
(ISO) located in Switzerland determined quoting conventions for currency
pairs. Today it’s called the International Standards Organization. Pairs quoted
as the foreign currency fi rst such as euro/U.S. dollar or British pounds/U.S.
dollar is termed the American-quote convention, a direct quote in market
parlance, while U.S. dollar/Japanese yen or U.S. dollar/Swiss francs are
known as European quotes and quoted as an indirect quote. The establish-
ment, methodologies, and factors of those decisions derived from the ISO
4217:2008 country-codes sectors of the ISO.
The proper name is Codes for the Representation of Currencies and Funds
is and maintained by SIX Interbank Clearing, located in Zurich, Switzerland,
but they fall under responsibility of the British Standards Institution, an ISO
member from the United Kingdom(ISO).
The purpose of 4217 is to enhance trade, commerce, and banking across
borders with identifying features (ISO). Nations are identifi ed by a three-
letter alpha and three- number numeric code. Alpha U.S. dollar is identifi ed
by numeric 840 and includes nations that use U.S. dollars in exchange. The
Alpha euro is identifi ed by numeric 978 and includes all nations that use
the euro in currency exchanges. ISO also establishes decimal points for minor
currencies. The last ISO list was published in 2008, while the prior list was
published in 2001 (ISO).
Currently, 41 pairs trade at the CME and a vast majority are offered
on Equivalents. Pairs such as British pounds/Japanese yen, Australian dollar/
Japanese yen, Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar, and U.S. dollar/Swiss francs can
all be evaluated for direction and inversion terms. A further method is the
March 2009 introduction of the E-micro contracts.
E-Micro
E-Micro currency futures contracts are one-tenth the size of standard con-
tracts so euro is attendant as .001 (cid:3) 1 point and Japanese yen at .01 (cid:3) 1
point. Currently six pairs trade on Globex around the clock on the trading
fl oor, and all can be viewed on Equivalents with the same features as standard
contracts. The six pairs are: euro/U.S. dollar, Australian dollar/U.S. dollar,
British pounds/U.S. dollar, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, U.S. dollar/Canadian
dollar, and U.S. dollar/Swiss francs. The point of note is pair arrangements.
Standard futures contracts trade Japanese yen/U.S. dollar, Canadian
dollar/U.S. dollar, and Swiss francs/U.S. dollar, while E-Micro contracts
trade U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar, and U.S.

dollar/Swiss francs. This is termed spot market, interbank market, or cash
markets to align market parlance properly. Since both contracts trade oppo-
site arrangements, no better instrument is available to measure inversions. As
one pair cycles up, the inverted pair cycles down. But inversions, like cycles,
never match perfectly at times so what is important is directional determina-
tion of each paired inversion.
Options and Volatility
The latest preferred method to trade currency pairs is by option premiums
and volatility. Such a new and sophisticated strategy can only say old meth-
odologies are no longer useful as a strategy nor even as a guide.
For example, Put/Call ratios were once the measure to determine if the
market was long or short. If call buyers exceeded put sellers across all strike
prices, the market is considered long, while put sellers exceeding call buyers is
considered a short market. Traders would then pick and choose strike prices
that aligned to their preferred time frames and determined ratios of longs to
short. While put/call ratios still may work for stock options or other markets,
it appears to be outmoded as a currency-trading plan. The next method was
risk reversals.
Popular market-risk-reversal defi nition says it’s the difference in implied
volatility between a currency option same strike, same expiration of an out-
of-the-money delta 25 put and delta 25 call. The purpose is to measure future
volatility in relation to deltas, but more importantly to gauge market direc-
tion. As future volatility increases, deltas will increase as the value of options
increase due to higher premiums expected by the market. The Chicago Board
Options Exchange (CBOE) defi nition of delta is “the amount an option’s
theoretical value will change for a one unit change in price of the underlying
instrument.” Out-of-the-money options are employed as a strategy to follow
the underlying currency pair. Delta is a 30-day time frame and the shortest of
the Greek options: Gamma, Vega, Theta, and Rho. From an opposing view,
as an option moves toward expiration, deltas decrease and end at zero at expi-
ration. Some then graph and plot strategy based on a skew, yet it accompanies
successes and failures. This is because enormous fallacies are associated with
this strategy.
The fi rst question must be what type of options were measured: over
the counter, exchange-traded options, or both. The second question: were
European and/or American options considered? This is vitally important
because European options are exercised at expiration while American options

can be exercised anytime. This point changes the entire equation, because
both accompany different formulas and methodologies and neither can
be employed together. For example, some track the S&P 500 against VIX
Options that settle European exercise. Secondly, American options trade
fi ve hours longer than European options and that must be held account in
any trading plan (CME Options Rulebook). The methodology is European
options are employed to hedge and American options are widely traded.
The Black Scholes formula originated in 1973 in the Journal of Political
Economy and is employed to measure European options both over the coun-
ter and exchange traded. The vast majority of over-the-counter options are
European exercised.
The Barone, Adesi, and Whaley formula originated in 1987 in the Journal
of Finance to factor American exchange-traded options (CME). The question
for both was how to price and value options, but both formulas must be
employed against its respected type. Consider traded options.
Formulas must factor call and put options, time to expiration, price,
strike price, and interest rates. Interest rates must be factored as a risk-free
rate. The T-Bill is widely employed, but that rate is twice removed from an
actual BBA or internal LIBOR.
John Cox, Stephen Ross, and Mark Rubenstein published a binomial
pricing model in the Journal of Financial Economics in 1979 that valued trades
based on arbitrage that factored a currency pair and currency option. In one
way, Cox-Ross, as it’s known in market parlance, can be viewed as the risk
measure to the two main option pricing models currently in existence.
The Canadians at the Montreal options and derivatives exchange widely
employ Cox-Ross. All three models set standards that haven’t been surpassed
since inception.
In 1983, Mark Garmen and Steven Kohlhagen advanced the Black
Scholes formula with introduction of an interest-rate factor measured against
each side of a currency pair. The purpose was to factor the risk-free rate
between a currency pair that accounts for exchange rates. Finally, is the ques-
tion of implied volatility.
Implied volatility is defi ned by the market as the expected return. The
CME defi nes implied volatility as “implied by a market price of an option
based on option pricing models. Volatility through models yields a theoretical
option value.” Despite a defi nition that said nothing, the key word is implied.
Implied volatility is expected, not guaranteed, but expected if the market
reacts as anticipated. Some say a formula doesn’t exist to calculate implied
volatility hence the purpose to follow a delta strategy. Implied correlation is
the preferred method due to its statistical component.

==================================================

Currency Cycles, Currency Futures, Options, and Volatility 277
Volatility is an estimate based on American or European formulas using
option-market prices as an input. By using past and present prices, implied
volatility is found by running the models backward. These are what-if sce-
narios that incorporate a futures price, strike, option price, days to expiration,
and interest rates. Formulas are factored as F(S, O, D, R).
Market events in a delta strategy can disrupt an expected forecast and
destroy a risk-reversal strategy especially when the return is expected within a
30-day period. The assumption is volatility within a currency pair will increase
the price of deltas. Yet it’s not a guaranteed strategy simply because currency
markets can trade sideways, and move in infi nitesimal ranges with price con-
gestion for long periods. Time will surpass the strategy. Implied volatility may
work well in other markets, but spot prices and its fast rate of change or no
change can impinge the overall measure of volatility unless the strategy was
perfected. Today’s strategy is trade at the money options. A risk measure is
employed by taking the one month interest rate differential and divide by the
implied volatility from the one month at the money call or put option. It’s a
measure of currency options but can be employed to trade equitiy indices.
Volatility and Volatility Indicators
To measure risk is to measure volatility. The question is how far will prices
vary in relation to expected returns? Two instruments can realize different
returns based on variations because we are squaring the difference from the
mean as a measure of variability. So volatility must be measured by squaring
the variance to obtain a standard deviation to obtain an accurate view of
volatility.
Volatility is measured by standard deviation calculated by standard devia-
tion of daily returns over X trading days to annualize the fi gure. This measures
the spread of prices around the mean—the average. When prices are close to
the mean, standard deviation is low, and high when prices are far away.
The general strategy should be buy the low and sell the high.
Standard deviation asks the question how far apart is the distribution.
Normal distribution says prices should be 68 percent within one standard
deviation of the average, 95 percent within 2 standard deviations, and about
96 percent within three standard deviations. This outline is known as realized,
actual, or market volatility that’s generally measured in one- to three-month time
frames, one year to measure historic volatility. Looked at another way, suppose
as suggested by prior research that a 252-day simple moving average was plot-
ted, a mean based on past year price closes that considers U.S. foreign exchange

(FX) trading days and holidays. Much dispersion occurs around the mean over
a yearly period. How to capture those short-term variations in volatility terms
has been the subject of intense research over many years, more so in the present
day as option trading increased with new fi nancial instruments. Consider that in
Whaley’s historic 1987 paper, 30 American options traded on the CME.
The main point associated with volatility and volatility indicators is it
tends toward mean reversion where prices oscillate around a long-term aver-
age. Whether low or high volatility, it mean reverts. A rate of return of vola-
tility as an annualized standard deviation percentage index or indicator can
be converted to shorter time frames. For example, a 20 percent index value
converts to a monthly value by multiplying 20 percent by square root of one-
twelfth, for a 5.77 forecast that predicts movement of one standard deviation
over one month of (cid:5)/(cid:2) 5.77 (ASX example). This formula addresses the
question of stressed rates.
Stress rates ask the question what is the probability z scores change based
on whatever standard deviations are measured in relation to the square root
of time? The formula is:
Szσ√t
e
where
s = spot in logs,
e = the natural logarithm,
z = a z score, sigma (SD) at the square root of t.
It’s a strategy not only to determine spot prices but other market instruments
such as options. Market professionals view this methodology as a measure-
ment of a time series employed for the short term. The purpose is to capture
only volatility that deviated from normal trend.
Another strategy widely employed by central banks is to measure volatility
between two pair’s exchange rates and correlate.
The formula
σ— 2 (cid:3) σ— 2 (cid:5) σ— 2 (cid:2) 2 σ σ
12 1 2 p 1 2
where
volatility 12 (cid:3) cross rate volatility,
volatility 1 (cid:3) volatility of exchange rate 1,
volatility 2 (cid:3) volatility of exchange rate 2, and
p (cid:3) correlation between currency 1 and 2.
Prior research measured volatility in terms of options, and measured
volatility by Garch models, Arch models, time-series models, long-term

volatility, and short-term volatility. Papers measured single-market instru-
ments, c ombined markets, and instruments. The study of pure v olatility
began in the summer of 2000 in the Journal of Alternative Investments by
Robert Krause and intensifi ed over the years.
Krause proposed then a pure volatility contract, later fi nalized and out-
lined in the 2010 issue of the Swiss Derivatives Review. Many questions were
settled with formulation of the CME’s 2011 introduction of Krause’s volatility
contracts on six currency pairs, euro/U.S. dollar, British pounds/U.S. dollar,
Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar, Australian dollar/U.S. dollar, Swiss francs/U.S.
dollar and Japanese yen/U.S. dollar. Vol (Trademark) contracts are cash set-
tled and settle to either the 1 or 3 month realized volatility.
The formula is:
⎛ p ⎞2 ∑n
RV =100 × 252/n ⎜L t ⎟ R2
⎝ n p t−1⎠ t
t=1
where
n (cid:3) number of trading days,
r (cid:3) continuous compounded daily returns calculated by
t
p
r (cid:3) L t and,
t n p t−1
where
L (cid:3) natural logarithm,
n
p (cid:3) underlying reference price at time t, and
t
p (cid:3) underlying reference price at time t period preceding time t.
t(cid:2)1
The formula is calculated as an annualized standard deviation of log returns
of daily settlement. Any volatility contract should begin with zero as the
foundation point. To defi ne a mean, it begins at a zero point and deviations
occur from that point.
At the Volatility Institute at New York University, many time-series charts
for various fi nancial instruments are available for daily review at the vlab, as
well as many published papers and lists of courses. Robert Krauss updated
volx.us with an abundance of information, papers, and trade strategies.
Option Premiums
On any screen shot of American currency options is a view of volume, futures
price, option price, and strike price for each option offered. American cur-
rency options trade at premiums in half-point strike price increments and

represent 85 percent of total CME volume (CME Options Rulebook).
Premiums are quoted in U.S. dollar points per foreign currency. The notional
values equal the same underlying price convention, $12.50 euro, $62,500
British pounds.
The formula to determine premium is:
Points (cid:4) Contracts (cid:4) Tick value
For example, a 1.4430 euro/U.S. dollar call option bid at 75 (cid:4) 150 con-
tracts is equal to 0.0075 multiplied by $125,000 equals $937.50. To sell the
option 150 multiplied by $937.50 equals $140,625. A premium quote is
reported as the equivalent of a live price in the OTC market (2010 Option
Rulebook). To know currency options is to know liquidity in the market
related to any currency pair combined with the futures and cash prices.
The overall question is where is the market in terms of liquidity and at what
strike price, a determination of a long or short market.
Barrier Options
The importance of this section is not to understand barrier options, how to
trade those options, and price methodologies. Rather it’s important to know
where barriers are located within spot currency prices to determine if a break
or bounce will occur at a particular price once a barrier is reached.
Importers, exporters, and major companies routinely employ barrier
options to facilitate trade across borders. For example, Canadians employ
barrier options to facilitate oil fl ows and other trade to U.S. markets, its
largest export partner. Japanese exporters routinely employ barrier options
to facilitate a multitude of trade in various products to various world
destinations.
A multitude of barrier options can routinely be found within yen prices
in various currency-pair arrangements. Since the United States is the second-
largest export market, Japanese yen/U.S. dollar and U.S. dollar/Japanese yen
must be evaluated to determine where barriers are located since barriers may
restrict a price break at certain levels.
Barrier levels at certain prices are either defended successfully, in which a
bounce will occur in the opposite direction, or an unsuccessful defense occurs
and prices will continue a forward path. Barrier options are employed to lock
in a particular price.

Currency Cycles, Currency Futures, Options, and Volatility 281
Other currency pairs may contain barrier options to hedge other fi nan-
cial instruments. Other types of barrier options exist such as a Binary or Plain
Vanilla, but they don’t have the market power as a full barrier option simply
because of a higher-priced barrier. The question for deployment of barrier
options is how important is the price and cost to defend it. European-style
options are by far the most popular deployed, yet American- and Bermuda-
style are also employed (US FX Committee 2005 Report). Bermuda options
allow expiration relative to time, but specifi c dates relative to exercise must
be stated in prior arranged agreements. For traders, it’s the nondiscrete
barrier options to monitor because they are determined by the spot rate
(FX Committee 2005).
Barrier options began trade with formal outlines implemented by the
U.S. FX Committee and other organizations such as the International Swaps
and Derivatives Association in 1998 with an additional update in 2005 and
2006. Highlights from the updated report follow.
A barrier event was further defi ned. The committee question was how
does one know a barrier was reached? A barrier-determination agent was intro-
duced as a third-party confi rmation a barrier event occurred. Determination
dates and rate calculations were further defi ned. Barrier and other options are
backed by extensive agreements that outline the terms between two parties.
The real purpose to this supplementary report was to further defi ne barrier
options and single- and double-No-Touch and One-Touch binary options.
It was a forward report, as most of these reports are facilitated by market
professionals.
Two types of barrier options exist for our purposes, Knock in/Knock out
and Double Knock in/Double Knock out. Knock-out options terminate if
spot trades at or beyond a defi ned barrier before expiration. The closer the
knock out to the spot rate, the less expensive it is because the probability that
the barrier is reached will increase.
A knock-in option is inactive but becomes live if spot trades at or beyond
a barrier before expiration. The closer Knock in trades to spot, the more the
option will increase because the probability exists that the barrier will be hit
(FX Committee). Double Knock-in and Double-Knock out options include
another barrier. News organizations that specialize in currency markets rou-
tinely report locations of barrier options.
The problem with movements at times of an export currency such as the
U.S. dollar/Japanese yen is barrier options are routinely located within vari-
ous price points of U.S. dollar/Japanese yen that at times restrict movements.
It’s not unusual to see a $5 or $10 million barrier located at a certain price.

Volatility and Value-at-Risk Models
Volatility affects market prices as a function primarily from outside forces.
Infl ation, interest rates, political changes, economic disasters, military esca-
pades, and wars all affect markets in terms of volatility levels and levels can
change dramatically.
Dollars at Risk seeks to determine such factors as yield-curve movements
in relation to currency prices and employed as a measure of risk. Dollars at
Risk ask questions as to how many basis points does a 10-year Treasury bond
move in relation to a target price or stop loss order, and what about two-year-
bond basis points? The preferred method is to factor fi xed-income returns
against a constructed yield curve using various risk measures that account for
volatility.
Value-at-risk (VAR) models assess risk using “statistical techniques on
worst-case scenarios that can’t exceed a particular confi dence level. It measures
risk in relation to leverage. New components include volatility, correlations,
and exponentially weighted moving averages to assess risk” ( Jorion 2007).
Conclusion
After a historic walk through past economists such as Schumpeter and
methodologies of economic business cycles, an introduction of currency
cycles was offered in terms of inversions. The methodology of currency cycles
is in the measurement. Since currency-pairs invert, past inventors of indi-
cators widely employed today such as Gann and Elliot were offered as a
methodology to help in understanding how and why cycles occur, with
a further idea that methodologies can be applied easily to a chart.
Volatility was discussed in all its minute details of historic importance
as well as offered formulas to calculate and measure market instruments and
currency pairs, volatility in relation to options and premiums, and barrier
options. Risk models in terms of VAR and dollars at Risk were addressed.

CHAPTER 10
Technical Analysis
This chapter highlights in depth and detail many market tools and various
indicators. Volume and open interest is discussed due to its wide use
and effectiveness. Formulas, trade strategies, trading methodologies, and
past history to understand its modern-day context are all highlighted.
Commitment of traders’ reports, where to fi nd them at the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange
(CME), how to read the reports, and which ones to read, as well as their
points of reference in order to evaluate a trade plan is explained step by
step. The Baltic Exchange, its derivation, products, purpose, functions,
and evaluative tools are addressed in order to track commodity currencies.
Correlations, then regression lines and other trend lines, are shown and
methodologies highlighted to understand how to plot lines on a chart to
measure currency and other market prices. Special Drawing Rights (SDRs)
and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) may be a future indicator due
to wide use of the SDR fi nancial instrument. Pivot points, Bollinger Bands,
and Ichimoku, and their purpose, derivations, calculations, and formulas
along with full explanations of how to measure currency and other market
prices is fully explained.
Currency-pair prices trend, range, or cluster in a zone for periods of time,
while other periods of time account for volatility. How to measure various
phenomena can be gauged by market tools and/or indicators.
It’s imperative to know a range of indicators to account for various mar-
ket periods, yet it’s also imperative to be able to shift indicators as market
periods meld from one type to another, such as range to trend. Indicators
are never perfect, but they provide reasonable estimates of various market
periods. Reasonable estimates are derived from indicator calculations.

==================================================

284 Inside the Currency Market
For example, Bollinger Bands are widely deployed to account for both
volatility and moving-average components. Moving averages measure mean
time series over time, pivot points measure support and resistance, and
Ichimoku measures moving averages for present and future market condi-
tions. All work equally well to capture profi ts, but none have the perfection
of a pure mathematical model. Yet markets are never perfect so it’s imperative
to allow confi rmation in every market scenario.
The import of any indicator is to know its minute details as well as any
currency pair for its various characteristics, because all have variations. Some
indicators work well in trends, others work better in short-term market moves.
Volume and Open Interest
Volume and open interest studies trace their roots to commodity trading with
passage of the Commodity Exchange Act on September 21, 1922. It was
formerly titled the Grain Futures Act, but was amended in June 1936 to
include other traded commodities such as wheat, rice, corn, oats, and other
agricultural products (Bear, 1948).
The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), established in 1848, was mandated by
the Agricultural Department to maintain volume and other extensive records for
open inspection for at least three years. Commitment of Traders (COT) Reports
today still maintain a three-year history for public view. The main purpose for
the records was to maintain integrity of the markets due to the importance of
agricultural products to the American public in staple and export terms.
Open interest is assumed to be a byproduct of future market develop-
ments. Yet the Chicago Daily Tribune reported open interest for wheat con-
tracts as early as 1926.
The New York Stock Exchange traces its roots to the 1792 Buttonwood
Agreement where 24 brokers signed an agreement to trade securities by com-
mission (NYSE). Possibly volume and open-interest studies trace their roots
to these early days and became a natural byproduct with establishment of
organized commodity exchanges.
As two of the oldest indicators, volume and open interest hasn’t been a
focus in the modern day due to more popular, ready-made indicators. Yet
volume and open interest have been a constant staple for market professionals
since inception.
Ken Shaleen of Chartwatch can be credited with writing the defi nitive
book in 1992, called Volume and Open Interest. Outside Ken Shaleen’s work,



==================================================
                     PAGE 298                     
==================================================

Technical Analysis 285
volume and open interest has been contained within the confi nes of market
professionals because not much has been written since Shaleen. Ironically,
market professionals know nothing about popular indicators, nor do non-market
professionals know anything about professional tools. Market professionals
employ pure mathematical models while nonprofessionals employ indicators,
and neither interest intersects.
Open interest is defi ned by the CME as total futures contracts long
or short in a delivery month entered into but not offset by delivery. Only
one side of the transaction is calculated. Volume is simply the number of
contracts bought or sold for a given time period. Volume in days past was
an essential ingredient as a hedge, called price insurance (Baer 1948). Open
interest was the trading method. Today, volume and open interest together
are employed to determine trends, market sentiment, and direction by mon-
itoring contract fl ows.
Under daily settlements on the CME web site is where volume and
open interest information is found. Anyone can view foreign exchange (FX)
futures, FX options, or both for open interest and volume reports. The new
addition is FX Micro contracts and the key is to study open interest and
volume because Micro contracts are arranged as spot transactions, so a full
view of standard and FX Micros can be determined.
Three different reports may be employed: futures only, options and put/
call totals, and Micro contracts. For options, volume and open interest is
now available for each strike price. Long-term traders would be interested in
near- and next-term contracts while short-term traders would be served by
nearest contracts. Floor trading and Globex are the two reports of interest.
An initial report is issued after market closes that includes fl oor trading, and
fi nal reports are issued before market openings the next day that include fl oor
trading and Globex trading from overnight. There are a number of scenarios
to monitor.
A trending market occurs when volume and open interest is up. Prices
rise on increased volume and open interest. Low volume may be a correction,
but it depends if open interest rises (Shaleen). A rise is a correction, a fall
could be a reversal. Average volume is a range trade. When volume and open
interest is up and prices decline, chances are good it’s a downtrend (Shaleen).
Average volume and fl at open interest represent congestion, an unsure market,
or a wait-and-see approach to outside events (Shaleen).
The key is to compare Japanese yen/U.S. dollar futures and options
against U.S. dollar/Japanese yen Micros to determine direction. Same
for Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar and Swiss franc/U.S. dollar futures and



==================================================

==================================================

286 Inside the Currency Market
options against Micro U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar/Swiss
franc. Traders should look at option-strike prices with the understanding that
American options are the vast majority of trade.
COT Reports
The weekly COT report is still a valuable tool studied by market profes-
sionals to determine market direction, sentiment, and trend. Two types of
reports are released weekly for fi nancial futures and options. Legacy reports
for currency pairs highlight commercial and noncommercial positions,
longs and shorts for each currency pair, open interest, open interest as a per-
centage by trader type, and weekly changes. Commercials could be hedgers
or wish to manage risk, while non-commercials are everybody else. Futures
only and futures and options combined reports are available weekly free of
charge from the CFTC.
The recommendation is to view each report separately to determine
open interest for futures and options because futures and micro contracts are
reported together. U.S. dollar/Japanese yen must be viewed critically due to
the Japanese yen/U.S. dollar futures arrangement. This is why options must
be viewed separately to determine sentiment. COT reports are without ques-
tion a vital tool and worth every trader’s time and effort. The report to view
should always be reportable positions.
August 2010 marked the fi rst publication of Traders in Financial Futures
(TFF). The reports contain the same information but classifi cation of traders
are identifi ed and their market activity.
The fi rst of four categories of large traders are Dealers/Intermediaries
who represent the sell side of the market. Asset Managers/Institutional are
pension funds, portfolio managers, and mutual funds to name a few. This
category represents the buy side of the market. Third are Leverage Funds,
who are money managers and hedge funds who represent the buy side of the
market. Finally Other Reportables represent hedgers.
A category of spreading was introduced to both the legacy and TFF
reports. The CFTC “computes spreading amount equal to offsetting longs
and shorts held by a trader. It’s calculated as the amount of offsetting in differ-
ent calendar months or offsetting futures and options in the same or different
calendar months” (CFTC).
Since COT reports all futures and options for all traded instruments, con-
fi rmation of proposed or ongoing currency pair trades can be validated by its
respective instrument. For example, euro/U.S. dollar can be validated by oil.

Technical Analysis 287
Both are risk assets that move together. Agricultural commodities are risk assets
and confi rmed by Australian dollar/U.S. dollar and New Zealand dollar/U.S.
dollar since both move together.
Australian dollar/U.S. dollar prices are moved more by coal and metal
prices for exports more so than any other commodities. New Zealand
dollar/U.S. dollar prices respond to logs, dairy, wool, and meat. U.S. dollar/
Canadian dollar is a commodity currency that must be measured criti-
cally against oil and specifi c commodities inherent to Canada’s trade fl ows.
Corporations, importers, exporters, and central bankers with oil interests can
swing Canadian dollar prices as they seek to lock a respective oil price. Metals
are risk assets and can be measured against all risk currencies. For example,
industrial gold exported from Australia is another measure for Australian
dollar/U.S. dollar risk.
Bollinger Bands
John Bollinger recently celebrated the twenty-fi fth anniversary of his
Bollinger Band introduction. Its wide use in all markets attests to its suc-
cess, and forex is no different because it has survived the test of time. The
purpose of Bollinger Bands is to capture highs and lows on a relative basis
using standard deviation to measure volatility and a moving average to mea-
sure time series.
To understand Bollinger Bands methodology is to know Bollinger’s rules
for use.
Bollinger Bands confi rm W and M market patterns. They can be used for
buy and sell decisions. Closing prices outside the bands don’t necessarily mean
market reversal; they may mean price continuation. Yet prices that touch the
upper or lower band doesn’t always translate to a buy or sell. Bandwidths can
be adjusted. As moving averages increase or decrease so must standard devia-
tions increase or decrease. Bollinger recommends two standard deviations for
a 20-period moving average, 2.1 standard deviations for a 50-period moving
average, and 1.9 standard deviations for a 10-period moving average. Moving
average refers to simple moving averages and factored in the formula. Yet true
sample size standard deviations are small so distributions are not normal.
Indicators are normalized with percent b.
Parker Evans in the 2008 Journal of Technical Analysis performed a study
employing percent b as adopted in the Bollinger Band calculation. He defi nes
percent b as an oscillator that measures closing prices in relation to the upper
and lower bands.

==================================================

288 Inside the Currency Market
Many traders employ two sets of Bollinger Bands with various moving
averages and standard deviations. Bollinger recommends confi rmation by a
sentiment or momentum indicator.
Simple Moving Averages
Precisely when a simple moving average was applied to a chart remains a mys-
tery. It probably occurred after the fi rst reported open interest in the 1920s
but before the 1960s introduction of exponential moving averages. What is
known as a simple moving average is an old indicator that survived the test of
time for its effectiveness.
To calculate: add closing prices over X days and divide by X. A 20-day
simple moving average is calculated by adding 20 closing prices and dividing
the sum by 20. On the next day, the fi rst day drops from the calculation and
a new day is added to smooth the average.
Traders should focus on 10-, 20-, 50-, and 100-day averages and employ
those as support and resistance levels as well as crossovers. Long crossovers
occur when a 10-day crosses above a 20-day average and short crossovers occur
when the 10-day crosses below a 20-day average. The same phenomena
occur for 50- and 100-day averages. Many employ the 200-day average as
well, but its accuracy deserves mention.
The most important simple moving average for a yearly view of the mar-
ket has been the 200-day average. Factor trading days in the United States
minus weekends and holidays, the 200-day average is actually 253 days, 249
for Canada, 249 for Australia, 253 for New Zealand, 245 for Japan, 258 for
the euro, and 255 for the Swiss.
The 200-day average not only doesn’t exist, but any yearly calculation
based on it for trading purposes will be off by at least 45 days, possibly more,
depending on the currency pair calculated.
The recommendation is to deploy the proper sized average to the cur-
rency pair in the respective market. For example, a long euro/U.S. dollar
in Europe should employ the 258-day average, while a long U.S. dollar/
Swiss franc in the United States should employ the 253-day average. Further,
employ the proper period for 100-day crossovers from above or below.
To employ a standard deviation moving-average indicator, subtract the
moving average from each of the data points used in the moving-average
calculation. This is a list of deviations from the average. Square each devia-
tion and add them all together. Divide the sum by the number of periods
selected and take the square root. This is a volatility indicator where high

standard deviations will see prices fall and low standard deviations will see
prices rise. The indicator will move opposite of prices.
Ichimoku Kinko Hyo
Ichimoku is an old Japanese indicator purportedly invented by a Japanese
trader in the 1940s. Purportedly because the English and Japanese translation
of the book can’t be found, so it’s assumed that Ichimoku methods exist today
based on past Japanese tradition.
The widespread use of Ichimoku as a primary indicator in Japan and
throughout Asia was highlighted by Nicole Elliott in her 2007 book Ichimoku
Charts. It’s imperative to understand the methodology of Ichimoku to mea-
sure not only Japanese yen pairs, but Ichimoku can be employed on any
fi nancial instrument. The success and further methodologies of Ichimoku
can be found in a study in the Summer 2008 Journal of Technical Analysis.
Ichimoku Highlights
Ichimoku incorporates fi ve moving average lines that work based on mar-
ket highs and lows rather than closing prices. The Tenkan line is the short-
est moving average and provides trade signals. The calculation is as follows:
Subtract the lowest low over the past 9 days from the highest high in the same
time period, then divide the sum by two. The Kijun line is a medium-term
moving average calculated as follows: Add the highest high of the past 26
candles or days from the lowest low of the same time frame and divide that
sum by two (Elliott).
Senkou Span A and Senkou Span B begin formation of the cloud, Kumo
in Japanese, that provides an upper boundary of support and lower boundary
of resistance. Senkou Span A calculation is:
Tenkan (cid:5) Kijun/2 plotted 26 days ahead
Senkou Span B calculation:
Highest high in last 52 days (cid:5) lowest low of the past 52 days/
2 offset 26 days ahead
Chikou Span is the momentum line calculated as today’s closing price plotted
26 days back.

==================================================

290 Inside the Currency Market
The basics of Ichimoku say buy when Tenkan crosses above Kijun and
sell when Tenkan crosses below. Prices above the cloud signify a bullish sit-
uation while prices below the cloud is a bear situation. Tenkan and Kijun
crossovers above and below the cloud must be managed due to its short-term
duration and relation to cloud support and resistance. Ichimoku is a trend
indicator that employs Fibonacci time series as a measure of price targets and
wave pattern measurement. (Elliott).
As a personal favorite indicator, my sincere recommendation for the
9-, 26-, and 52-day periods is not to shorten the lengths of the periods,
especially if a trade is managed throughout all markets. These are special time-
tested numbers to measure time, price, and waves, that the overall features
of Ichimoku use (Elliott). The inventor worked tirelessly for many years to
perfect Ichimoku. Additionally, these numbers can measure currency-price
congestion using the special day-count numbers. Used correctly, Ichimoku
can stand alone as a primary indicator as the Japanese intended.
Baltic Dry Index
An important barometer to monitor commodity currencies and export-
dependent nations such as Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar, and Japanese
yen is the Baltic Exchange located in London. The Baltic Exchange advertises
itself as the only independent source of maritime-market information. And
rightly so since its existence traces back more than 250 years.
With a 550-member organization, the purpose of the group is arrange
ocean transportation of bulk cargoes such as oil, coal, grain, iron ore, and
sugar, to name a few categories, on behalf of ship owners and charterers
(Baltic Exchange). The Baltic Exchange provides daily market information
for the dry market for Capesize, Panamax, Supramax, and Handysize vessels
(Baltic Exchange). Wet market products such as oil are also reported.
The main question for traders to monitor commodity currencies is who
is shipping and where are shipments delivered or placed in storage. Most
important is what is the price of shipping costs and is it rising or falling.
A downturn in the number of orders for freight deliveries and freight
rates may mean a downturn in commodity prices, a downturn in expected
profi ts for commodity currencies, and a downturn in spot prices. Likewise, a
healthy commodity market is a rise in orders. Current 2010 dry-side orders
in the fi rst four months amounted to 18.8 million dry weight, while all 2009
saw 33.6 million dry orders. Compare that to Australian dollar/U.S. dollar
and New Zealand dollar/U.S. dollar and notice a rise in spot prices. Dry

Technical Analysis 291
Supramax routes are reported during Asian sessions as of September 2010
while market information is reported Monday through Friday at 13:00
London time. Dry side orders are no longer reported due to the introduction
and fi rst trade on Baltex.
Baltex is an electronic marketplace introduced by the Baltic exchange to
trade dry freight derivatives. The fi rst trade began June 2011 and the exchange
is regulated by the FSA in the UK.
The four Baltic indices include the Capesize, Panamax, Supramax,
and Handysize with a separate category for Baltic International Tanker
Routes. Currently 19 routes are mapped for oil deliveries, though a change
is expected as the U.S. Gulf Coast oil route was closed for seven years. Oil
routes will be rerouted from the United States to Brazil to China as new
oil fl ows into China. U.S. oil rigs closed in the Gulf reopened in Brazil,
and Brazilian oil fl ow is expected to fl ow to China (Baltic Exchange Site).
The Baltic Dry Index (BDI) is the most prominent, as traders trade for-
ward rate agreements against its price. The BDI is calculated by taking
time-charted components of all indices. Currently 20 routes are covered
within the BDI. Generally as the BDI rises, commodity currencies and
major export nations’ spot prices rise. The confi rmation for any market is
monitoring the respective nation’s transportation indices and the indices of
major export destinations.
IMF and Special Drawing Rights
Special Drawing Rights (SDR) traditionally never deserved special attention
since their inception in 1969 but a number of recent developments may have
implications for the future in terms of nation-to-nation trade, prices of com-
modities bought and sold in world markets, and central bank reserves.
From 1944 to 1973, the world operated on a fi xed gold system—currencies
were pegged to the price of an ounce of gold. Member nations of the IMF
contributed a portion of their reserves to support the SDR system of trade on
a voluntary quota system. Least-developed nations lacked gold and reserves
so couldn’t afford contributions in gold terms as a means to exchange their
currencies. Plus gold was priced in U.S. dollars. So least-developed nations
lacked the means to participate in global trade.
The main mandate of the IMF is ensure exchange rate stability. Their
mandate worked for developed nations only so they devised the SDR as a
“reserve asset to supplement reserves of all members” (IMF). The IMF defi ni-
tion of SDR is a “claim on freely usable currencies of members.” The IMF

292 Inside the Currency Market
has185 members, most who joined after 1981. Government-to-government
relations are transacted by the SDR system.
From 1969 to 1973, SDR’s value was pegged to gold at 0.888671 grams
of gold as the U.S. dollar equivalent (IMF). After 1973, fl oating exchange
rates were the new world order so SDRs were pegged to a basket of four
currencies with various weights: U.S. dollar—44 percent, euro—34 percent,
yen—11 percent, and British pound—11 percent (IMF).
The IMF sums the value of the four currencies in U.S. dollars measured to
six decimal places directly after the London British Bankers Association (BBA)
LIBOR release and reported on the IMF web site, with updates every 20 min-
utes. SDRs are then priced and exchanged by members on a voluntary basis or
the stronger nations purchase from the weaker nations (IMF). Basket weights
are reviewed every fi ve years to determine changes. The factors considered are
amounts of trade in goods and services. The November 2010 release of the
new basket weights works as follows: US dollar 41.9, euro 37.4, British pound
11.3 and Japanese yen 9.4. For the fi rst time since weights were fi rst reported,
the US dollar lost value.
Interest is credited or deducted every Friday based on SDR allocations.
The euro is credited or debited based on Eurepo rates, United Kingdom
based on Treasury Bills, Japanese based on Treasury Discount Bills, and the
United States based on Treasury bills (IMF).
Two previous allocations were distributed to nations. The fi rst was SDR
$9 billion, distributed between 1970 and 1972. The second $12 Billion
SDR was distributed between 1979 and 1981 (IMF).
The G-20 nations voted and approved a special allocation in 2009 of
U.S. $250 billion, 74.3 percent of eligible participants’ quota. This means
each participating member receives their SDR quota equal to 74 percent of
present totals (IMF Press Release). Emerging markets received U.S. $100 billion,
with U.S. $18 billion to low-income nations. A special SDR $21.5 billion was
allocated. The SDR $21.5 billion allocation brings the total SDR fund to
U.S. $283 billion. The goal is to increase cumulative totals to US $1.1 trillion
(IMF Press Release).
One fi fth of new member nations that joined the IMF after 1981 never
participated in the SDR program, yet the special allocation was available to
them. Critics argued many allocated SDRs were sold and transferred back
to the home currency and used to increase a nation’s offi cial reserves. China
and Russia were benefi ciaries, China by an increase and Russia by joining
the SDR program for the fi rst time, along with many African and South
American nations.

==================================================

Technical Analysis 293
SDRs can’t be traded and only have ramifi cations for nation-to-nation
business conducted through the IMF. The implications for future policy are
what is important.
If nation reserves are increased due to SDR allocations, then SDR must
be monitored as an indicator and insight into reserves. Spot prices will refl ect
any increases because economies and economic releases will improve.
Australia is a true commodity currency as defi ned by the IMF because
more than 50 percent of exports are defi ned as commodities. Currently the
Royal Bank of Australia (RBA) monitors the Australian commodity index,
called the Index of Commodity Prices (ICP), by SDR rates. This is the fi rst of
its type and could have huge implications for future policy. A few questions
to ponder include what if commodities were bought and sold strictly between
governments? What if SDRs became the new reserve currency used as a sole
method of trade? What are implications for private companies and importers
and exporters who can’t participate in the SDR system? As new SDR alloca-
tions are funded, old questions materialize in the research. Votes in the com-
mittee to determine any SDR policy is based on SDR holdings and the US
currently by far represents the largest vote.
Australia’s ICP is actually calculated in Australian dollar, U.S. dollar, and
SDR terms, possibly because most Australian commodities are exported in
non-Australia dollars and commodity exports comprise about 25 percent of
Australia’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (RBA). Possibly the reason to cal-
culate the ICP in Australian dollar, U.S. dollar, and SDR terms is to deter-
mine which currency should be employed to export and measured against
the profi ts of the imported nation’s currency. All nations measure Home
currency/SDR for evaluation terms. For the future, this development may
deserve special attention as an economic indicator.
Pivot Points
The purpose for introduction of this old and reliable indicator is due to its
widespread use by fl oor traders and other market professionals. The tradition
continues to this day. Yet pivot points are important to measure other instru-
ments such as stock indices against currency pairs.
The basic pivot-point calculation is provided, yet much experiment
can be formulated for other uses. For example, Daniel Fernandez in the
December 2010 Currency Trader magazine highlighted pivot points calcu-

294 Inside the Currency Market
Traditional pivot-point applications determined support and resistance
levels, but as time progressed, trading methodologies were employed such as
range and price breaks with addition of new sets of pivot points. It became a
trading plan used as a single indicator.
The calculation is:
PP (cid:3) (High (cid:5) Low (cid:5) Close)/3 1st Support (cid:3) (2 (cid:4) PP) – High
• 1st Resistance (cid:3) (2 (cid:4) PP) (cid:2) Low
• 2nd Support (cid:3) PP (cid:2) (High (cid:2) Low)
• 2nd Resistance (cid:3) PP (cid:5) ( 2 (cid:4) High) (cid:2) Low
• 3rd Support (cid:3) 2PP (cid:2) (High – Low)
• 3rd Resistance (cid:3) 2PP (cid:5) High (cid:2) (2 (cid:4) Low)
Currency Correlations and Trend Lines
An explanation of correlation coeffi cients is included to understand why and
how currency pairs correlate or don’t correlate.
Somewhere around the late 1800s or early 1900s, Karl Pearson was cred-
ited with Pearson’s Product Moment Correlation Coeffi cient, the famous R.
The formula is:
∑ (∑ )(∑ )
N xy− X y
r=
n(∑ X2) −(∑ X)
2
n(∑ y2) −(∑ y)
2
This equation asks the question how strong and what direction is a linear
relationship between X and Y ? The purpose is only to determine if a positive
or negative relationship exists. It’s a measure on a number line with 0 as the
middle bound between positive and negative values. A perfectly positive value
means r (cid:3) (cid:5)1 and perfectly negative values means r (cid:3) (cid:2)1. This says both
are perfect fi ts. As X increases or decreases, y increases or decreases in perfect
unison. But currency pairs are never perfect fi ts.
To determine the fi t, measure the proportion of the variance from one
variable to the other, x and y by squaring the sums. This explains the percent
variation determined by the variance and predicts future outcomes. Suppose
the euro/U.S. dollar and British pound/U.S. dollar has a 0.70 positive rela-
tionship. Multiply by 100 and 70 percent is the correlation between the two
pairs. The other 30 percent is unexplained and called randomness if no other
considerations are factored in this regression model.

==================================================

Technical Analysis 295
Many factor other pairs and plot the x and y results on a chart. A trend
line called a regression line can be drawn using the equation
y (cid:3) mx (cid:5) b
where
m (cid:3) slope, and
b (cid:3) y intercept.
The slope is the change in y divided by change in x. The more positive the
slope, the more the line will trend up. Likewise, the more negative the slope,
the more the line will trend down. Much can be done with trend lines.
Edson Gould invented what was known as Speed Resistance Lines, today
known as one-third—two-thirds lines and used to measure market correc-
tions. Gould employed the lines to measure price points. For example, rising
speed lines are measured by “taking the vertical distance between recent
highs and lows and divide into thirds. Straight lines are drawn from the low
through the one-third—two-thirds vertical distance. For a falling line, divide
the vertical distance from high to low into thirds and draw straight lines from the
high through the one-third—two-thirds point on the vertical distance” (Shade).
Many still employ Edson Gould’s long-ago invention by measuring other mar-
kets and currency pairs for one-third and two-thirds corrections.
The trend line drawn to measure highs to lows is not only popular today
but used by a vast, vast majority to measure price points. Price points should
always be measured in percents. It’s an observation that various trend lines
were the beginning of channel lines that boxes candlesticks and/or prices in a
channel. All are viable technical tools and all work equally well.
The euro/U.S. dollar and British pound/U.S. dollar may be positively
related, but that doesn’t mean it will move in unison 100 percent of the time
because it’s not correlated to 100 percent, only 70 percent. Many times one
pair will move without the other. That is a market gift and can be measured
by the above formulas. If the euro trends without the British pound, it’s only
time before the British pound will trend. Why it didn’t move is explained by
randomness, the 30 percent unexplainable. Yet opposite correlations don’t
mean prices move pip for pip, because the correlations aren’t perfectly fi t to
100 percent.
The positive aspect about correlations is other markets can be measured
in relation to currency pairs. Yet currency pairs can be measured against a
bond’s cash fl ows. These indicators are time tested by past generations of
market professionals and all work as intended.

296 Inside the Currency Market
Whatever strategy is employed, the recommendation is use it, practice it,
perfect it, and stay with the same methodology day after day. It’s the market
that may deviate, not the strategy. That can be expected from time to time,
this is why they are called markets. Live with the idea of reasonable expecta-
tions where probabilities and risk are factored into every trade. The rewards
of the markets will be seen.
Currency pairs can be volatile; they trend, range, cluster, and even stay con-
gested for long periods of time. For the most part, currency pairs tend to range
more than they trend and experience volatility. An essential ingredient to any
trader’s arsenal is to employ, to know, and to understand an indicator. One indi-
cator may work to capture consistent profi ts but a risk factor—an error term must
be employed. That is found in an opposite indicator rather than its complement.
One risk measure is the second set of Bollinger Bands. If one set fails, the other
set will alert to a problem, an unexpected market development. Unexpected mar-
ket developments occur all the time so it’s essential to always be ready.
Indicators such as the Baltic Exchange, the SDR, and COT reports have
a worth for capturing consistent profi ts as much as a trading indicator because
of its market alert to future price moves.
The purpose of this chapter was not only to highlight indicators that
work to capture profi ts but to outline currency pairs and their movements. My
hope is that this was a consistent theme throughout the book. This chapter
focused on two consistent themes, trading indicators and market indicators.
Each have a value of equal worth. One alerts to future market conditions and
periods while the other alerts to price moves. One complements the other.
Trading indicators together complement each other. Simple moving averages
complement Ichimoku because simple moving averages focus on closing
prices while Ichimoku focuses on market highs and lows. It’s a continuous-
market moving average.
Bollinger Bands work together with pivot points as a pivot-point support
or resistance line may align to a band’s support or resistance line. All indica-
tors can be employed with a trend line whether it is a speed line, a regression
line, or trend lines that comprise a channel. Different trend lines can be drawn
simultaneously. A regression line complements a speed line.
Conclusion
My purpose for this book was to address the various issues involved that
comprise a currency pair not only from a strict trading perspective but to
bring an understanding from a whole host of perspectives. Part was historic

to understand the full context for trade and approach the markets. To know
where we were may help to know where we are.
The real purpose for my book is to understand the second side of a
currency-pair equation so a pair is fully understood for its purpose, history,
movements, and factors that make it move. Armed with this information, it is
my hope that this book will be a continuous resource for not only those that
know, understand, and trade the markets but for those who wish to learn,
for some to be better at their craft. For those who wish to capture consistent
profi ts with a full comprehension of market factors, much exists in this book
for you.
