Welcome!
Do you want to become a successful
binary options trader?
You are in the right place. In this e-book you will be
introduced to the top 10 binary options strategies. As well
as picking the most effective and easy-to-use strategies out
there, we have presented them in a fun visual manner that
is easy to understand, even if you don’t have much
experience.
Some binary option traders play the markets without any
solid strategies. We however, strongly recommend
mastering at least a couple of strategies and trading only
when strategy indicators are clear. By doing so you can not
only reduce your risk, but also significantly increase any
profits.
That said, always be aware of the other factors that drive
markets, don’t just follow indicators blindly!
And Remember that it’s okay to have losses – as long as
more of your trades are ‘In the Money’ than ‘Out of the
Money’.

Fundamentals Why Binary
Why Binary options are becoming more
and more popular?
Simplicity
Binary options are generally simpler to trade than
other instruments. This is because you only need to
form a view on what direction the price of the
underlying asset will move. In comparison, traditional
options also require you to form a view on the
magnitude of any price movement.
Fast outcome
Binary options offer contracts with short-term
durations, from 60 seconds to 60 minutes. This
provides the trader with several investment
opportunities during a day. It also offers flexibility as
markets change over time.
Less risk
With the forex market, every time you enter into a
trade you risk the entire amount of money in your
trading account. With binary options, however, your
risk is always limited to the amount you committed to
that specific trade.
Multiple asset classes
A trader can access multiple asset classes such as
stocks, currencies, indices and commodities, and can
usually trade them whenever a market is open some-
where in the world.
No fees
Unlike with other trading instruments, there are
usually no fees or commissions attached to binary
options. Brokers make their money from the
percentage discrepancy between what they pay out on
winning trades and what they collect from losing
trades.

Some brokers, however, let you minimize risks by
choosing the payout and loss percentage you want.
For example, you can choose to lose only 75% in the
event that your view is incorrect. With such an
option, you would also have to accept a lower win
percentage.

One of the most important aspects when trading binary options is to know when to trade the market. Even though
trading on foreign exchange options, stock options, commodity options and index options is available 24 -hours a
day, five days a week, not every hour or minute is worth trading. There are different hours during the day and differ-
ent days of the week which see more volume and liquidity than others, resulting in high volatility and oppor-
tunities to maximize trading.

Fundamentals Expiry time
What time frame to choose for trading
binary options
When it comes to trading binary options, you have a variety of choices for what kind of time frame (time until
expiry) to trade in. the majority of binary options, however, have expiry times ranging from 60 seconds to 30
minutes.

on fundamentals. You will also want to look at 15

view of the technical factors surrounding the asset.
Fundamental analysis will help you here, but 30
minutes is still short enough that you can’t neglect
the technical side of things. Looking at both of these
things will give you a much more complete picture
of how an asset will perform over this longer time
period.
What time-frame to use for the pattern recognition
In order to confirm a trend, use a candlestick chart with a bigger time frame than the one you use to decide your
expiry time. it is usually recommended to use a time frame of at least 1 hour for chart pattern recognition. short-
term traders, however, may choose to use 1-minute and 15-minute candlestick charts. The 1-minute chart provides
entry and exit signals while the 15-minute and hourly charts are used to confirm the trend and support and resist-
ance levels. If you trade binary options with 15-minute or 30-minute expiry times, 1-hour and 4-hour candlestick
charts can be used to determine/confirm your view.
