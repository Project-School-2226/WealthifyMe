Characteristic Discussion
Downward price trend The short-term price trend leading to a double bottom is down.
Two valleys Look for two valleys that bottom near the same price. Near means within about 5 percent.
The bottoms should look as if they are at the same price.
Valley separation The time between bottoms varies, but two to seven weeks results in the best performance.
Peak The peak between the two bottoms should measure at least 10 percent, but exceptions
are numerous, making this guideline almost useless.
Volume Volume is higher on the left bottom than the right, but this is an observation, not a requirement.
Confi rmation Price must close above the highest peak between the two bottoms. If price closes below
the lowest bottom before confi rmation, it invalidates the double bottom.

wider, more rounded turns. Each valley tends to look similar to the others.
Same price Each minor low should bottom near the same price. Rarely will all three bottom at exactly the

Volume Volume recedes, meaning it is higher on the left than the right, but each bottom can show
