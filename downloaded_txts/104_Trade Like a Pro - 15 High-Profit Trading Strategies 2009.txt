I n 2000, approximately nine years ago, I released my first book, Futures
for Small Speculators. This book was meant to be a repudiation of all
of the misinformation that investors were receiving from brokers and
the industry. I was angry at how many and how often investors were losing
their money trading. I realized that losing was the norm for them and when
they did make money, they had a difficult time replicating their success.
Since then I have put out six publications-this being the sixth-and while
my anger has subsided, my hope is still to see investors readily able to trade
successfully.
This book is a logical extension of the book, Winning the Trading
Game. That book broke down the three components of successful trading:
money management, technical analysis, and risk management. After it was
completed, I realized that to clarify the distinction between risk manage
ment and money management, I would have to write another book. I knew
this book would have to break down as many risk management techniques
as possible- in clear concise terms- with as many chart examples as I
could muster. I also needed to point out to stock investors, forex investors,
and futures investors that risk management transcends trading genres, and
in order to trade like professionals, they need to cross those barriers with
out hesitation.
Things have changed so much in the industry in the last decade, with
new exchanges, the weakening dollar, the growth of China and India,
and the creation of new tradable instruments like contracts for difference
(CFD). All of this change means more opportunities to profit. The old way
of looking at futures as too risky or of trading stocks with 100 percent
cash has become more fluid. This book is designed to help you make that
adjustment.
This book has 15 risk management strategies in two parts. There are
nine basic strategies, originally discussed in Winning the Trading Game,
and now, in Trade like a Pro, analyzed more in depth. In addition, there
are six advanced risk management strategies, that build on that knowledge.

Finally. ..... how you how to put the two sets of strategies to use to
of uccess.
book can teach you techniques on how to manage risk, it
really cannot make you money, nor can it lose you money. Only your intel
ligent reaction to the markets can do that and these tools are designed to
help you make those intelligent decisions. You still need to have a trading
plan, trading goals, a well-kept trading journal, and a sound money man
agement plan, win or lose.
Your dedication to the craft of trading is constantly tested by the
demons of fear and greed. It is always tempting to go for a magic bullet,
but if it exists-I have yet to find it. Trading is difficult and requires a set
plan, built around discipline and perseverance. My book helps you erect
and maintain that plan and face the losses that occur with confidence.
Good fortune and good luck in all of your trading endeavors.

Acknowledgments
This book was very difficult to complete in the face of my personal
adversity. Like so many other people I was affected by the economic
downturns in the real estate market as well. Couple that with the re
sponsibilities that come with being a single father and I could have been
overwhelmed at any time. My faith in God not only sustained me, but
helped me thrive. I definitely want to acknowledge and thank God for his
presence in my life and the constant blessings I have received, which in
cludes all of the wonderful people that have strived to help me both pro
fessionally and personally.
As a single father, I really would like to thank my two sons, Alex and
Zach. When I am writing, they may as well be writing too since they are
directly affected by it. I appreciate their love and their patience in dealing
with my odd writing hours and intense work schedule. I also want to thank
Lori for being a part of this process, again. You are so loving, supportive,
and encouraging. Just by having you around, you definitely made the writ
ing process go easier. I also want to thank my mom, Celestine. You have
made me smile and laugh throughout the process and your calls to check
up on my writing helped get me to the finish line.
I also want to thank Meg Freeborn and Emilie Herman. Editors ex
traordinaire! You both have made my writing shine. Not being a writer by
trade has meant a lot of reliance on your notes and recommendations on
how to improve the manuscript, all of which have helped the quality of my
writing.
Without question, I must also acknowledge one of my favorite places
to write, Portfolio Coffeehouse. I have been writing there since 1994. Many
of my articles, large sections of my books, and a significant amount of my
ideas have come while sitting there sipping on a cup of black tea. Thanks.
Finally, I'd like to thank all of my colleagues, clients, customers, sup
porters, and friends for your constant prayers and well wishing. Your en
couragement and positive energy is greatly valued.

Designing
the Trade
The next few chapters layout a set of ideas and concepts that help you
make the transition from a retail trader to a professional one. Pro
fessional traders approach the market with three distinct differences
that their retail counterparts don't have to consider.
First, the majority of professional traders are working for someone
else. This means that they have what is known as a fiduciary responsibil
ity to their clients. They must, at all times, act in the best interest of their
clients at all times. This means that when choosing between risk and re
wards, managing risk takes precedence in order to preserve the client's
principal.
Second, professional traders don't get paid unless their clients get paid.
While this can be stressful, it is the only way to keep the professional
traders focused on what's important-making their clients money. This
philosophy creates a spirit of cooperation in which everyone wins. If the
client doesn't make money, then the trader doesn't make money. This is a
simple philosophy that should be embodied in all forms of investing.
Finally, professional traders are looking for returns that are meant to
beat stock and bond returns, not necessarily to break the bank. For anyone
who has ever played baseball, you know that you don't hit for the fences
every time you are up at bat. In fact, you always take into consideration
what has happened before and what will happen after your tum. That
might require you to be conservative or loose with your playing, depending

on the situation. Trading is no different. Historically stocks have returned
12 percent annually and bonds have returned 7 percent; any program that
beats these returns is considered a success.
The ability to set aside greed is one of the professional trader's biggest
assets. If done correctly, setting realistic goals does not hinder opportuni
ties; it simply diminishes the need to take unnecessary chances for unlikely
rewards.
When a retail trader recognizes that he has a fiduciary responsibility to
himself, pays himself from his profits, and makes greed take a backseat to
the reality of the situation, he has taken some solid steps to trading like a
professional.

From Retail
Trader to
Professional
Trader
October: This is one of the particularly dangerous
months to invest in stocks. Other dangerous months
are July, January, September, April, November,
May, March, June, December, August, and February.
-Mark Twain
When it comes to the futures and forex markets, it is important to
understand the difference between trading and investing. The fast
paced nature ofthese markets, the high degree ofleverage, and the
limited nature of the contracts (from a few days to a few months) make it
difficult to invest in them for the long haul. It takes a significant amount of
active involvement in these markets to have even a chance at being suc
cessful. This means that as an investor you have two mental transitions to
make. The first transition is your ability to change a buy-and-hold mentality
to a buy-and-hold-as-Iong-as-I-need-to mentality. The second transition is to
make the leap from approaching the market like a retail trader to approach
ing the market like a professional trader. Let's tackle the first transition.
Investopedia defines a trader as "an individual who engages in the
transfer of financial assets in any financial market, either for themselves,
or on behalf of someone else." It further states that "the main difference
between a trader and an investor is the duration for which the person
holds the asset. Investors tend to have a longer term time horizon where as
traders tend to hold assets for shorter periods of time in order to capitalize
on short-term trends."
While all investors who make the transition to futures and forex be
lieve that they are traders who focus on profiting from short-term trends, it

==================================================

4 DESIGNING THE TRADE
quickly comes to light that they really do not !mow how to do it properly. In
my last book, Winning the Trading Game, chapter after chapter was de
voted to dispelling classic stock market beliefs and busting various myths
that can be fatal to would-be traders. While the transition from investor to
trader is not easy, it can be accomplished through planning and a constant
vigilance of your mental attitude.
The second mental transition is a lot more difficult. Taking the leap
from the mentality of a retail trader to that of a professional trader is one
of the most difficult, yet rewarding, transitions any trader can make. While
there is nothing inherently more difficult about being a professional trader,
there are several factors, both personal and market oriented, that the retail
trader needs to take into consideration.
It is often said that the difference between amateurs and professionals
is that professionals get paid for their work. It is the same in the trading
industry. The professionals are typically paid a salary plus a bonus based
on their performance. While for many of them this setup is well-deserved,
for others, not so much.
From a December 18th, 2007, news report on Bloomberg, Goldman
Sachs announced a bonus pool of $12.1 billion, up 23 percent from the
prior year. Some of the top officers were expected to receive bonuses
in excess of $60 million, with average compensation per employee to
reach $661,490. What makes Goldman Sachs significant is that they are
one of the few investment banking firms that generate a significant por
tion of their revenue from their own in-house trading operations. This
is no small feat for a company with a market capitalization of over
$74 billion.
Your average retail trader is lucky if he can put together $50,000 to
trade, much less the $9 billion that Goldman Sachs has allotted in its own
fund, GS Capital Partners. This type of disparity between the Goldman
Sachs's of the world, professional traders, and you, the retail trader, leads
many to believe that the leap from retail trader to professional trader is not
only difficult, but impossible.
This is the wrong way to think. If simply the amount of trading capital
available to professional traders is what separates them from retail traders,
then we wouldn't see so many so-called professional firms having difficul
ties. In just the past few years we have seen two huge fiascoes. We have
seen a $6 billion meltdown occur at the Amaranth hedge fund in the natu
ral gas market and a $7 billion loss at Societe Generale SA, each of them
collapsing because of the actions of just one of their traders. These were
both preceded by the well-publicized collapse of Barings Bank at the hands
of Nicholas Leeson in 1995. These large losses prove time and time again
that it's not just the amount of money you have to work with that makes
you a professional.



==================================================
                     PAGE 19                      
==================================================

From Retail Trader to Professional Trader 5
In each one of these public debacles it is clear that the "traders"
working for these companies were far from professional when it counted
the most. Their motivations, financial attitude, and psychological makeup
made them operate more like amateurs with access to a lot of money, as
opposed to professional traders with a strict agenda and plan. These prob
lems were further exacerbated by the lack of basic corporate checks and
balances.
In this chapter we explore what it takes to transition from a retail
trader to a professional one. We gain insight into professional traders' mo
tivations, financial savvy, and the psychological differences from most re
tail traders. Successful professional traders are supposed to operate with
constraint and discipline and have loss minimization at the forefront of
their market trading strategy. We look to replicate this mindset for retail
traders. Finally, we review the impact that outside accountability to reg
ulatory bodies, clients, and peers plays in keeping the professional trader
honest and the significant amount of pressure on professional traders to
simply do things right.
By mimicking the same high level of responsibility that professional
traders feel, retail traders can accurately assess their strengths and limi
tations while developing the necessary attitude it takes to trade in this in
creasingly competitive market environment. By taking a proactive role in
acting like a successful professional trader, you can make a realistic assess
ment of whether you should be trading or if you should hire a professional
trader to work for you.
There is little doubt that the market is becoming more saturated every
day. With trading competition going global and a huge breadth of contracts
strewed across every time zone, you need a competitive edge. To not only
survive, but thrive in this ever-changing environment, it is imperative that
you, the retail trader, take a page out of the professional trader's handbook
and ultimately tighten up your approach to the markets.
TRANSITIONING FROM RETAIL TRADER
TO PROFESSIONAL TRADER
They say "money can't buy happiness," but the appropriate extension to
that is "nor can it tum you into a professional trader." As a retail trader,
the secret to transitioning to a professional trader is not about how much
money you bring to the table but a combination of your motivation, how
you deal with the money you have, and your mindset. From the outset you
must ask yourself the million-dollar question, "Are you more interested in
being right or being profitable?" The stage is set for your ultimate success



==================================================
                     PAGE 20                      
==================================================

6 DESIGNING THE TRADE
or failure depending on how you answer this question, and your answer
will guide your motivations, how you manage your capital, and how you
mentally approach the market.
Many retail traders assume three things about professional traders
that are simply not true. First, they assume that almost every trade that
professional traders pick is a winner. Second, they assume that it takes
a lot of money to be a professional trader. Finally, they assume that
professional traders are secretly doing something that can't possibly be
done by retail traders.
None of these assumptions is correct and in fact we see time and
time again that it isn't the number of winning trades you pick, how much
money you have, or your privileged access to contracts that makes the
difference- it is how you behave.
Motivation
So are you more interested in being right or being profitable? Answer
carefully.
When asked this question, many people's knee-jerk response is to say
"profitable." What makes this strange is that they oftentimes do the oppo
site. They would rather pick the right market direction, regardless of how
fruitful the move itself may be. Then they will find any reason to support
their market-picking prowess; while the market is prepared for a reversal
or has actually gone in the opposite direction.
What motivates you more, being right or being profitable? This is a cru
cial question you must not only ask yourself, but also listen to your heart's
answer intently in order to make the transition from retail to professional
trader. The majority of retail traders are conditioned to believe that being
right about the market's direction is the same as being profitable. Every
advertisement on TV and trading system touts the percentage of success
fully picked trades. Whether they are real world results or hypothetical
scenarios (which are more likely), many gurus do their best to optimize
the results of the system they are promoting in order to boost the number
of successful picks over the number of losing ones.
You only notice a kink in any of these programs when you run the num
bers yourself. While the programs appear to be highly successful, it quickly
becomes apparent that there is a schism between the number of successful
picks and the actual amount of money made. In black and white you can
see that when the system fails, it really fails. Although there are allegedly
fewer losing picks than winning ones, the amounts of the losses can add
up to being greater than any individual win. You soon realize that not only
are there significantly more losses than wins, but if you were to incur them
at the wrong time in the system your account would be wiped out, and you
could never realize the potential pyramided profits that the programs tout.



==================================================
                     PAGE 21                      
==================================================

From Retail Trader to Professional Trader 7
The Commodities Futures Trading Commission and the National fu
tures Association have developed regulations to make sure that these pro
grams state "past results are not indicative of future returns" and clearly
show the difference between hypothetical and actual results. Nevertheless,
the average retail trader consciously or subconsciously equates the num
ber of times that a system successfully picks the market's direction with
how successful the system is at making money, which are not necessarily
the same thing.
The need to correctly pick the market's direction can quickly deterio
rate into an almost obsessive fixation with beating the market. There is a
need to anthropomorphize the markets into a person or entity that has feel
ings and emotions and that you are attempting to outwit. In this way you
make the markets into your own personal archvillain. Somehow, by your
wits alone, you can become more clever, faster, or insightful than your foe,
the amorphous unemotional market you are attempting to beat. This is sim
ply not the case. The market makes you money and the market loses you
money, on its own terms, in its own ways. No matter how successful you
are at picking the market, it can switch direction at any time. That alone
makes it important to fixate on the success of the trade itself, not necessar
ily on how well you picked it.
A trader who fixates on market picking gets only one thing- that warm
fuzzy feeling of being right- while missing the fact that the success of a
trade comes from the ability to manage the trade itself. The constant insis
tence that you be right about every trade you pick is a common mistake
of retail traders. The approach to being right about the market's direction
over being profitable rarely leads to success. In fact, it does quite the op
posite; it pits the trader against the very system he hopes to make money
from. The constant struggle ends up clouding the trader's judgment and
driving him to treat the market as an adversary that must be battled as
opposed to an ally that he is sharing opportunities with.
Needing to be right about the market's direction rather than being prof
itable is not the domain of just the retail trader. Professional traders can
find themselves on the wrong side as well, focusing on getting the market
right as opposed to being profitable.
Following are some examples of traders who chose being right over
being profitable.
In 1974 Dany Dattel of Herstatt Bank lost a total of $360 million
(unadjusted for inflation) trading the USDIDEM. Clearly one of the
first, if not the first, currency trading meltdowns, Dattel's actions
led to the collapse of Herstatt Bank, originally founded in 1792
(Borse Online, www.graumarktinfo.de/gm/grauestars/firmen/dickedinger/:
Herstatt-BankDany-Dattel-und-die-DM-Deals/493304.html).
In 1994 Robert Citron drove one of the most prosperous counties in
the nation into bankruptcy. Citron used derivatives to support his bet that

interest rates would not increase. If not for the fact that he was using the
county's money, his mistake would not have been noticed. Instead Cit
ron lost his interest rate bets to the tune of $1. 7 billion. Orange County,
California, had to file bankruptcy and cut back on various municipal ser
vices for years in order to recover, solely because of Citron's actions

0,9171,982029,00.html).
The need to be right about the market's direction is an endemic dis
ease of the industry. While we would hope that traders and companies
would learn from mistakes made a decade or two ago, we still see the
same patterns repeating themselves, from Amaranth Advisors losing big
in the natural gas market, Barings Bank taking a nose dive in the Nikkei
futures market, to Societe Generale losing the most money to date, trading
European Index futures. In each instance the management was willing to
tum a blind eye to the activities of their traders as long as they kept get
ting the right picks, but they were quickly ready to abandon them and label
them rogue traders when they were no longer picking the right markets.
Instead of putting the necessary safeguards in place that would protect the
banks or hedge funds from loss, management operated with the belief that
it was good enough to have someone who could pick the right trade.
This was just such a case at Amaranth Advisors. In 2005 their trader
Brian Hunter had made enormous profits, to the tune of $3 billion, in nat
ural gas market spreads. The impact that Hurricane Katrina had in halting
the Gulf region's ability to refine oil played a significant part in Hunter's
success. While he had successfully called the market in 2005, when he at
tempted to do it a second time he got it all wrong. The spread trades that
he had set up for 2007 and 2008 quickly deteriorated, and Amaranth lost
$6.5 billion. The need to be right about the market's direction led Hunter to
purchase and hold illiquid contracts far past their prime.
Had Amaranth's positions simply been on the other side of the
market, they would have made $6.5 billion. Had they used a proper
hedge to protect themselves against being wrong, they may have only
lost a fraction of the $6.5 billion that put them out of business. Had
Amaranth simply prepared for the possibility of their trade picker
not being right about the markets this time, the story would have
ended completely differently. This is the benefit of having 20/20 hind
sight ("Betting on the Weather and taking an Ice Cold Bath," New
York Times, www.nytimes.com/2006/09/29lbusiness/29insider.html?-1'=
1&oref=slogin).
The same thing happened to Barings Bank. Nicholas Leeson originally
made trades that were quite profitable for Barings. The first set of profits
he racked up accounted for 10 percent of the bank's entire annual income.
In hopes that he could duplicate his success, he was allowed to execute

==================================================

From Retail Trader to Professional Trader 9
riskier and riskier strategies, while at the same time secretly hiding various
losses that he was accumulating. While the fraud is inexcusable, Barings
was suffering from the same fixation that Amaranth was, being right about
the market's direction as opposed to being profitable (Rogue Trader by
Nicholas Leeson, Little Brown and Company 1996).
Most recently in the news we have seen Societe Generale lose the
equivalent of $ 7.1 billion. Jerome Kerviel has been painted as a rogue trader
who acted on his own in racking up the largest losses in history. As of this
writing, more information is coming out about Kerviel's "rogue trading." If
Kerviel is to be believed, two tidbits of information stand out: first, his ag
gressive trading style was practiced by all the traders at the firm and was
tacitly encouraged by the management's turning a blind eye to it; second, in
the previous year, Kerviel, using similar, if not the exact same, tactics had
made the bank $2 billion. If it is found to be true that his trading activity di
rectly led to $2 billion being added to Societe Generale's bottom line, then
his trading activity will be seen in a completely different light, and Societe
Generale will be seen as more of an accomplice to this debacle than a vic
tim ("Rogue Traders a Nightmare Scenario for Finance CEOs," ABC News,
http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=42057 67 &page= 1).
By no stretch of the imagination can anyone believe that the men
caught in these situations acted professionally. While they operated un
der the auspices of professional traders, they behaved like amateurs. If
major banks and hedge funds, with billions of dollars on the line, can
make the mistake of believing that being right about the market's direction
takes precedence over being profitable, how can the average retail trader
avoid it? More importantly, what does it mean to be profitable in the mar
kets? And is being right about the markets that bad?
Choosing Being Profitable Over Being Right
Lefty Gomez, baseball Hall of Famer, said it best: "I'd rather be lucky than
good." The failure of many retail traders is their insistence that being right
is good trading; this leads them to ignore the fact that their terribly success
ful trade was simply the luck of being at the right place at the right time.
Separating being right from being profitable takes a mental shift in
what you believe trading is truly all about. It is easy to let your ego get
wrapped up in enjoying how smart you are and in knowing the right an
swer to any problem. All throughout school, from grade school to graduate
school, we are rewarded for picking the right answer, whether it's multiple
choice or free response; as long as we write down the right answers for the
teacher or professor we guarantee ourselves that we will get the "A."
Our society doesn't encourage playing it safe or any form of medi
ocrity. If you write a paper that is less than stellar, or you are a "c" student

10 DESIGNING THE TRADE
in school, it is assumed that you aren't living up to your potential. That type
of behavior is simply not tolerated. Being normal or average in any way is
considered a shame.
Add up all of the constant positive reinforcement you get when you
get things right, the rejections of mediocrity, along with a constant diet of
the perseverance pop psychology that we are all subjected to ("No guts, no
glory," "No pain, no gain," "It ain't over until the fat lady sings"), and the
surprise is not that traders have failed in the past; it's that more of them
haven't failed a lot worse.
As long as you are motivated by the need to successfully pick the mar
ket's direction you will be plagued by the inability to trade like a pro
fessional. In fact, you will be committing the same mistakes that Hunter,
Citron, Dattel, Kerviel, and Leeson all committed against their employers.
Your mistakes may not make headlines like theirs did, but you will be do
ing it to yourself, a type of rogue trading. You will work at cross purposes
against your desire to be profitable in your trading. The goal is to strive to
be profitable at all costs and sometimes that can be accomplished in the
most simplest of ways.
Being profitable over being right doesn't mean you don't want to
choose markets well; far from it. Every trade has three potential scenar
ios: profit, loss, and breakeven. If you have only one possible scenario,
profit, in mind when you start you have negated two-thirds of your poten
tial outcomes. This in tum eliminates how much preparation you put into
protecting yourself against the other two scenarios.
Yet this is exactly what happens when traders choose to be right. By
fixating on the end goal of profits at all cost, a type of tunnel vision envelops
the trader. All new information about the situation, new twists and turns
of the market, as well as fundamental shifts in supply and demand, are
ignored or thrown out the window leaving the trader with a fixation on his
original goal rather than having the flexibility to change.
A penny saved is a penny earned.
-Ben Franklin
The decision to be profitable over being right can lead a trader into
making a different set of choices about how he interacts with the markets.
By deciding to be profitable, plans are put in place to protect yourself from
one trading potential-loss-and to help you bring about another trading
potential more often-breakeven, or as close to breake ven as possible.
When it comes to trading futures and forex there is a professional class
of traders: Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs). This class of traders is
similar to the mutual fund managers of stocks. They have more strict re
porting requirements than their Hedge Fund counterparts, but are able to



==================================================
                     PAGE 25                      
==================================================

From Retail Trader to Professional Trader 11
be involved in various highly aggressive investment arenas, futures-forex
OTC and options, that their stock market counterparts wish they could par
ticipate in. These CTAs are what is considered the gold standard of com
modities and forex trading.
Regulated CTAs, as a rule, must write down their strategies, have a
specific risk of ruin structure, and halt their trading at specific loss levels.
On top of all that, they have various reporting requirements and must show
that they can produce a return if they claim they can. The statistics that
surround the success of this group can be practically underwhelming.
It is said that out of ten trades they may have six trades that are losers,
two trades that are marginal winners or breakeven, and two bona fide home
runs. Where their success lies is not in their winners. It is in their abil
ity to minimize the losses on the six losing trades, and, more importantly,
their ability to have any breakeven trades at all. By keeping themselves well
guarded on those eight trades, they set themselves up for the home runs to
find them. When the professional traders maintain and preserve as much
capital as possible, it keeps the odds of success within their grasp.
The success of CT As comes from their ability to waste little precious
time in the trading dead ends. Knowing when to admit they're wrong,
quickly, is an essential trading skill, oftentimes more important than being
right about the market's direction. By minimizing the need to be right, they
are able to focus on the trades that aren't being successful and take the nec
essary corrective action to end the trade or tum it into a breakeven trade.
This is what is meant about being profitable- trading to control the
most probable outcome loss, and letting the profits take care of themselves.
While it might not be the most glamorous approach to trading, it is the
most empowering way to approach it. Focusing on being profitable frees
you from the need to always be right when picking the markets to trade,
it helps you prepare for the potential losses, and lets the potential profits
take care of themselves.
Money
What does money mean to you?
Does money mean freedom, opportunity, nothing, everything, choice?
Your relationship to money will be reflected in your trading. Whether you
hold on to losing trades or cut your losses quickly will be a clear example of
what the capital you are trading with represents to you. If you are chasing
trades, cutting your profits short, or pyramiding your contracts with little
or no safety net, you are acting out your hidden money desires.
When retail traders come to trading they have one goal in mind: Make
as much money as possible. There is no question in their mind that they
are in the ideal environment that will help all their dreams come true. The

==================================================

12 DESIGNING THE TRADE
problem with pinning such high hopes on trading is that how they approach
the money they bring to trading will be directly affected in their trading.
There is a precarious balance of caring too much and caring too little.
On the one hand, if you care too much about the money you bring to
the markets, it makes it difficult to make trades. You become afraid that
every trade you take will wipe you out. Once you finally enter the markets
you assume that the trade you are in has got to pan out-so you hold on to
it a little too long and you lose some, if not all, of your money on the trade.
You chase markets so you don't miss out on opportunities, even if they are
long past.
Caring for your capital too much can be fatal. It is a quick road to dis
aster. Yet many retail traders do just that. It all stems from the simple fact
that they aren't bringing risk capital to the table. The money that they are
using for trading is money they really can't afford to lose. So they operate
from a deep fear of losing all their capital. This inevitably leads them to
bringing their fear to life.
The combination of caring for your capital too much and the fear of los
ing it is prevalent in trading. No one is immune to it. Even traders at large
institutions, as we discussed earlier, get caught on this negative money cy
cle. The trick is not to ignore that these emotions can influence you, but to
recognize that these feelings may be overwhelming and you won't be able
to simply trade through them. You may actually have to halt your trading
to gain perspective on the situation.
Caring too little for your capital is the other side of the same coin.
When you care too little for your capital, you operate as if you were in Las
Vegas. You are willing to take every bet no matter how long the odds are,
hoping for your long shot to come in. This approach to money foments a
belief in the big score. Trading and treating the markets as one giant slot
machine, with each pull of the trade trigger you are looking for the out-of
the-balI-park return, with little regard to the process and 100 percent focus
on the outcome.
This is the type of trader who constantly gives his profits back to the
market. This is the type of trader who will constantly fund his trading ac
count with little realization that it isn't the market that keeps losing him
money; it's his approach. This is the type of trader who will eventually
give up trading with a lot of good war stories, but will claim that trading
is rigged.
The quickest way to trading burnout is caring too much or caring too
little for your capital. Each approach can be an exhausting way to trade
that leaves you drained, dazed, and confused at how you got to where you
are in your trading. In order to trade like a professional trader, you have to
take a different approach to what the markets mean to you in relation to
the capital you put in and what you hope to achieve.

Demo Trading
As a trader sometimes there is a need to reboot. Professional traders are
never afraid to reinvent themselves. They will come up with new systems
or new trading tactics when they become aware that their trading results
have halted. They will run various computer and back testing models. The
simplest way for retail traders to accomplish the same result is to halt their
trading and shift from live trading to paper trading.
While it is not a secret that the market can move up, down, or side
ways, it appears to elude retail traders that they don't always need to be
trading. They can be short, long, or fiat the market. Being fiat the market
is a valid position. While you may not be making money, you are also not
losing money. This special fiat time can be spent paper trading or demo
trading online.
Demo trading has the ability to help you practice the proper trading
techniques and build your confidence. Many traders abandon their demo
trading once they open a real account, and this is the exact opposite of
their professional counterparts. By maintaining both concurrently you will
be able to catch yourself when you are making mistakes, move over to your
demo trading account, improve your trading, and switch right back over to
real trading without breaking stride.
As long as you stay a student of the markets it becomes difficult to get
caught in the trap that the money you are working with is in control of your
actions. The money becomes a tool to your needs that you neither care too
little nor too much about. You are working toward your end goals without
the frantic desire to be right, just profitable. Successful hunting requires
that we practice shooting at targets just as often, if not more often, than
we shoot at actual ganle.
Trading with the Right Amount of Capital
As a trader you are fighting with whether or not you are trading with the
right amount of capital that can help you achieve your goals. The stark
naked truth is that you are not trading with enough capital. The majority of
retail traders should not be utilizing all of the leverage available to them in
futures and forex trading. In forex trading the leverage can be as high 500
to 1. This is far beyond what the average retail trader should be working
with when he gets started. When it comes to futures trading you can be
trading as high as 50 to 1.
These high levels of trading leverage are a leading contributor to a
retail trader's rapid demise. It is difficult to tum down the leverage but
a sense of balance must be achieved. For traders who are afraid that
they will lose their money, they are trading at leverage far and above



==================================================
                     PAGE 28                      
==================================================

14 DESIGNING THE TRADE
what they can handle. This is a dangerous position to be in. It makes
your mistakes a lot more critical. When you lose, you lose big, while
at the same time making it difficult for you to get your trades right be
cause you are fixated on the fact that you might lose all or most of your
money.
For those who care too little for the capital they are trading with, the
huge fluctuations in their account's capital have to be managed. The easiest
way to find a balance is to come up with a strategy to adjust the leverage
when you are trading as a way to reflect your actual trading streak and to
help you retain your profits as you trade along.
There are different ideal account amounts bandied about in the trading
world. They range from 5 to 10 percent of your overall investments to as
little as a few hundred dollars. The old adage used to be that you should
trade with enough capital that when you go to bed at night you can sleep,
but not sleep well. If you can't sleep at all you are trading with too much
money; if you can sleep like a baby you are trading with too little.
On the surface this advice seems to be a little vague, but it is still quite
appropriate. There are many factors that go into what makes trading com
fortable for you. If you have too much money on the line you will find your
self at a trading disadvantage; if you have too little you find yourself at a
trading disadvantage.
Finding a balance between the two requires that you understand how
much the actual value of the futures and forex contracts are and add the
necessary capital to your account that will not wipe you out in one trade,
but will also not diminish the capital returns you were going for when you
entered the markets.
There is no magic number. You can cut your leverage in half by dou
bling the amount of capital committed to your trade or you can put up all of
the money for the contract. No matter how you do it, realize that the lever
age that you are able to use is not set in stone, and that is the maximum
leverage available. Manipulate the leverage to your liking.
Psychology
Understanding why you do what you do as well as how you will treat your
operating capital is important. Just as important is understanding what is
going on behind the scenes of your mind. There are emotions of fear and
greed to overcome. They can make you operate and act in ways you don't
really want to. They can bounce you around in a reactionary state, forcing
you to go from a bad choice to an even worse choice. Controlling these
two emotions is difficult and the only way to really do it is to be aware of
them when they arise and to have a plan on how you will trade regardless
of them.



==================================================
                     PAGE 29                      
==================================================

From Retail Trader to Professional Trader 15
There is another emotion that is just as insidious but probably twice
as bad as fear and greed. On the surface you can comprehend fear, a self
preservation instinct, and greed, our need to attain more. But when these
two emotions fuse together to fuel the emotion of ego, watch out.
WordNet defines ego as "an inflated feeling of pride in your superiority
to others."
Dealing with this type of ego in your trading is dangerous and is the
place where retail traders get stuck in their transition to trading like a pro.
We touched a little bit on how the ego wants to be right about the markets
as opposed to being profitable. There is also a need for the ego to want to
prove its superiority, but this is difficult to do when you are dealing with
an amorphous entity like the markets.
Bizarre things begin to happen. The ego can force you to engage in
irrational behavior. You may attack the markets when you lose money;
this is known as revenge trading, which is usually counterproductive to
your goals of being profitable. Since the markets have no memory of
what happened yesterday, today, or tomorrow, the logical solution for
any trader is to come to the markets with a clean slate. The ego, which
feels slighted, will look for a way to get the market back for every little
transgression.
The ego doesn't stop there; once it has decided that the position it has
taken regarding a market is the right one, it will look for every piece of
supporting evidence, no matter how small, all of which may be contrary to
what is happening on the screen right in front of your eyes.
The ego also likes to feel like it can outsmart what is happening, so it
will often take an outright contrarian view of the markets and their direc
tion to show its superiority over the industry or its peers.
Finally, the ego will tell you that you are smarter than the system you
created. It will tell you that you are the creator so you are better than the
rules, trading plan, and back testing that you may have conducted in order
to get where you are. It will make sure you don't trust the paper trading
you have done to get where you are now, and that real trading is somehow
different.
The ego is the ultimate enemy of the trader, because it will tell you that
you are good and you will forget that your successes have been all about
luck. The ancient Roman philosopher Seneca said, "Luck is what happens
when preparation meets opportunity." By being properly prepared for the
trade (win, lose, or breakeven), when an opportunity arises you will be
there to take advantage of it.
The ego requires that it make everything happen. Somehow the ego
believes that only its most aggressive actions take precedence, while some
times trading simply needs the right set of circumstances for the opportu
nity to appear. If the ego is allowed to run amok there may never be enough

16 DESIGNING THE TRADE
capital left over to be able to take advantage of the various opportunities
that come your way.
The ego can make it difficult for the retail trader to succeed. The best
way to combat your ego is to have a plan and a way to document your
activity. The ego needs to know the difference between the facts and its
opinion of the facts. This is a crucial distinction that can only be brought to
light with due diligence. AE time progresses, the ego begins to know what
the truth is and its own effects become diminished.
This is one of the most difficult situations to overcome, but once ac
complished can make your transition to pro style trading seamless.
SUCCESSFUL PROFESSIONAL TRADERS
The shift from retail trader to professional trader is not easy. Although de
veloping strategies and techniques to make the transition can be difficult,
it is not impossible to develop the proper makeup to emulate. While there
have been several major professional trader blowups, those instances have
been the exception, not the rule. Professional traders break up their ap
proach to the markets in three components: discipline, loss control, and
planning.
Discipline
There are several great books discussing the minds of professional traders.
One of the earliest books that attempted to give a glimpse into this rar
efied world is The Merchant Bankers by Joseph Wechsler (Little Brown,
1966). This book breaks down every major banking family throughout his
tory. What makes the book particularly relevant to today's environment is
a small anecdote regarding a young banker.
A new young banker executed a trade to impress the partners. Soon
the position began to lose. Instead of getting out of the position right
away, the young banker held on to it. AE the trade continued to col
lapse, to the tune of 1 million pounds, the young banker, wringing his
hands, finally decides to approach one of the managing partners. AE he
begins to relate his tale of loss and is on the verge of handing in his
resignation, the partner stops him and asks him why he didn't come to
him sooner when the loss was manageable. The young banker had no
response.
The partner tells the young banker that he could have put the company
in serious jeopardy, and then reveals a secret to him. He had been watching
the young banker all along and had already put the necessary protective



==================================================
                     PAGE 31                      
==================================================

From Retail Trader to Professional Trader 17
trade in place, so that what looked like a 1 million pound loss for the young
banker was actually a small profit because the partner had already put a
counter hedging position into play earlier.
How many times have we been the young banker, caught in a losing
trade, not getting out when the losses are manageable, all the while
spiraling down in flames of deeper despair? Unfortunately, there is no
benevolent trading partner looking over our shoulder ready to correct our
mistakes to protect us from ourselves. We must divide our psyche up and
be both the young banker willing to take a chance and the managing part
ner able to see the devastating results that a potentially big loss can have
on us and our account.
Professional traders, CTAs, are required by law to be disciplined at
all times in their trading. They must operate as the managing partner 2417
because of the obligations that they have taken on. CTAs who are disci
plined enough to consistently apply the same techniques to their trades,
no matter what the market is doing or the number of trades they have
executed, are the ideal role models for retail traders who are willing to
take their trading seriously. Transitioning from the young banker, wringing
your hands in fear, requires that traders take the responsibility of stick
ing to their trading rules and risk management strategies, just as CT As do
every day.
CTAs from the outset have a set of rules that cover entries, exits, and
risk levels that they must adhere to in order to optimize their success and
minimize their losses. Adhering to these parameters requires a high level of
discipline and focus that comes from multiple layers of responsibility. They
have a responsibility to their investors, regulators, and even their families.
What makes the successful CT As unique is that they don't profit unless
their clients profit. This is what encourages CTAs to stick to their plan,
particularly if they believe it has worked in the past and can continue to
work in the future.
Retail traders must have a mental paradigm shift and see themselves
just like the CTAs. Identical to the setup that CTAs have, the vast major
ity of retail traders are only paid when there is a profit. Therefore, retail
traders can benefit from treating capital that they place in the markets the
same way that CTAs do. It is important that CTAs and retail traders both
optimize every opportunity by consistently adhering to their trading plan
and strategies.
This is the only way to succeed in the long run. The more faith you
can develop in your trading plan the easier it is to be disciplined to follow
it. The essential discipline also comes from the ability to be your own in
ner trading manager; in spite of your hopes that a trade may succeed, the
proper preparation to protect yourself from loss long before the situation
becomes dire is important.

==================================================

18 DESIGNING THE TRADE
Loss Control
It is no secret that when it comes to trading losses, the better you can
control them, the easier it will be for you to chase down potential profits.
As losses rack up you need more and more spectacular returns to recover
and then get into the green.
When the trading losses are unleveraged and straightforward, as in
stock trading, a 10 percent loss represents a need to gain 11 percent just to
get back to even (90 percent x 111 percent = 100 percent). If your leverage
is as high as 5 to 1 then that same 10 percent loss represents a 50 percent
loss. This means that you need a return of at least 200 percent (50 percent x
200 percent = 100 percent) just to get back to breakeven.
This means that your need to minimize your losses as quickly as possi
ble becomes imperative, if you hope to achieve any success. CT As typically
attempt to control their loss at a fixed percentage of no more than 2 percent
on any given trade. For accounts in the millions that can easily be done.
For smaller accounts, depending on the market and amount of leverage
you use, that can translate into as little as a 10 percent to as much as a 20
percent move in your actual account.
CTAs' conscious decision to minimize their losses dovetails directly
into how they calculate the success of their trading programs. When CTAs
set out to calculate their potential losses, they always attempt to find the
worse possible scenario of their trading program. They do this by calculat
ing their drawdowns and their maximum drawdowns.
Drawdown is defined as the peak-to-trough decline during a specific
record period of an investment, fund, or commodity. A drawdown is usu
ally quoted as the percentage between the peak and the trough.
The maximum drawdown is the largest drawdown experienced
by a strategy during a given time period (both definitions are from
Investopedia).
The drawdown and the potential maximum drawdown are numbers
that are consistently used by CTAs to help refine their trading programs and
to develop loss management strategies to help them protect themselves,
while at the same time maximizing their potential for trading returns. The
various percentages that can be developed by running multiple scenarios
and measuring possible drawdown amounts can be tremendously helpful,
but are not meant to be the gospel of your trading.
While on the surface these drawdown percentages can seem to be an
efficient way to determine how bad a program can fail you, there are a
few flaws. The primary one is that "past results are not indicative of fu
ture returns," so while past drawdowns can be calculated, shifts in sup
ply and demand can alter how future drawdowns and yet unseen potential
maximum drawdowns can occur. It becomes very important to understand



==================================================
                     PAGE 33                      
==================================================

From Retail Trader to Professional Trader 19
how the CTAs manage their losses while they are trading, not just pay at
tention to what they do when the worst case scenarios pop up; it is less
important to know how they react to the markets when a fundamental shift
in the marketplace has already occurred.
In spite of the problems that relying on drawdown calculations have,
retail traders rarely incorporate an understanding of how much of a return
on their investment they need when they lose, nor do they understand the
potential maximum drawdown facing them when they trade a market. This
is a huge oversight on their part that needs to be corrected.
Professor Thomas A. Hieronymous, an agricultural economist and the
grandfather of farm marketing through futures, conducted a study on spec
ulative (retail) trading accounts in the late sixties. Professor Hieronymous
came to a few disturbing conclusions in this study. The first assessment he
made was that 92 percent of the one-time traders would lose their money,
never to be heard from again. He then narrowed down his field of what
he called regular traders to those with more than 10 trades in a year and
losses or gains that exceeded $500. That left him with a total of 462 trad
ing accounts to analyze. In this group of accounts 298 had losses and 164
accounts showed a profit.
Based on this data the statistics for retail accounts are not promising.
Ninety-two percent of one-timers lose their money, then of those who are
left, two thirds of them have losing trades, and one third of them make a
profit. While these figures were compiled back in 1969 (excerpted from The
Futures Game: Who Wins? Who Loses and Why? by Richard J. Teweles
and Frank Joseph Jones), they still have relevance today.
Just as we looked at the effects that leverage has on the increased need
for an account to do exceptionally well after a loss, and we have developed
an understanding on how knowing your drawdown percentages can play
a factor in mitigating those losses, it is no wonder that the average retail
trader would rather shoot from the hip than figure out these key numbers
ahead of time. The problem with the shoot-from-the-hip approach is that it
is hazardous to the long-time survival of retail traders.
Another study, The Rockwell Study, followed a period of 18 years. Be
ginning with 1947, it was observed that small speculators (retail traders)
lost in 11 of their 18 trading years, their average loss being $15.1 million
and their average profits reaching $23.7 million. The large speculators, on
the other hand (CTAs-the pros), show a profit in 15 of their 18 trading
years. Their average yearly profit was approximately $13 million and their
average annual loss is only $3.4 million. The large speculators had over
twice as many winning years.
Another study was conducted by Bard Barber, DC Davis, and Terrance
Odean, DC Berkeley. In their 2004 white paper entitled "Do Individual Day
Traders Make Money?" they analyzed the accounts of 130,000 investors in

Taiwan, the twelfth largest financial market in the world, from 1995 to 1999.
Based on their research they discovered that in a typical six month period
more than eight out of ten day traders lose money. The core reason for the
traders' losses revolved around their basic inability to cut their losses and
ride their profits.
Even though the study itself focused on day trading stocks, it clearly
showed the lack of success of retail traders in the largest statistical group
sample ever compiled. While day trading stocks and commodities/forex
may have few similarities as trading instruments, the way in which stocks
are day traded parallels the time constrained nature of futures and forex
trading. It can be assumed that the sense of urgency found in futures and
forex contract expirations along with their leverage component is very
similar to day trading, and had the study been conducted on futures and
forex, it most likely would have yielded similar if not worse results than
Odean's study.
The reality is that for the past 60 years, from 1947 until the present,
retail traders from aU genres of trading have consistently lost more and
done worse than their professional counterparts. This can be primarily at
tributed to their completely different (or lack of) approach to controlling
their losses. If retail traders would take a similar view of loss to that of
their professional counterparts, they would not only improve their trading,
but actually tum trading on its ear.
Planning
The success of professional traders is not by accident-it is by design. By
focusing on mitigating the various ways that they can lose money, they
develop the necessary plans for success. Their stop losses and protec
tive strategies take into account their account value, drawdowns, max
imum drawdowns, and leverage. By combining each of these compo
nents together, a clear picture of their risk versus reward comes into
focus.
Professional traders are constantly developing plans and contingency
plans that incorporate various ways to minimize their losses. Since fu
tures and forex is known as a zero sum investment, losers pay the win
ners directly, the professional traders step up to the plate to make sure
they give themselves as many genuine opportunities to transfer wealth
to themselves, as well as minimizing the transfer of wealth away from
themselves.
This requires a fundamental understanding of all of the players
(hedgers, large speculators, and small speculators), as well as the tools at
their disposal (cash, OTe, forex, options, and futures). By watching the
footprints of their competitors and utilizing every tool in their arsenal,

==================================================

From Retail Trader to Professional Trader 21
professional traders are light years ahead of retail traders in protecting
their day-to-day survival.
The great news is that the techniques that professional traders use eas
ily found and, in fact, if you ask them nicely, they will give you the docu
ments necessary to see behind the scenes in their programs. Then it is a
matter of incorporating what they do right into your retail activity to help
you get to the next level.
Outside Accountability
While professional traders have different motivations, attitudes toward
money, and general psychological makeup from their retail counterparts,
it took an act of Congress to get them there. In 1936 the Commodity Ex
change Act was implemented as a response the U.S. Supreme Court's deci
sion to declare the original Future Trading Act as an unconstitutional use
of the Congress's taxing power. In 1974 the act was amended to create the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), an independent agency
of the U.S. government.
By creating the CFTC Congress effectively replaced the Commodity
Exchange Act. In 1982 the CFTC appointed the National Futures Associa
tion (NFA) as a self-regulatory body that deals with licensing, auditing, and
monitoring CT As and professional traders who exceed various maximum
contract reporting requirements.
Professional Traders are forced to keep their records transparent to
the NFA and the CFTC, both organizations that take their fiduciary respon
sibility very seriously. Various companies that have been shut down for
engaging in unfair practices can be seen every day on the CFTC web site.
Professional traders are not able to set up shop unless they take sev
eral precautionary steps. First they must file disclosure documents. The
disclosure documents are the professional CTAs' way of revealing their
trading secrets, past results, hypothetical results, and responsibilities to
their clients. The disclosure document is the number-one stepping stone
for retail traders to gain insight into how professional traders trade the
markets.
Which markets CT As trade, whether they buy or sell options, if they
have a long or short strategy, the number of contracts traded per particular
cash amounts, monthly and maximum draw, commission fees, along with
the maximum losses that are used to halt trading for a client, are disclosed.
Since the CT A has a legal responsibility to their clients and prospective
clients in following their disclosure documents to the letter, a lot of infor
mation can be revealed.
Retail traders have none of these outside responsibilities. Their suc
cesses, losses, and strategies need not be revealed or monitored by anyone.

==================================================

22 DESIGNING THE TRADE
With zero required accountability, it is no surprise that retail traders fail in
their fiduciary responsibility to themselves. The majority of them lack a
written trading plan and feel that a stop loss is money management and
risk management all wrapped up into one.
Is it any wonder that 92 percent of first-time traders lose all of their
money?
Professional Traders, on the other hand, are constantly being moni
tored by the government, and many of them take the next step and become
monitored by private parties such as Barclays and Autumn Gold. These
sites rank eTAs according to their annual returns. In much the same way
that the scientific community keeps itself honest through peer review, the
private monitoring sites allow other eTAs and potential clients to compare
similar money managers to each other.
You can see how the various eTAs who trade currencies, S&P, and
the like compare against others in their asset class, as well as how they
rank in their overall returns against all eTAs. Those who are doing well
must send you their disclosure document just as readily as the ones who
are not doing well. This type of research becomes invaluable in helping
you determine the realistic returns that you can receive in your trading
program and to discover what professionals are doing it right and which
ones are doing it wrong.
TIGHTENING UP YOUR APPROACH
TO THE MARKETS
When making the transition from operating like a retail trader to operating
like a professional trader, retail traders need to go from being haphazard
in their approach to taking control of their trading destiny. It is easy to
become a trading statistic that falls by the wayside. What isn't easy is de
veloping the necessary winning attitude that will help you make the mental
transition to trading like a pro.
This will require that you step outside yourself and take a critical look
at your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) to your
trading capital. Writing up a formal SWOT analysis as the first step to
developing your trading plan is an empowering act. It has the ability to
clarify your trading thinking and allows you to build on your strengths
and opportunities while minimizing the impact of your weaknesses and
threats.
A proper SWOT analysis will not only help you perfect your approach
to the markets, it is essential for you to establish realistic trading goals.
Trading goals can be established on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis.

From Retail Trader to Professional Trader 23
These goals should encompass not only profit goals, but the number and
amount of draw downs
Forming your own trading club or joining an established trading club
can also help you tighten your approach to the markets. It will help you de
velop accountability while eliminating lonely trader syndrome. This type of
peer review forces you to be honest with yourself and your trading results.
This will make it easier for you to make your transition to a professional
trader.

The one who adapts his policy to the times prospers,
and likewise ... the one whose policy clashes with the
demands of the times does not.
-Niccolo Machiavelli, The Prince
The futures and commodities market was originally established in the
United States in the late 1800s. The original intent was to help smooth
out major price fluctuations that occurred when there were either
shortages or surpluses in the marketplace. At the time, international com
merce on the scale that it has reached in the past two hundred years
was unfathomable. Today, trillions of dollars in raw materials and finished
goods traverse the globe at a frenetic pace.
While the United States was not the first to lead the world in the in
dustrial revolution, it became the key architect in the development of the
world's international commerce that we enjoy today. The United States' in
fluence has brought about a financial model that is being emulated across
the globe. Countries all over, such as the economically motivated European
Union, as well as India and the politically communist but economically cap
italist China, are developing their market economies as quickly as they can.
While these countries are important, they are just the tip of the iceberg in
the number of countries working hard to build up their burgeoning market
economies.
In the wake of this robust global economic growth, the once-humble
beginnings of the U.S. futures and commodities exchanges have taken
on a new role. As raw materials from various countries must compete
against one another, currency rate fluctuations, and the economic reality

26 DESIGNING THE TRADE
of interdependent economic policies, futures and commodity exchanges
have popped up all over the globe. Commodities contracts such as soy
beans, oil, and gold, once dominated by the U.S. exchanges, the Chicago
Board of Trade (CBOT), the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), and
the New York Mercantile Exchange, have found themselves sharing space
and multiple time zones with newly formed exchanges in India, China, and
Dubai.
Where once the U.S. exchanges held a virtual monopoly in offering
commodity and futures exchange contracts, they are now faced with fierce
competition from various exchanges in other countries and the entrance
of new players onto their domestic soil. A5 opposed to being leaders, they
are now pressed into taking a reactionary role. Where once their contracts
set the tone in volume and price discovery, many other similar contracts
are beginning to gain prominence worldwide and are dictating price and
market relevance.
In the midst of all of this is the trader. Whether retail or professional,
the growth of the 24-hour global trading marketplace is playing a signifi
cant role in determining everyone's long-term success. The trader's ability
to adapt to information, both technical and fundamental, as well as his abil
ity to be serviced in multiple marketplaces are becoming more and more
relevant. There is no special secret to trading in this new environment; it
simply becomes more important that you be able to process information,
while at the same time being able to protect yourself from activities occur
ring halfway across the world while you sleep.
In this chapter we explore the recent merger of the CBOT and CME
and what it means to the everyday trader's activities. We also take a look
at the various new exchanges popping up across the United States and
abroad. In addition, we look at the future of single-stock futures (SSFs) in
the United States and their international counterparts, contracts for differ
ence (CFDs), and discover which one is more relevant.
Next, we look at the impact that the over-the-counter (OTC) forex mar
ket has on the exchange-traded currency markets, if any. We also discuss
the revolutionary importance of the Standard Portfolio Analysis of Risk
(SPAN) risk management system and the natural interaction of the spot,
futures, and options markets. We take an honest look at the difficulties
of trading these various markets in real time and in back-testing, both of
which are important in order to develop the necessary tools to succeed.
Finally, we highlight the five key markets that will be used as examples
throughout the book (S&P 500, gold, oil, euro, and com). While these are
not the only markets in the world to trade, many ofthese are traded in mul
tiple arenas and time zones and are affected on a global scale by policies
and regulations that do not originate in the United States.

EXCHANGES
In the spring of 1848, little did the original 83 merchants of the Chicago
Board of Trade know that they would forever change the world. From this
humble beginning the asset class of derivatives has exploded. Nobel Prizes
have been awarded to mathematicians who have come up with formulas
to predict the behavior of option derivatives. Companies have come and
gone, almost taking entire economies with them, trying to beat derivatives.
Countries that once banned commodity trading are now jumping on the
bandwagon. All of this activity has forced commodity exchanges to grow
from trading just agricultural products to trading a wide array of financial,
climate, and currency products that could not even have been imagined
160 years ago.
The success of the derivatives asset class is fueled solely by traders
worldwide wanting to participate in markets that they could not afford
otherwise. The versatility of the commodity exchange model has moved
it so far from its original roots as to almost confuse those who are familiar
with agricultural commodities and stocks into believing that the products
being presented to them are somehow different from what they have been
trading all along. This is not the case.
Since the inception of the forward contract, there have been two mar
kets for it. There have been the standardized contracts, what we know as
futures contracts, and the customized contracts, what we know as over
the-counter (OTC) contracts. Whereas the liquidity of the standardized
contracts has always been guaranteed by the exchanges themselves, the
OTC market was thought to be nearly illiquid because of its customization.
Since two counterparties are agreeing to an arrangement with very specific
criteria, it was thought that it would be difficult to find anyone else who
would be willing to accept the same terms. The OTC markets, realizing the
dilemma, decided to take a page out the commodity exchange handbook
and simply standardize the sizes and increments of their custom contracts.
Consequently, they have added a tremendous amount of volume to their
activities. OTC forex trading is a prime example of that; it currently trades
approximately $2 trillion worth daily, all between counterparties with no
central pricing exchange.
The far-reaching effects of the commodity exchange model have quite
literally changed the world. Largely because of passage of the Commodity
Futures Modernization Act of 2000 (CFMA) , there are exchanges all over
the world that will allow you to trade on various future events, like pres
idential elections, greenhouse gas emissions, and the weather. The Com
modity Futures Modernization Act paved the way for OTC trading of en
ergy credits and electronic energy trading, along with the development

of single-stock futures. There are exchanges that have tapped into these
simple expansions of power in new and amazing ways. They have devel
oped ways to minimize traders' losses by stylizing their product offerings
through so-called binary futures and binary options, along with develop
ing all-electronic trading markets. No matter what the product is or how it
is administered, the same elements always apply: The contracts are lever
aged, the product traded is not the actual product, and the product is pri
marily designed to manage unseen risk.
Exotic Exchanges
The CFMA has led to many exchanges popping up that do not fit the tra
ditional mold. Some are recognized members of a trading exchange, while
others are traded OTC. Whatever the case, they do not fall in line with
what is traditionally traded, yet they have an impact on what occurs in
today's trading environment and may actually be what retail traders have
an opportunity to trade in the future. At one time the OTC forex market
was considered solely the domain of banks and major corporations pro
tecting themselves from import and export risks. Today it is commonly
traded by retail investors and is a major contributor to the U.S. $500 trillion
OTC market.
'rradeSports Ltd.llntrade TradeSports Ltd. was originally founded in
2000 in Dublin, Ireland, as an online web site with the express purpose of
letting speculators choose whether or not future outcomes will come to
pass. Within five years the site had accrued more than 50,000 members and
had monthly trading volume of almost four million trades. In order to make
sure it was not limited to being just a sports betting site, TradeSports sepa
rated its sports-related trading site from its nonsports markets by acquiring
Intrade. The Intrade.com web site offers traders the ability to speculate on
the outcomes of presidential nominations, U.S. recession figures, as well as
the Dow Jones final close for the year. Each position is simple: If you buy
(go long), you think the event will happen; if you sell (go short) you think
the event won't happen. In order to facilitate a better understanding of the
odds, the sites have developed a simple 0 to 100 system, with 0 being 0
percent likelihood of an event occurring and 100 being 100 percent like
lihood of an event occurring. Any figure in between 0 and 100 represents
the market's overall sentiment at that time. When I originally wrote the
manuscript for this book the web site predicted that there was a 72 per
cent likelihood of the United States going into a recession in 2008 and that
Barack Obama had an 82 percent likelihood of winning the Presidential
Election. As we now know, the web site was right in both instances.

While this exchange is exciting, it is an OTC exchange that acts as
the go-between for various counterparties and is not without controversy.
Since the contracts are customized, the wording can be very strict and if
not followed closely you can be left a little confused about whether you
can receive your payout.
Although rare, one contract stands out clearly. In July 2006 North
Korea gave out a press release stating that it could successfully fire ballis
tic missiles outside of its airspace. At the time, Intrade had a contract that
revolved around this potential outcome. Those who had bought a contract
(they believed that the outcome could occur) felt that they should be paid
out. The fine print of this contract, however, stated that two stipulations
had to occur simultaneously: First, North Korea had to be able to fire bal
listic missiles outside of its airspace; and second, this had to be confirmed
by the U.S. Department of Defense. The U.S. Department of Defense never
confirmed the test, which led to the Intrade buyers not being paid out on
their contract purchases.
In 2005 Intrade applied to the Commodity Futures Trading Commis
sion to become a recognized exchange in the United States.
lIedgeStI'eet In 2004 HedgeStreet became the first Internet-based
futures/derivatives exchange. The goal was to provide a forum where spec
ulators and retail investors could protect themselves by hedging against
major economic events and price movements. In an attempt to differenti
ate itselffrom the typical options and futures contracts, HedgeStreet chose
two innovative products, binary options and capped futures. Each product
was chosen for its ability to minimize the losses of the retail traders who
decided to invest in what they called "hedge lets. "
Binary options were not completely new, but HedgeStreet was the first
exchange to build its entire business model around them. Binary options
are simple yes/no contracts, similar to Intrade's wilVwon't setup. You are
paid out only if the final price is above the strike price. You receive a flat
$10 for getting it right and nothing if you get it wrong. The capped futures
have a variable price payout, but it is capped at an upper limit, and losses
are limited to a predetermined floor.
Although both products are exciting, HedgeStreet has had difficulty in
developing volume, liquidity, market makers, and the right set of products
to present to the public. As of this writing, it has been acquired by IG Group,
a major binary option player in the United Kingdom.

to create the only voluntary, legally binding greenhouse gas reduction
exchange in North America.
CCX has developed a market in six greenhouse gas emissions: carbon
dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, sulfur hexafluoride, perfluorocarbons,
and hydrofiuorocarbons. Since its inception in 2003, it has reached two
monumental milestones: First, it has committed its members to reducing
aggregate emissions by 6 percent by 2010; and second, it has accumulated
an aggregate baseline of 226 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equiva
lent (credits), which is equal to the United Kingdom's total allocation.
Like any effective exchange-traded market, CCX has started at the
base-the market makers, those companies that are in need of green
house gas credits, and those capable of qualifying for greenhouse gas
credits-and brought them together. That means that in the not-too-distant
future retail traders will be able to participate in the trading of greenhouse
credits themselves or at the very least some form of derivative of the green
house credit program.
New U.S. Exchanges
The futures and commodities market took 160 years to develop in the
United States. In just the past eight years, since the passing of the CFMA,
the entire culture has been turned on its ear. What were once considered
foregone conclusions about the exchanges- member-owned exchanges,
floor brokers, and open-outcry trading-are quickly becoming a thing of
the past.
In November 2002 the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) became
the first commodities exchange to be listed as a public company. In
much the same way that agricultural commodities account for less than
30 percent of the active contracts traded, electronic trading has begun to
replace open-outcry trading. Floor brokers have had to either adapt to a
changing environment of trading from a screen (as opposed to gaining their
cues from other traders on the floor) or leave the business altogether. In the
midst of all of this change, more and more foreign entities have succeeded
in gaining a foothold in the U.S. commodities exchange markets. This has
led to a pan-global trading environment, the likes of which we had never
seen before.
While some of these exchanges are not 100 percent new, they have
been retooled and revamped in such a way as to be unrecognizable from
the original. Oftentimes they provide the only way that foreign entities can
come into the United States and hope to succeed in developing a relation
ship with the retail market. Make no bones about it: They are changing only
the name, not everything else that has worked for them in the past; elec
tronic platforms, OTC quoting, and access to international markets are just
a few of the things that are here to stay.

u.s. Futures Exchange The U.S. Futures Exchange, LLC, was orig
inally called Eurex US. It was established by Eurex, quite literally the
world's largest derivatives exchange. In 2006 alone Eurex executed more
than 1.5 billion contracts. It has established trading and clearing relation
ships all throughout Europe and Asia. What has made the exchange so
powerful over the years is its ability to deliver trading and clearing fully
electronically. As a pioneer in the electronic arena, Eurex felt that it could
easily expand its global reach into the United States. After only a few years
in the U.S. market, Eurex sold 70 percent of its stake to the Man Group.
The two have teamed up to make a second go of the U.S. market, utilizing
Man's extensive U.S. introducing broker (IE) and retail network.
ICE Futures U.S. (ICE/NYBOT) The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)
is a direct product of the CFMA. Founded in 2000, the exchange's origi
nal intent was to provide an around-the-clock transparent OTC derivatives
energy exchange. It quickly outpaced its competitors and expanded into
the futures business through the acquisition of the International Petroleum
Exchange. With the development of its electronic platform, ICE has suc
ceeded in moving its entire energy futures contracts electronically. Con
tinuing its progressive move forward, in 2007 ICE acquired the New York
Board of Trade (NYBOT).
Before 1998 the New York Board of Trade didn't even exist. Just like
ICE, it is an amalgamation of multiple exchanges that have merged over
the years. A combination of the Coffee, Sugar, & Cocoa Exchange, Inc.,
founded in 1882, and the New York Cotton Exchange, founded in 1870,
NYBOT became the premier exchange for the soft commodities in the
United States. While the currently retooled NYBOT still maintains an open
outcry pit concurrently with the new electronic offerings, ICE's drive to
make its energy contracts fully electronic will most likely be repeated.
ICE's experience in international markets located in the United
Kingdom and Canada as well as its OTC business provides an unparalleled
level of access and a robust amount of information for U.S.-based traders.
As traders begin to understand the quotes and utilize the platform, they
will see opportunities for arbitrage and an unparalleled level of service that
didn't exist in the old limited open-outcry format.

CME Group: The Last U.S. Exchange?
The competition worldwide is getting cutthroat. In order to have any
chance at competing in this global environment, U.S. exchanges have had
to look toward consolidation in order to survive the monolithic power of
mergers like the NYSE Euronext and the aggressive move by Eurex to enter
the U.S. market. While this activity looks exciting on the surface, the move
of the big fish to eat the little fish leads to many casualties. The floor bro
kers and traders are clearly seen as being impacted by these consolidation
moves, which are driving the markets to become electronically traded, but
all of the support staff is being adversely affected as well, many of whom
have been doing their jobs for years with little prospect of being properly
retooled and retrained at this point.
The most high-profile merger of commodities exchanges has been the
CME and CBOT merger. This merger has brought together under one roof
the United States' two oldest exchanges. The combined power of these
two exchanges will allow the CME Group to compete in today's new en
vironment. It will be able to reduce costs, transition to electronic trading,
and use the might of the merged exchanges' combined capital to acquire
competitors, like NYMEX, and to increase its ownership position in joint
venture partners, like the Singapore Exchange (SGX).
From humble beginnings, the CME and the CBOT not only have made
themselves relevant for the twenty-first century, but they also are consid
ered serious players. Smaller exchanges, such as the Kansas City Board of
Trade and the Minneapolis Grain Exchange, will find it difficult to continue
their exchange life quietly and without disruption. There is no doubt that
in the near future they will be absorbed in some form or fashion in order
to stay competitive.
Critical Worldwide Commodity Exchanges
At an unprecedented speed since the 1990s, futures exchanges have been
popping up around the world in the most unlikely places. From China and
India, both countries that banned futures in the 1950s, to places like Dubai,
futures exchanges are exploding. This worldwide growth in the develop
ment of the commodities markets has been a major contributing factor to
the global renaissance in commodity prices. As countries allover the world

in the value of goods around the world quickly begin to dissipate. Large
profit margins, which were once the domain of aggressive importers and
exporters willing to traverse the world to find bargains, are becoming more
difficult to find as electronic markets are linked up around the world.
China In China there are two prominent commodity exchanges. There
is the Dalian Commodity Exchange and the Shanghai Futures Exchange.
They each comprise 50 percent ofthe Chinese marketplace in terms of dol
lar volumes in trading. In the Dalian exchange alone the total trading vol
ume for 2007 reached U.S. $1.67 trillion. The Futures Industry Association
recently reported that the Dalian exchange has been the dominant futures
exchange for the past eight years. With only 110,000 investors in a nation of
1 billion people and a growing middle class, the Dalian exchange is poised
to be the largest exchange in the world. Currently, the exchange has been
limited to trading soybeans, soy meal, soy oil, corn, palm oil, and linear
low-density polyethene. These limits have been put in place by the Chinese
government in large part to control the rampant fraud and unscrupulous
behavior that existed in the early years of the reintroduction of commodity
trading in China. The Dahan Commodity Exchange has stated on its web
site that it intends to release a hog/pork belly futures contract, a coal fu
tures contract, and a commodity index futures contract within 2008. The
Dalian exchange also plans to launch options on its actively traded soy
bean and corn futures contracts.
Dubai The only question is "What took them so long?" Dubai, one of the
jewel cities of the United Arab Emirates, has finally established its own
gold, commodities, and energy exchanges. With only 6 percent of its rev
enue generated from oil, Dubai has a long history of encouraging free trade
in the region. With multiple free trade zones in media, technology, and
manufacturing, Dubai is one of the most ethnically diverse and business
friendly cities in the world. Established in 2005, the Dubai Gold and Com
modities Exchange is fast becoming one of the region's most important
exchanges. Located right in the middle between Europe and the East, this
exchange helps provide for the continuous trading that a 24-hour market
place needs in order to thrive. As of this writing, the market trades in gold,
silver, euro, British pound, Japanese yen, Indian rupee, and fuel oil futures.
The exchange is expected to develop product offerings in steel, jet fuel,
and cotton.
A second exchange, the Dubai Mercantile Exchange, is set to be the
first energy exchange of the Middle East. Created as a joint venture of
Tatweer, NYMEX, and the Oman Investment Fund, it is poised to be an
international competitive powerhouse for the region.

34 DESIGNING THE TRADE
India The Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) is extending its footprint
across the globe. While operating an exchange in India, it is also a sig
nificant partner of the Dubai Gold and Commodities Exchange. Based in
Mumbai, the exchange has taken a policy of working with both the spot
and futures markets in key agricultural products. This has led it to retaining
72 percent of India's market share. With India being the number one im
porter of gold worldwide and currently importing over 3,000 tons of silver
annually, it is not surprising that MCX ranks number one and number three
in silver and gold futures trading. Couple that with India's consumption of
2.4 million barrels of oil a day (according to www.cia.gov), and it is no won
der that MCX is number two in the world for natural gas futures contracts
and number three for crude oil futures.
Brazil The Brazilian Mercantile and Futures Exchange (BM&F) is the
fourth largest exchange in the world, according to the Futures Industry
Association. It is also the number one exchange of Latin America. With
an average daily volume of 1 million contracts and its recent partnership
agreement with the CME Group, the exchange is poised to playa significant
role in all of North America. Without a doubt it is a major player in the fu
tures market, providing futures contracts on gold, feeder cattle, live cattle,
arabic a coffee, robusta coffee, cotton, crystal sugar, com, and soybeans.
WHAT DOES TIllS ltlEAN
FOR THE MARIiET?
With the constant merger of exchanges from around the world, new and
more interesting products are constantly being created. There is a greater
effect of settling commodity prices in China or Brazil and how they impact
the opening of commodity prices in India or the United States. The rules
and regulations for stocks, commodities, and indexes quickly become the
concern of an international marketplace.
Various forms of trading and contract types that are considered over
the-counter in one country, that may be illegal in another, and that may be
caught in limbo in yet another country are still owned by the same cor
poration. This brave new trading environment leads both to a world of
opportunity and to a world of land mines and problems, both legally and
logistically.
As the CME Group aggressively begins to flex its financial muscle
in the acquisition arena, industry operators become increasingly skepti
cal and worried about the implications of a monolithic, all-encompassing
exchange. The CME Group, NYSE Euronext, the U.S. Futures Exchange

(formerly Eurex US), and ICE face a multitude of hurdles in offering their
exchange and clearing services. Banks and industry experts are wising up
to the consolidation efforts. They are beginning to see that the concentra
tion of both clearing and exchange services may lead to higher pricing for
them in the long run.
Where once before traders could rely on competition to minimize their
transactional costs, it has become apparent that when one group owns
10 percent in one exchange, owns 35 percent of another exchange, and is
about to acquire another, the competition that allowed them to search for
the best price possible is slowly evaporating. Add to the simmering rebel
lion from the banking and brokerage community the fact that many ofthese
acquisitions involve exchanges that were once involved exclusively in
either stocks or futures, but rarely both, a recipe for disaster is on the hori
zon. So while the push to merge and develop one worldwide electronic ex
change is an inevitable conclusion to all of this activity, the regulators are
light-years behind in how best to operate in this cross-border community.
New products are constantly being developed all across the globe, and
either various rules and regulations will have to be adjusted to accommo
date them or a whole generation of regulators will need to be retrained in
their auditing duties. Cash markets all around the world are being affected
by stock and commodity exchanges in far-fiung regions simultaneously us
ing price discovery to determine the true value of various underlying as
sets. In this environment, a growing schism of what activity is acceptable
or not acceptable and what regulator or regulators have jurisdiction over
what is happening is on the horizon.
A prime example of this regulatory schism is the contracts for differ
ence (CFDs) and the single-stock futures (SSFs) fiasco that occurred in
the United States. An antiquated law, the Shad-Johnson Accord, separated
the joint efforts of the stock and futures markets for almost two decades.
By the time the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 had kicked
in to allow SSF trading, the rest of the world had already passed it by.
Currently South Africa hosts the world's largest SSF exchange at 700,000
contracts daily, which dwarfs the 26,000 contracts traded by the last SSF
exchange in the United States, OneChicago.
In contrast, CFDs are experiencing tremendous growth. They are uti
lized in at least 12 different countries, with more countries joining daily.
Unfortunately, since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission main
tains strict regulations on OTC trading of financial instruments, the prod
ucts cannot be offered in the United States, although traders outside the
country can purchase CFDs of U.S. companies and indexes. How U.S. reg
ulators will react to the pan-global commodity exchanges that will want
to increase revenues by offering CFDs to their customer base is unknown,
but the question will arise a lot sooner than later.

36 DESIGNING THE TRADE
Contracts for Difference (CFDs)
Contracts for difference (CFDs) grew out of the unique tax regulatory en
vironment of the United Kingdom. They were developed as a way to avoid
unnecessary taxes for companies or money managers that wanted to hedge
against the risk in their portfolios. Soon after their creation they jumped
over to the retail sector like wildfire. The elegance of the concept has
driven its acceptance across the globe and has paved the way for a simple
solution for traders to participate in shares, currencies, and commodities
anywhere in the world.
Known by its other name, leveraged share trading, CFDs allow the cre
ation of a contract between two private parties. The buyer and seller simply
agree to pay each other the difference between the current value of an asset
and its value at contract time. With this simple contract any investor can
speculate on the price of stock shares, commodity prices, or index values
without being required to actually purchase the underlying item.
There are three core benefits to end users: First, they can go long or
short with few, if any, restrictions; second, they can own a contract that
may never expire, unlike futures and options; and finally, they can choose
the amount of leverage that they want to have, putting up anywhere from
1 percent to 30 percent of the contract value, depending on the agreed
upon contract or counterparty. This without question is the fastest-growing
financial sector. It will quickly dwarf the amount of retail activity that the
forex OTC market is currently enjoying.
CFDs are superior to options because there are no "greeks" (beta,
delta, etc.) to contend with. CFDs follow the underlying shares one for one
with few modifications. There are no long, complex formulas that have to
be calculated in order to determine the true value of the CFD or the effects
that volatility is currently having on the CFD.
Not only being superior to options, CFDs also beat out SSFs in both
liquidity and flexibility. SSFs require that you buy a set number of shares,
100, typically at a fixed rate of 20 percent of the contract value and at an
inflated price to the underlying share because of various interest rate costs,
but with no ability to share in the dividend payout of the stock itself.
All is not roses with CFDs, though. Much like any OTC market, forex
trading being a prime example, the broker is the market maker. How he
makes his money is through a commission or a spread between the buy
and sell price and interest rate charges for carrying a position overnight.
This spread can run from a fraction of a percentage point to a flat fee.
Whatever the case, associated costs have the ability to become expensive
if not watched carefully. There is also the danger that, since the CFDs are
traded with little or no regulatory oversight, the assumed liquidity for your
position can evaporate overnight. The problems don't end there. CFDs are

==================================================

Markets and Margin 37
nonnegotiable contracts. Whichever broker you established the CFD con
tract with is where your CFD has to stay. Regardless of whether the CFD
price spread is tighter somewhere else, you must maintain your position.
While these potential issues with CFDs are real, there is no precedence
of brokers abusing the system. Yet for those who have been afraid to ven
ture into the world of CFD trading, there has been an even bigger move to
legitimize the product. With the recent merger of the Sydney Futures Ex
change and the Australian Stock Exchange, there is a proposed expansion
of their exchange-traded CFDs to include stocks from around the world.
If this occurs, they will be the only exchange-traded CFDs in the world,
eliminating many of the problems that OTC CFDs incur. Currently the
Australian Stock Exchange has an online simulator to help traders learn
about CFDs without having to risk their capital or run afoul of their local
regulations.
The backbone of the futures and options industry revolves around the
ability to offer leverage through margin. In trying to do that effectively,
exchanges have been hamstrung by the requirement that the contracts that
they have to offer must expire at various intervals (monthly, quarterly etc.).
If the CFD makes the leap from stocks to other spot markets, without the
problem of having a forced expiration date, what is the true relevance of
the futures market and how do CFDs affect the relationship that all of these
markets have with options? These are questions that the exchanges, regu
lators, and shareholders will have to answer.
With that being the case, speculators-longs (buyers) and shorts
(sellers) -must put up the exact same amount of margin. When the market
goes against the speculator, money is transferred directly from the longs
to the shorts during a bear market, and the shorts directly transfer funds
to the longs during a bull market. Therefore a margin call is of great im
portance and if it is not met within the allotted time your position can be
liquidated without notice. If the forced liquidation results in losses that ex
ceed the margin amount, the speculator is held liable.
DAISY CHAIN El"FECT
It is important to note that every actively traded market discussed in this
book was designed to do one thing and one thing only: operate as insur
ance for the cash market. The OTC market was developed as a way to
customize the protection of commodities, currencies, and shares. Futures
were developed to protect farmers against wild fluctuations in supply and
demand, along with many other cash markets. Options evolved to protect
shares and futures contracts. No matter what the underlying cash market

==================================================

38 DESIGNING THE TRADE
is, whether commodities or equities, every derivative that has grown out of
it was originally intended to manage risk or operate as a hedge.
The fact that in order for any of them to work you need liquidity and
speculators is the nature of the beast. Based on the level a speculator can
afford, there are many places where he can interact, head to head, with the
people who ultimately buy and sell the actual cash positions. If a trader has
enough capital, he can operate directly in the cash market. However, the
OTe market is the closest the majority of traders will come to trading the
cash market. The futures market runs third in the daisy chain, and finally
you have the options market.
A multitude of different types of contracts are traded in each of these
arenas, many of them so complex as to need a PhD in mathematics to un
derstand them, let alone trade them. How these markets interact with one
another is based on an amazing dance of credit, faith, history, technology,
and rules-each one depending on the other to manage risk and diminish
loss, while at the same time making the credit easier along the way so they
can expand the number of market participants (speculators).
Cash
Without the cash market, none of the others would exist. Or at least the
cash market would like to believe so. The majority of traders experience
the cash market in only a few arenas-stocks, precious metals, and cur
rencies. At one time or another on a small to moderate scale they may de
cide to get involved with any of the three markets out of necessity. Either
they are participating in a retirement plan of some sort, or they visit a gold
dealer, or they travel overseas. Whatever the case, they then experience
the rules of the cash market firsthand.
The cash market is straightforward. When you decide to purchase a
share of stock for $1, you receive ownership of a share of stock for $l.
The same can be said for investors who are familiar with spot transactions
in gold and silver, whether they purchase a few precious metal coins or
own several ounces of gold and silver bars. Investment in precious met
als is an all-or-nothing deal. Investors who travel may have to exchange
one currency for another. Rarely do individual investors purchase cattle,
soybeans, or all the companies in an index.
Those who have ever had a cash transaction have experienced one of
the most frustrating experiences possible, the spread. Whether it is shares
in a company, gold bars, or a foreign currency, the difference between the
price you pay and the price at which the seller is willing to buy it back
from you are often nowhere near each other. This spread, in addition to
whatever other built-in markups there are, is how the cash market makers
tum a profit.

==================================================

Markets and Margin 39
This is the danger zone. No one wants to lose their hard-earned capital.
So in order to be able to speculate in the cash market but still have an
out, the over-the-counter market was developed. Whatever position can be
taken in the cash market can be offset or protected in the over-the-counter
market for a fraction of the cost.
Over-the-Counter (OTC)
Currently the most popular OTC market in the world is foreign exchange
(forex) trading. Trading upwards of $2 trillion a day (hard figures are dif
ficult to come by since there is no central exchange), banks and retail in
vestors rub shoulders in attempting to figure out what the true value of a
country is. In the OTC forex market the rules are fairly simple. Two coun
terparties agree to cross buy and sell particular lots of foreign currencies
that must be bought or sold back within a given time. This typically can oc
cur anytime within a 24-hour period. If a position is carried overnight, then
interest rate charges may accrue. Contracts for difference (CFDs) operate
on the exact same principles as the OTC forex market.
Just like the cash transactions, the difference between the bid and the
ask provides a profit spread that the brokerage or bank uses to make its
money. In return for the opportunity to earn your business, the broker
age or bank will extend you credit (i.e., margin) to buy and sell currencies
throughout the day. While possible, rarely do retail investors choose to put
up the face value of a currency contract. They will typically take advantage
of the leverage provided in order to increase the returns on their dollars.
For those companies or institutional investors actually holding on to
cash positions in stocks or foreign currencies, the leverage of forex and
CFDs gives them an inexpensive way to put on a countertrade just in case
they have misinterpreted the market's direction.
Futures
The futures market is the OTC market without the need for blind trust.
Grown from the world of the OTC forward contract, the futures market
provides several key services. The primary service is the centralizing of in
formation. In the OTC market, every bank or brokerage offering contracts
is able to set its own spreads and slightly different pricing. In order to get
the best bid/ask spread or to discover the best pricing, a consumer (retail
or institutional) had to call around. With the prevalence of the Internet, it
is an easier task, but it still requires research on the part of the consumer
to find the best deals.
The by-product of the centralizing of information is the transparency
in pricing and information. Anyone in the world can receive quotes from

DESIGNING THE TRADE
the exchange and receive the exact same price. Anyone can look at the
Commitments of Traders reports and see exactly who is buying and selling
what markets and the ebb and flow from the longs to the shorts and vice
versa. Another key benefit of the exchanges is that there is no overt bid/ask
spread. You have a likely chance to buy or sell at any quote on the screen if
you are willing to put in a special order request, such as limits or stop limits.
Finally, unlike the OTC market, you are able to hold on to your con
tracts for longer time frames, there are no interest rate charges for using
margin or carrying contracts overnight, and your liquidity is not solely de
pendent on just the bank or the brokerage- you have the world.
For those who hold significant cash or OTC positions, the ease of get
ting in and out of futures contracts and the ability to use margined con
tracts to do so are attractive prospects when you want to manage your risk.
Options
The last instrument on this daisy chain is the option. There is a reason why
the fee you pay for an option is called a premium and fee you pay for an
insurance policy is called a premium. While the financial party line talks
about options in terms of the "right" versus the "obligation" to own the
underlying asset, the reality is quite simple. Options are an inexpensive in
surance for the cash, OTC, and futures markets. Whether they are stock
options, futures options, or currency options, they all operate with the ex
act same principles.
For a small fee (a premium), you can purchase an option (put or call)
at a specific price, typically the same price at which you got into one of
your other positions, and for a set amount of time. The fact that you can
purchase options in-, at-, or out-of-the-money is a testament to their ability
to help you protect against risk.
Credit (Margin)
What makes this entire system of cash-OTC-futures-options work is the
ever-increasing amount of credit that you receive as you work your way
through the chain. Let's look at the stock market as a prime example:
$100 in shares (cash) is the same as
$30 in CFDs (OTC)
$20 in SSFs (futures)
$5 in calls (options)
$5 in puts ( options)



==================================================
                     PAGE 55                      
==================================================

Markets and Margin 41
The same $100 in shares is supported by at least four other products.
(There are many more products such as swaps, warrants, and convertibles
that are not appropriate for this book, but also extend the credit.) This has
created an additional $400 in credit for just $60 in up-front cash. That is
almost a sevenfold increase in purchasing power.
On the face of it, economists and major investors like Warren Buffett
are consistently worried that this pyramid of easy credit will cause the col
lapse of our civilization as we know it. If done properly, the interrelation
ship between each of these markets was designed to make it less risky, not
more risky. The worry may be unnecessary. It's like saying that if too many
people buy car insurance, whether they drive a car or not, it will destroy
the car industry. One need not be in direct correlation with the other.
Whatever the case may be, the current system has a built-in checks and
balances. There is a requirement that the options be purchased outright,
since they are the least expensive, and that when margin is extended it
comes in two forms. In the first stage you are extended what is known as
an initial margin. This is a percentage of the contract that brokerage or the
exchange has deemed to be appropriate for the market's current volatility
levels.
In the second stage of a margin offering is the maintenance margin.
The maintenance margin is the absolute minimum amount that trader must
keep in his account in order to maintain his position. If the trader can
not keep his account at the maintenance level, then he must put up more
money to get back to the initial margin or close his position out. This is
known as a margin call.
While the system is far from perfect, it works. If not for the fraud com
ponent, major disasters at Societe General and Barings Bank could have
been avoided solely based on the various margin calls the traders were re
ceiving on the way down.
Standard Portfolio Analysis of Risk (SPAN)
Whether by design or by chance, in 1988 the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
created one of most sophisticated systems for margin calculation around.
In light of the fact that the CME is expanding at a rapid rate and acquiring
both international and domestic products as part of its stable, the SPAN
system will allow the CME to assess account risk in an ever-expanding way.
As excerpted directly from the CME Group web site:
SPAN uses the risk arrays to scan underlying market price changes
and volatility changes for all contracts in a portjolio, in order to
determine value gains and losses at the portjolio level. This is the
single most important calculation executed by the program.



==================================================
                     PAGE 56                      
==================================================

42 DESIGNING THE TRADE
Through its sophisticated calculations the SPAN program takes into
account the delta of options, intercommodity spread credits, as well as the
amount of volatility affecting the overall account. Based on this calcula
tion, something interesting happens, not just for the exchange, but for the
trader as well. When a trader has properly daisy-chained his cash, OTC, fu
tures, and options holdings, margins have a way of almost magically being
reduced.
The exchange realizes that the OTC, futures, and options markets were
designed as insurance vehicles for the cash market. Through the SPAN sys
tem, traders are rewarded for being aware of this. By strategically manag
ing your positions into a way where they are protecting one another and re
ducing your overall volatility, you can easily find your margin requirements
being cut by half or more. Although the CME invented the SPAN margin
calculation system, various exchanges around the world have adopted it.
GLOBAL MARKETS
There are so many markets, exchanges, and contracts that you can trade.
It becomes an overwhelming task to pick and choose just the right markets
and just the right exchanges to interact with. At the same time, the various
markets fall into several broad categories: stocks, indexes, interest rates,
currencies, agriculture, softs, precious metals, industrial metals, energy,
and meats. There are also several exotic categories such as the climate and
oils. In this book the goal is to narrow down the universe of markets and
to make examples of just a handful. The markets that are represented are
meant both to be broad strokes of a category and to reflect the interrela
tionship that this market has with various other factors in the economy.
By no means is this done to suggest that you trade these markets ex
clusively or to teach you to trade these markets to riches. They are meant
as examples to assist you in selecting your markets to trade. My book Win
ning the Trading Game (John Wiley & Sons, 2008) outlines how to select
markets for your own risk, reward, and volatility levels. Reading that book
will do a better job of helping you determine what is right for you instead
of blindly following the markets that are outlined in this chapter. The goal
here is to see you become a trader who can nimbly look at a market and
construct a trading approach around it, regardless of what it is.
That being said, five markets were chosen for their robustness, current
international importance, and the fact that they are traded across multiple
contract types. While not the only markets to meet these criteria, they are
the easiest to recognize among a slew of other contracts. The examples in

the book revolve around the S&P 500, gold, crude oil, euro, and com. Many
other contracts are also relevant in today's trading environment, including
U.S. Treasury bonds, the CAC 40, DAX, soybeans, Japanese yen, silver, and
the eurodollar.
The funny thing about trading is that you do not need to be in a market
to benefit from the correlative effects of that market's activity. For exam
ple, when you short the euro in futures, you are essentially buying the dol
lar as well; therefore, you do not need to be also be short the yen, for you
would be exposing yourself to the same long dollar risk. If you are buying
gold, you do not need to also buy silver and double expose yourself to a
precious metal long side bias. Or if you are long com, it is rare that you
need to also participate in all of the grain complexes, wheat-soybean. As
always, choose the markets you are most comfortable with.
S&P 500
The S&P 500 is one of the most widely tracked indexes. It contains stocks
of 500 large-cap corporations. It is a mixture of stocks that trade on the
NYSE Euronext and NASDAQ. The success of the S&P 500's ability to
gauge the U.S. economy is rivaled only by the Dow Jones Industrial Aver
age. Over 20 years ago the CME launched the first-ever stock-index futures
on the S&P 500.
The S&P 500 futures contract was meant to fill a need for money man
agers and investors with large stock portfolios seeking to minimize their
exposure to risk. In 1998 a smaller version of the S&P 500 futures contract
was introduced, the Emini S&P 500. One-fifth ofthe size of the full-size S&P
500 futures contract, the Emini has gained in volume and liquidity over the
years. In fact, it is the preferred contract of many institutional traders be
cause of its electronic execution. As of this writing the notional daily value
of the traded Emini S&P 500 is over $140 billion. This is a gross exaggera
tion of the value of the actual shares traded on a daily basis.
The S&P 500 futures contract plays a significant role in determining the
opening of price of the actual index on the NYSE. This is due in large part
to the fact that the Emini S&P 500 futures contract trades 23.5 hours per
day five days a week.
Gold
Metals come in two general categories, precious and nonprecious. The
precious metals are gold, silver, platinum, and palladium. They tend to
be prized for their jewelry qualities even though they also have industrial
and financial applications as well. The two precious metals that sit at the
forefront of all precious metals trading are gold and silver. From India to

44 DESIGNING THE TRADE
New York, gold's long precious metals history has given it a seat on several
commodities exchanges and has helped it to develop a robust OTC market
in the past decade.
With the average mining expense of gold at $238 per ounce, it is a won
der that the price of gold stagnated in the $300 per ounce range for almost
a decade. Couple the high cost of mining with the limited supply of gold
worldwide, and gold has the potential to continue on a significant bull run.
As of this writing the price of gold has exceeded $950 per ounce. The last
previous time it exceeded $800 was January 21, 1980; adjusted for inflation
that would be approximately $2,398.21.
Crude Oil
The finding and drilling of oil has changed the world as we know it for
the past 100 years. Crude oil's impact on the environment, on economies
around the world, and on substitute goods will continue to affect the world
for another century to come. Energy trading became a significant part of
futures in 1978. Energy futures and OTC contracts cover a wide array of
energy products from crude oil to electricity, with crude oil leading the
pack. OTC energy trading can be directly attributed to the Commodities
Futures Modernization Act of 2000. With the liberalization of the futures
rules, energy contracts have become quite popular to trade.
The crude oil market has three large players: Saudi Arabia, Russia, and
the United States. With over five thousand varieties of crude oil available, it
is no surprise that OTC oil futures have played a significant role in reshap
ing the commodities landscape. The most commonly sought-after crude oil,
sweet crude, is also becoming the most difficult to come by. Couple that
with limited access to the most touted crude oil alternative, natural gas,
and we have an energy market that will be overheated for years to come.
Euro
The OTC foreign exchange market is a several trillion dollars a day indus
try. Quite literally, more money is moved daily in the forex market than
in the U.S. equity market and all of the futures exchanges combined. This
market is raw capitalism at work. With a six-day, 24-hour time schedule,
it is one of the most exciting places around to put your money, retail or
institutional.
Fueling a significant portion of this growth has been the creation of
one of the most important currencies in the twenty-first century, the euro.
Consolidating the economies of the 15 countries that are members of the
European Union, the euro was launched in January 2002. Affecting the lives

Corn
Com is one of the most versatile commodities in the world. Whether used
for livestock feed or whiskey, sweetener or fuel, com is a staple in the
lives of people around the globe. With over 600 million metric tons being
produced worldwide, it is a valuable part of the economy in a number of
countries. The United States alone accounted for 280 million metric tons.
Couple the agricultural uses of com with its potential to be used as a fuel
additive or fuel alternative to gas, and com production may be seen as be
ing more in its infant stage. With China currently producing only 131 million
metric tons and Brazil at 35 million metric tons, these two countries alone
have the ability to expand their com production, particularly to meet de
mands of the burgeoning economies.
BECOMING A SOPHISTICATED TRADER
True progress quietly and persistently moves along without notice.
-St. Francis of Assisi (Founder of the Franciscan order, 1181-1226)
The world is changing right before our eyes. The roles of the ex
changes, speculators, hedgers, regulators, and products are being affected
by a global need to connect. What was once a cloistered club centered in
a few select regions has expanded in both amazing and frightening ways.
While the United States' prominence as a world power is slowly being eco
nomically diffused, it also opens the doors for a new form of economic
prosperity.
Part of the success of the retail trader, going into the twenty-first cen
tury, is his willingness to evolve not only his approach but his mind-set to
what trading is really all about. The trading isolationism to which he has
subjected himself is not being mirrored by his professional counterparts.
In fact quite the opposite is occurring; a spirit of cooperation in the shared
end goal of making money is at the forefront of the professional trader's
mind. Your success as a trader will come from your ability to adopt this
exact same frame of mind.
The other part of your success as a retail trader will come from sheer
luck. The first-century philosopher Seneca came up with the quote, "Luck
is what happens when preparation meets opportunity." The opportunities

are abundant; what will make all the difference is how you prepare yourself
today for the trading world of tomorrow.
WHAT DO THESE CHANGES ltlEAN
FOR YOUR TRADING?
Why does the consolidation of exchanges in the United States, increased
activity in exchange trading around the world, new and exotic trading prod
ucts being invented, and the daisy chain of the various markets that can be
traded matter to you, the retail trader? The level of sophistication of your
trading needs to transcend the basic goal of just making money. With new
and better opportunities, the primary requirement that traders will need is
the ability to protect themselves from loss. By focusing on loss protection
as your first order of business, you move yourself from the arena of trading
dabbler to trading professional.
In much the same way your professional counterparts attempt to max
in1ize their risk management, so will you. It is the badge of the professional
to be able to practice or demo trade or back-test trading ideas with the end
goal of showing how well he manages risk in addition to returns. A pro
fessional trader who has 40 to 50 percent returns but also has a maximum
drawdown of 50 percent is far less desirable than a professional trader who
shows 20 to 30 percent returns with a maximum drawdown of 5 percent.
Why would you expect anything less from yourself?
By knowing all of the tools at your disposal-cash, OTC, futures, and
options-and how they dovetail with one another, you begin to improve
your odds of success, solely by diminishing your odds of defeat. This can
be done in your own demo trading or with skilled back-testing on the right
trading platform. However you do it, the goal is to now think outside of
the rigid box of short-term profits and look for an overall healthy way to
preserve your capital while you pursue the best opportunity possible, no
matter what it is or where it is traded.

Some Essentials
of Trading
The secret to trading is often thought to be more a function of time
frame than a function of skill. In much the same way that university
students and alumni promote and defend their alma mater, come hell
or high water, so do proponents of the different schools of trading. With
almost fanatical zeal, traders will tout the benefits of being a day, position,
or swing trader.
One trader will say going home flat is the only way to trade; another
trader will say that the trend is your friend. Who's to say either is 100 per
cent right? As with many things in life, success in trading is not cut and dry.
If it were, everyone who attends a trading seminar or reads a trading book
would be able to emulate the success of the speaker or author immediately.
Each trader has to find his own path to success, using the information that
he acquires along the way as a guide post towards his end goal.
George Soros, Warren Buffett, and Richard Dennis are each success
ful in their own right. George Soros founded the Quantum Fund with the
express purpose of speculating. Much of his trading revolved around short
tern1 and opportunistic currency moves, long before he established his
non-profit company. Warren Buffett took a different approach. Known as a
value investor, Warren Buffett's buy and hold strategy turned many of his
shareholders into multi-millionaires. Richard Dennis, on the other hand,
used commodity options as a way to trade himself to wealth.
All of these men are considered professional traders, yet each has his
own way of doing things, his own strategy for protecting himself from
loss, and his own variety of success in trading the markets. It's a lot like
professional sports. In professional sports there are no two players that

are just alike. You can point to two athletes in the same sport, with simi
lar size, strength, speed, training, and ability. While both are professional
athletes and can become hall-of-famers, it could be for entirely different
reasons.
This chapter is the most important chapter in the book. It lays the foun
dation with your choice of approach to the market and utilization of the
various strategies presented. Overall, it will help clarify how you operate
in the markets. You may discover that you operate just like a professional
trader or, that you have a long way to go. It also sets up how your attitude
toward trading.
We explore the three common types of traders-day, swing, and posi
tion traders-and delineate the advantages and disadvantages of each. We
then look at whether or not being a trader focused solely on time is a re
alistic option when attempting to mimic a professional trader interacting
with the markets. -
We spotlight the necessary components found in a successfully de
signed trade: entry, loss target, and profit target numbers. Following, we
look at the daisy chain interaction of the cash, futures, and options mar
kets. This sheds light on why the strategies work.
Finally, we look at the essential trade setups of trends and counter
trends and explore them in depth. We show how each type of trader can
benefit from them, as dependent on their end goals.
Many of the topics that are touched on in this chapter are explained
more fully in my earlier book, Winning the Trading Game. Nevertheless,
it is not essential to have read it in order to understand the concepts pre
sented here. The strategies and ideas that we cover can be incorporated
into any trading system or program. By identifying the key components, as
presented in this chapter, and utilizing your own system or approach to the
market, you benefit from the inforn1ation.
THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF TRADERS
Being called a day trader, swing trader, or position trader is both a badge of
honor and a title. The majority of traders entering the field come through
one of these gateways. Depending on the book they've read or the guru
they're following at the time, a trader can feel a sense of belonging.
The problem with being a "time frame specialist" is that it holds you
back. While any time frarne may earn you money, there are times when the
market dictates which time frame is better. By not listening to the market
and insisting instead on trading a specific time frame, you lose opportuni
ties for profits and limit your success.



==================================================
                     PAGE 63                      
==================================================

Some Essentials of Trading 49
The market is the great dictator of time frame decisions. To ignore the
market's rhythms is to make it difficult to let your profits ride and cut your
losses as necessary. Being a time frame specialist can limit your chances
to manage your losses. Various loss strategies that apply to one time frame
can apply to another time frame, if the trader is willing to look beyond his
horizon.
That being said, there are three traditional time frame categories that
most traders fall into: day, swing, and position. No time frame is superior to
another. They each have their own pros and cons. The secret to being a pro
in successful trading is to move from one time frame to another seamlessly
(if it makes sense), and knowing when it makes sense to do so.
Day Trader
Investopedia defines day trader as "A stock trader who holds positions for
a very short time (from minutes to hours) and makes numerous trades each
day. Most trades are entered and closed out within the same day."
The name could be day trader, scalper, or active trader, but the process
is the same. You execute trades intraday in order to achieve your profit
goals, with the express purpose of being fiat in your trading at the end of
the day.
Whether you are attempting to earn a few hundred dollars or even
thousands, the practice is to take many small chances throughout the day
without risking all your capital. By minimizing how much you are trying
for, whether it's a few points on the Emini S&P or a couple hundredths of a
cent in currency trading, the belief is that you are risking less and therefore
will have much greater longevity than the swing or position traders.
On the surface, this logic is sound. Problems arise when the market
significantly moves against you when you least expect it, or when slippage
occurs, or when there is a spread involved in the quoted bid ask price. Any
of these three situations can diminish how much you are able to make and
at the same time how much you are losing.
Couple this with a trader's need to be right about the markets-as op
posed to being profitable-and you run into what could be characterized
as slow death. Every day the trader is gaining a little, but losing more. As
time goes on he finds his account value slowly eroding, until eventually he
either has no more trading capital or he can't make any headway.
In the end the demise of the day trader comes about because of two
things: time and commissions. Since day trading is supposed to save you
money with a diminished time frame, it inversely requires more of your
time to monitor, prepare, and participate. For those who simply want to
make a little extra money or for those who are looking to supplement their
retirement, the commitment can easily far exceed the rewards. Spending

==================================================

50 DESIGNING THE TRADE
10 to 12 hours a day involved in the markets, while mentally stimulating,
can make anyone's retirement feel like a chore.
The second failure of the day trader comes by way of commissions.
Now even E*TRADE has jumped on the bandwagon and joined the futures
revolution by offering 99-cent commissions. Commission rates are playing
limbo around the world, to actively recruit futures and forex traders. The
problem is that no matter how low they go, they will always beat the cus
tomer. You have to think of the commodities house as a bookie joint. No
matter what side the customer is on, long or short or whether he wins or
loses, the brokerage makes money. And the dirty little secret of the indus
try is the fact that the lower the commissions, the more the customers will
trade.
Like anything in life, if you think that you are getting a deal for some
thing you buy regularly, you simply buy more of it. That's how Costco and
Sam's Club work. Those two companies are continually making record
breaking profits. There is no material difference between how these retail
outlets generate business and trading. The perceived discount in trading
encourages the traders to trade more. Does this mean that there is less
slippage or that the market is less likely to move against you? No! Not only
have all your risks stayed the same, but you have increased your exposure
to them simply because it seemed cheaper to do so.
One of the most influential studies on the topic, "Do individual day
traders make money?" (Brad M. Barber et al., 2004), took a serious look at
the day trading phenomena by analyzing 130,000 investor accounts. Their
abstract put forth many straightforward conclusions, one of which was,
"Heavy day traders earn gross profits, but their profits are not sufficient to
cover transaction costs." This is an alarming revelation. If you are solely
a day trader, you are not working for yourself: You are working for the
brokerage.
The goal of the day trader must be to make a gross profit, with the
aim of keeping as much as possible and giving as little as possible back in
transaction costs.
Swing Trader
Investopedia defines a swing trader as "A style of trading that attempts to
capture gains in a stock within one to four days."
The level of research that has been conducted on day trading simply
doesn't exit for swing trading. The flexibility of the time frame means that
a trader may hold onto a trade for a few days or a few weeks, depending
on the end goal.
Like their day trading counterparts, swing traders attempt to gain a
few hundred dollars or more and they also attempt to limit their exposure



==================================================

==================================================

Some Essentials of Trading 51
to the markets by minimizing the amount of time spent in the trade.
There is the assumption that the market moves in a particular direction,
whether up or down, for only a finite amount of time before it retraces or
pulls back.
The role of the swing trader is essentially to pick when the move begins
and to get out right when the move ends. This ability is akin to being able to
pick market highs and lows. The swing trader is looking to find out when
the market is going to explode on fundamental or technical information
and how much of a profit they can gain while it is moving.
This is nearly an impossible task to undertake. Many swing traders
tend to be system or black-box traders. They look for the market to be
packaged as a black-and-white scenario of "get in here and exit there." The
problem with this style of trading is that its predictive nature can lead to
a lot of false entries and exits. You can be fooled by false entry signals or
exit trades too early, losing all your profits by chasing the markets to catch
that last little move.
If the market could be predicted to behave in a certain way then there
would be no need for books, videos, and seminars about trading. We would
be better off learning how to read tarot cards or astrological charts. The
markets are really a microcosm of human psychology coupled with a dose
of insider trading.
With the limited knowledge afforded to the retail trader, it is difficult
to pick absolute tops and absolute bottoms. By attempting to trade within
these parameters there is a significant need for risk management as op
posed to money management in order to protect yourself from the un
known.
The weakness of the majority of swing trading is the belief that stop
losses or risking only 2 percent is sufficient risk management. This could
not be further from the truth. While less demanding in actual face time in
front of the trading screen, swing trading requires a lot of preparation time
to detemline entry, profit, and loss exits. This preparation time is essential
in order to set i trade and forget it. A lack of preparation time along with
an insufficient risk plan leads many swing traders to give up.
Position Trader
A position trader (trend trader) is defined as "a trader who attempts to
capture gains through the analysis of an asset's momentum in a particular
direction." What these position traders are looking to do is to make the big
bucks, no matter what the day-to-day fluctuations may be. This is similar
to buying and holding stocks. The belief is that there are only two ways
to make money in the markets: either you can afford to make quick sniper
attacks or you catch a trend at its beginning and hold on.



==================================================
                     PAGE 66                      
==================================================

52 DESIGNING THE TRADE
There is sound logic in wanting to be a position trader, particularly in
the current commodity bull market. The euro has increased from .89 cents
to breaking over $1.50. If you had traded a euro futures contract you would
have made $76,250; if you had held onto a euro spot trade you would have
made $61,000. The same thing has happened with crude oil. Crude oil, has
gone from a price of $12lbarrel to breaking over $100lbarrel. A position
trader that caught that entire move would have made $88,000.
Position trading can have great rewards, as the above examples can
attest to. The core problem with position trading is that only with 20/20
hindsight can we see the actual result of buying and holding. During the
wild fluctuations of the markets' movements it becomes difficult to main
tain a conviction. Long or short, position trading can be unnerving at times.
Rarely does a market simply move straight up or straight down. The
peaks and valleys along the way give the illusion that a trend has stopped or
a move is reversing itself, only to have it resume unexpectedly. While on the
surface these moves may not amount to much more than a few percentage
points here and there, the margin leverage makes it difficult to hold onto
trades for the long haul. For example, if you trade a market with a 10 to 1
leverage, a 4 percent move against you is the equivalent of a 40 percent loss.
What trader would willingly give up 40 percent gains in order to make
just 10 percent? None in their right mind, but that is what is asked of the
position trader time and time again. By not knowing if the particular mar
ket they are trading has reached its plateau, a position trader must be
willing to give up what he has for the possibility of gaining more. This
simple fact makes it difficult for small retail traders to be both psycholog
ically and financially prepared to properly hold onto trades for the long
haul, even if they know that the market will continue in the direction
they expect.
A TRADER'S FOCUS
By highlighting some of the problems of day traders, swing traders, and
position traders, it becomes apparent that focusing on time frames in order
to define yourself as a trader may not be the most successful way. Each
of these time frames is just as capable of producing successful results as
another. They should be treated as fluid parts of a whole which can be
incorporated at any time, depending on the market's activity, rather than
artificial constraints.
Instead of fixating on various time frames, professional traders tend
to take a specialist approach. They may specialize in bonds or short sell
ing or a particular strategy, or they may combine all three. The specialist

Some Essentials of Trading 53
approach to trading allows them to incorporate fundamental infonnation,
multiple market time frames, and a specific set of technical analysis tools.
By removing time as the definitive determinant of a trader's success,
the market dictates whether you become a day, swing, or position trader.
Specialization is liberating in its confinement and teaches you how to read
the rhythms and opportunities according to what's most appropriate, not
according to your whim. Millions of dollars have been made by stock spe
cialists and traders in the pits in Chicago.
Instead of focusing on a time frame for trading, traders should look to
three arenas to specialize: market, buy or sell, and technique. By specializ
ing in one or all of these areas, the time frame has a tendency to take care
of itself. The benefits of specialization far outweigh the negative of missed
opportunities.
Market Specialist
Retail traders have a tendency to watch too many markets. They want to be
involved with gold, oil, S&P 500, cocoa, lumber, euro, and so on, all at one
time. This is counterproductive. Their reasoning is that they don't want to
miss anything. They simply do not see the material difference between gold
and lumber or the euro and the yen. They are all interchangeable when it
comes to opportunity.
Two problems arise when speculation is approached in this way. The
first is that not all opportunities are created equal. By approaching gold
the same way you approach wheat, you are ignoring several key factors.
There is a difference in leverage, difference in fundamental factors, and a
difference in volatility that affects each market.
The second problem is that you will miss opportunities by trying to
watch everything at once. Computers have changed the life of the trader
tremendously. Each trade setup can be programmed and the trader can be
alerted to the setup. Unfortunately, as often happens, by the time you are
alerted to the activity the move is underway and you are effectively chasing
the market. Or you can be faced with too many choices, with little chance
of discerning which one will actually take off and which one will not. This
type of trade cherry picking can be frustrating and adds another layer of
decision making that can cause trading hesitation.
The professionals that trade in the pits of the com market trade one
thing and one thing only: com. The professionals that trade in the pits
of crude oil options only trade crude oil options. Many of them success
fully earn a living focusing on one market. This can be replicated by re
tail traders. By focusing on one market, retail traders go from being just a
trader to a euro trader or a wheat trader or an oil trader.



==================================================
                     PAGE 68                      
==================================================

54 DESIGNING THE TRADE
By becoming a market-specific trader you liberate yourself. Much like
your current ( or former) profession, there are trade journals, conferences,
magazines, and seminars designed for these specific industries. Each is a
fount of information that can give you fundamental knowledge and "public"
industry secrets that you would not have access to as an average trader
following a few signals.
Couple this additional knowledge with the prescient ability to under
stand a market's rhythm, solely because you trade it exclusively, and you
then begin to approach the san1e level of market savvy that professionals
have. From this level of trading comes the ability to choose a day, swing,
or position trade depending on the market's needs, not your own.
Buy or Sell Side Specialist
Who says you have to buy and sell? While it is easy to become caught
up in buying stocks, few people ever short stocks. Many stock investors
that come to futures or forex trading go to the extreme: they simply buy
and sell too much. Since longs and shorts are treated the same when it
comes to futures and forex, it is easy to get whipsawed in and out of
positions.
If a trader finds himself losing money in his long position, they he may
go short; if the short position is losing money, he then may go long. There
are no rules against this activity and what many traders find themselves
doing is chasing the markets. This constant chase generates commissions
for the brokerage, not necessarily profits.
Not all signals are created equal. In a long-trending market, is shorting
the best thing to do? In a short trending market, is buying the best thing
to do? By limiting trading activity to the market's most probable direction,
you can develop a laser-like precision in making your trading decisions.
You also learn patience.
All traders operate with a finite amount of capital. Whether it is a few
thousand or a few million dollars, successful trading can only be achieved
by limiting your trading activity to the opportunities that are most likely to
succeed, not by taking every chance that comes your way. Not all opportu
nities are created equal.
It is said that trading is much like playing baseball, in that the more
times at bat the more likely you are to succeed. If you swing at obvi
ously bad pitches you will skew your batting average or even worse-strike
out-unnecessarily. The san1e can be said of trading. Taking every buy and
sell signal that comes your way is in no way superior to trading solely longs
or solely shorts.

==================================================

Some Essentials of Trading 55
Technique Specialist
Many professional traders come up with one or two techniques that help
them trade the markets efficiently. The goal is to help them minimize their
losses while at the same time maximizing their opportunity to profit. Some
times the technique will be something as simple as selling options, other
times they can be as complicated as butterfly spreads. No matter what the
technique is there are always three components.
First, a trading technique must have a built-in risk management compo
nent. Selling options, you might rely on the fact that the majority of options
that reach expiration expire worthless (approximately 75 percent). Or, on a
spread trade, you limit your downside risk to the difference between a long
and a short. Second, a trading technique must be able to be consistently ap
plied to various trade and market setups. Finally, a trading technique takes
account of capital appreciation as secondary to capital preservation. This
is very important.
Professional traders have a fiduciary responsibility to their clients to
preserve their capital, above all else. If they fail in that responsibility it
prevents them from collecting incentive fees and will eventually halt their
trading altogether. Retail traders should not take their fiduciary responsi
bility to themselves any less seriously.
Which Is Better: Time Frame or SpeCialization?
There is a debate as to whether it is better to be a day trader or a swing
trader. This debate is rather futile. The market is the best determinant of
how long you should be in the markets. No one in their right mind holds on
to a losing position simply because they are swing trader, nor will they cut
off their profits right in the middle solely because they are a day trader.
Their actions would break one of the core tenets of trading, "cut your
losses and ride your profits." That's just common sense. Yet, time and time
again, traders break the only rule that makes their trading successful. This
is done solely to adhere to an artificial time constraint that the market
doesn't put on itself.
Is there any wonder that so many traders have difficulty when it comes
to trading? They want to let their profits run, but their day trading system
forces them to get out as quickly as possible. Position/trend traders insist
that the trend is their friend, but they won't cut their losses because the
trend has not "officially" changed. Time frame trading is detrimental in the
long run. No market will neatly adhere to the time frame you want to trade.
The market will do what it wants and if you are not careful enough to pay
attention to it, your trading will be more difficult than it needs to be.

                     PAGE 70                      
==================================================

56 DESIGNING THE TRADE
On the other hand, when you specialize in a particular market, market
direction, or strategy you give yourself the freedom to trade any time frame
based on a different set of criteria. You are fixated on optimizing your prof
its by managing your risk. Whether a 5-minute chart or a 30-day chart, you
make it infinitely easier to enter a trade and cut your losses. This is the key
benefit to choosing specialization over time frame.
Pure Trader versus Flexible Trader
If it isn't broke, don't fix it!
If you are happy and successful with the type of trading you're doing
then the techniques presented here will be helpful. The intent is not to stop
you from doing what works. The goal is to expand your horizon and make
your decision-making process more flexible, based on the markets' rhythm,
not your own.
Much confusion results when traders attempt to follow market tru
isms, but feel their hands are tied because of arbitrary time frames. While
being a pure trader can be an effective way to earn profits, you must decide
whether you want to make living at it or you are only looking to make extra
income. Depending on that decision, various time frames mayor may not
work for you.
Forcing yourself to be a day trader is a difficult task if you are sim
ply looking to earn extra income during your retirement. You may want to
\ travel or take a vacation, and the moment you walk away from the screen
is the moment you stop having the market work for you.
On the other hand, if you are trying to earn a living from the markets
and are looking for monthly market trading results to pay the bill, swing
trades may take too long for you. Whatever the case, you don't have to
force yourself to be a different trader than what your lifestyle can accom
modate. You can accomplish your goals regardless of the time frame, as
long as you keep your eyes on your ultimate profit-making, risk manage
ment objectives.
ESSENTIAL TRADING (;ON(;EPTS
There are very few pieces of vital information necessary to effectively use
the strategies given here. No matter what trading system or time frame you
operate in, you must be able to determine five things at any given time: en

ing anyone of these of bits of information you are better off sitting on the
sidelines.

Some Essentials of Trading 57
The simple creature that the market is, dictates that it can only move
in one of three directions at any given time; up, down, or sideways. Traders
have to figure out a way, to the best of their ability, to take advantage of
the up, down, or sideways movement. The straightforward approach of the
average retail trader requires that they buy when the market goes up, sell
when the market goes down, and stay out of the market when it moves
sideways.
The problem with the straightforward approach arises when the mar
ket doesn't follow the game plan. You go long or short, the market moves
in the opposite direction for a little while, then sideways, then back in your
direction, and finally collapses into the opposite direction. Until now, the
only response for the retail trader was to use a stop to protect them from
loss. Yet still traders lose money.
By dissecting a trade into its five core components you give yourself
the ability to exploit the market the same way that professional traders do.
You go one step beyond stop orders and the need to predict the markets.
You are capable of exploiting the entire daisy chain trading effect with
grace and ease.
Daisy Chain Trading Effect
If there is any secret to trading, it lies with how effectively you manage
margin and leverage. The typical approach to margin and leverage is to
view it as a dangerous enemy. Whether it is futures, spot forex, or options,
the fear of the leverage they provide can be paralyzing. This does not need
to be the case.
Futures, spot forex, and options were not created in a vacuum. While
they may be traded separately, it was never the intended purpose. Futures
and options, along with many more sophisticated instruments, were de
signed to operate as insurance for the cash market. Whether the cash mar
ket is stocks or actual gold and oil, futures and options were created to
help protect the owners from losing money.
Time and time again, throughout my books and in my seminars I talk
about the daisy chain trading effect. The cash market is protected by fu
tures, which is protected by options, and options protect both cash and
futures markets. When the market is looked at in this way a host of oppor
tunities open up. No longer is the leverage or margin your enemy, but a part
of your risk management plan.
This feeds directly into trading flexibility. It quickly becomes appar
ent that opportunities are created by combining the advantages of the
various derivatives products with each other and the cash market to maxi
mize returns and minimize losses. In a world in which you use the various
forms of leverage and margin together you are able to buy stock shares, but

58 DESIGNING THE TRADE
guarantee that your loss won't exceed the strike price of the option, or
CFD (for my international readers), that you have put in place to protect
yourself. You can combine spot forex trading with futures forex contracts
without batting an eye.
This is the approach that professional traders take to trading. Nothing
is sacred. You neither attempt to fixate on a time frame, nor do you artifi
cially constrict yourself to one type of financial product. The reality is that
technical analysis can be applied in the exact same way, no matter the fi
nancial product. So there are few, if any, benefits to being just a commodity
trader, or just a forex trader, or just a stock trader.
By being aware of the daisy chain effect and then utilizing it, retail
traders develop a proactive approach to the markets. The emphasis shifts
from profits to loss management. This is a necessary shift in order to
achieve longevity in trading. Developing ways to minimize loss first allows
profits to handle themselves. This is the core of the professional trader's
approach.
Risk lUanagement Is Not the Same as Money Management Loss,
loss, loss! This is what risk management deals with. Managing your loss.
Whether you use stops, limits, or any of the other strategies given, all risk
management does is explain how you manage loss. Money management,
however, deals with how you handle your money "win, lose, or flat." There
is an essential confusion between the two topics. Money management deals
with how you treat the money in your account. Risk management deals
with what you do when faced with the risk of losing your principal and
profits.
Stipulating that the most you will risk on a trade is 5 percent or that
you will only commit one-third of your principal to the markets at any given
time are both money management rules. They have no bearing on what you
do to achieve these goals. But if you say that every time you put on a trade
you will use a stop to protect from losing 5 percent of your account value,
then you have risk management.
In this way you separate the actions you take to protect yourself from
loss, from the amount you are willing to lose. You can adjust the amount
from 5 percent to 50 percent, yet still maintain the same set of risk manage
ment strategies to get the job done. Knowing the difference is essential to
understanding how to react to the markets when your principal is affected
by sudden gains and losses.
Five Core Components of a Trade Setup
Now you have become more flexible in your trading. You no longer define
yourself in such rigid terms as day, swing, or position trader. You have

become more of a market specialist. You have found the few markets that
you want to trade and you now find yourself open minded to the daisy
chain effect that bears on the markets you watch. Are you ready to get
started yet? Not quite.
To develop an effective risk management strategy and to fully utilize
the daisy chain effect to your benefit, you must be capable of identifying
five core pieces of data. Three of them are lumped together: entry price,
loss price, and profit price. These three prices are essential to determining
if the risk of the trade is worth the profit potential. The second two pieces
of information focus on time. It is essential to determine if you are trad
ing with trend or the counter-trend. Which one you trade will effect the
likelihood of you achieving your profit targets and also how quickly.
Entry Price, Loss Price, and Pl'ofit Price No matter what time
frame you attempt to trade in there are only three prices that every trader
must be concerned with: the trade entry price, the loss target price, and
the profit target price. Each one of these components must be determined
in advance in order to confidently execute a trade and to decide ultimately
what to do, whether the trade is failing or is successful.
In Winning the Trading Game we covered various technical analysis
tools that help you determine how to effectively come up with the neces
sary entry, loss, and profit target prices. Knowing these numbers is essen
tial to developing your flexibility as a trader and devising the proper trading
strategy to approach the market. These three numbers alone will give you
the necessary vision to determine the full potential of a trade.
As with many trading suggestions, finding key prices is simple but not
easy. Once established, they reduce your need for guess work. They be
come the facts and figures you use to design your trade. They illuminate
what your potential losses and profits will be. At the same time, it is not
necessary to be 100 percent perfect in choosing any of them.
It has been said that W.D. Gann had an uncanny ability for forecasting
trades. In 1909 a reporter witnessed 286 winning trades and only 22 losing
trades. This gave Gann an accuracy of 92 percent. Too many traders believe
they have to have these same types of results in order to be successful. The
reality is far from it. Of the three numbers you need to know: entry, loss,
and profit; your entry price is the least necessary.
Markets move swiftly, and while you always want to get the optimum
entry price, slippage can affect your fill. This phenomenon makes specific
entry prices unreliable. It is better to use entry price as a guideline rather
than a set-in-stone number. It is more important to know how you will
exit a trade. Knowing your potential loss exit price and your profit exit
price are essential and should not be afforded the same flexibility as the
entry price.

                     PAGE 74                      
==================================================

60 DESIGNING THE TRADE
These two prices, loss and profit, are essential in calculating your po
tentialloss and your potential profit. They are the best way to determine if
the trade you are thinking of taking is worth the risk. The traditionally ac
ceptable "risk of loss rule" is the willingness to risk one to gain two. While
this equation can be effective in assisting traders in estimating what their
potential trade success could be, it rarely works out.
It is one thing to know what the numbers are; it's entirely another thing
to be able to trade those numbers properly. This flaw is not the fault of the
trader- even though traders will typically blame themselves-but more so
a fault of the tools at their disposal. The inaccuracy of using stops and lim
its by themselves makes it difficult to have any sense of control in your
trading. With the problem of slippage, missed opportunities of limit orders,
and the self-defeating nature of stops, they only get you out when the mar
ket has momentum against you. It is no wonder why so many traders are
frustrated with them.
With the limitations that stops and limits have, you want to mini
mize their overall use in your exit prices as much as possible. The more
rigid you are in dealing with your exit price, the more likely you will suc
ceed in the long run. This is the place where more emphasis should be
placed by the trader, rather than in attempting to discover the best entry
price.
'frend and Counter-trend The trend and counter-trend are two more
key components that every trader must be able to successfully identify. If
you cannot determine whether you are entering a market when it is trend
ing or counter-trending, how will you know where to place your primary
trader?
Knowing whether you are trading the trend or the counter-trend is
paramount to which entry and exit prices you choose. If you are follow
ing the trend, you will have different time expectations than if you are fol
lowing a counter-trend. Trends will typically lumber and meander towards
their destination in fits and spurts, creating multiple opportunities for any
one to jump on at the appropriate pull back.
Counter-trends typically behave differently. They are swift and aggres
sive and are actually the retracement opportunities that develop from the
actual trend. There is fast money to make and lose during counter-trends.
While they may quickly move against the trend, they lose momentum just
as fast and turn back around to follow the overall trend once again.
At some point trends and counter-trends converge and switch places.
Where once a market moved steadily higher or lower, the counter
trend emerges, acting like a quick-release pressure valve. Then some
thing changes, typically a fundamental shift in supply or demand, which

Some Essentials of Trading 61
pushes the counter-trend into new territory. It completely changes the
rhythm and tone of the markets, thereby setting up new opportunities as
the trend.
This yin/yang cycle between trends and counter-trends is important
to understand. It dictates how you interact with the markets and what
tactics you set out using in order to gain the maximum effect. This is of
monumental importance when deciding what time frame you would like to
trade in.
In the following figures there are clear examples of the interconnect
edness of trend and counter-trend activities. Looking at the daily charts
of both the gold and S&P 500 we can clearly see the trends and the coun
tertrends.
In Figure 3.1 we can see that gold has been a long-term up trend from
9/06/2007 to 03/13/2008.
In Figure 3.2 we can see that the S&P 500 is in a long term down trend
from 1010112007 to 3110/2008.
Using these same charts we can identify the counter-trends. In
Figure 3.3 we can see eight times when the market moves counter, short,
to the long-term up trend. Surprisingly, the number of days the market
moved counter-trend to the long-term trend were few. An eight-day move
in 11/2007 was the longest move of all of the counter-trends.

USING THIS BOOK TO ITS
FULLEST POTENTIAL
This book, while it can stand on its own, can also be enhanced by your
reading Winning the Trading Game. If you have a reliable trading sys
tem or set of strategies that you feel confident in, you can also use them
in conjunction with this book. As long as you can pull together the neces
sary elements on the chart: entry, loss, profit, trend, and counter-trend, you
have a key to unlocking the market's natural behavior and how you should
react to it.
There are no short cuts to learning how to skillfully trade the market of
your choice. The time invested can be well worth the effort, though. Mix op
tions with futures, right next to stocks with commodity indexes. By know
ing essential prices, the direction of the market, and the daisy chain effect,
you have an effective tool set that is designed to minimize your losses and
maximize your profits.

64 DESIGNING THE TRADE
The basic and advanced strategies presented in later chapters were not
invented by me. Professional traders and a handful of retail traders have
taken advantage of some of the ideas presented in this book and have met
with limited success in applying them in their day-to-day trading.
The reason for the limited success most likely stems from underutiliza
tion of the core components discussed throughout this chapter. The lack
of success also stems from looking at the world of trading in an either/or
scenario: win or lose, in or out. This can be fatal. It leaves little room for
the imagination to work and contributes to a lack of control, which leads
to irrational trading decisions.
By taking a step back to look at trading through the eyes of the pro
fessionals, you should realize that you do not have to adhere to any rigid
or arbitrary standards of trading and interacting with the market. You can
carve your own path in the markets, with a set of tools designed to help
you preserve your capital. By reading further, you continue on a course
that strengthens your approach to the market and actually minimizes your
losses.
The techniques given are designed to expand your risk management
palette. Where novice traders are oftentimes too content to use stops and
limits to manage their loss (Le. risk), there is a risk management world out
there, full of choices.
In this book we show you that world. Nine straightforward strategies
are presented in familiar settings and you can see how and when to ap
ply the ideas. The last six strategies take a heavy-handed approach toward
earning an income in your account while you trade.
Turn some of your bad trades around into potentially profitable ones.
These techniques will find their way into your trading and you will see re
sults. At the same time, these tactics are not the Holy Grail. They are meant
to be part of an overall trading plan and should complement your short
term and long-term trading goals.
While trading is not easy to do, its individual components are fairly
simple to describe- go long, go short, or do nothing. Yet there are so many
permutations that it is difficult to pick and choose the right path. By uti
lizing anyone of these 15 strategies you will be restricting the number of
permutations to some likely culprits. Learning this alone is worth much
more than the price of this book. So sit back and relax and use this book
as both a guide and as a reference in your day-to-day trading.

"'R'I'II
Basic Strategies
This section is a breakdown of nine strategies that have been com
piled to help minimize your risk and increase your opportunity for
success. Risk minimization is of utmost importance to professional
traders and should be no less of a concern for retail traders. While none of
these techniques is new, it's the context they've been put in that gives them
a refreshing new life; this is an important distinction.
In the world of trading there are winners and losers. The winners fo
cus on hedging their trading and the losers don't. Whether you are a pro
fessional speculator or a corporation that actually owns the products you
are buying and selling, what makes the difference is how you interact with
the market when it is moving against you. You can be reactive or proactive;
the choice is yours.
For the reactive, a stop is good enough along with the hope that mar
ket will move in your direction. For the proactive, a combination of tools
is used to exploit inherent market discrepancies. One such market discrep
ancy is the daisy chain effect. The daisy chain effect highlights the obvious
insurance aspects of the market products developed over that last 20 years.
By integrating the spot market with the futures market, and then throwing
in the options market, an entirely different level of trading sophistication
evolves.
This is what the basic strategies in the following chapters are meant
to do. They open your eyes to how the spot market is protected by the
futures market and how options can protect both the spot and futures mar
ket. Taken to its logical conclusion, you can effectively trade both sides of

the market's movement, while limiting your exposure to anyone side. This
is a significant skill when it comes to fast-moving volatile markets.
These strategies have been broken down into four sections dealing
with a time frame that each is best suited for. Whether the risk manage
ment strategy can best be used for day, swing, or position trading is sec
ondary to understanding the logic of how and why it works at all. With the
right risk management strategy you can fluidly switch from a day trade to
a position trade and back again. This comes from being willing to not be
pigeonholed into a time frame, yet being open enough to know when one
is needed.

Prediction is very difficult, especially about the
future.
-Niels Bohr
Noone can predict the future with 100 percent accuracy. Even the
world's most famous seer, Nostradamus, left much to be desired in
his cryptic messages. Predicting the future when it comes to making
money is more uncertain. What makes predicting price moves even more
difficult is that no matter what the news is, many more in:fl.uences affect the
price that aren't reported and that we don't know about.
Even with the near impossible task of predicting the future, traders
still attempt it. It is as if retail traders feel forced or pressured to predict the
markets' direction regardless of the likelihood oftheir prediction's success,
which makes the trading more of a matter of "my team is better than your
team." If you are long or bullish a market you look to justify your position,
if you are short or bearish a market you look to justify your position, and
there is no in between.
This narrow view of the market, long or short, pigeonholes a trader
in such a way that opportunities are missed. The market moves in only
one of three directions (up, down, and sideways) at any given time. The
sideways or consolidation pattern occurs 80 percent of the time. So if
a trader limits his trading to being long or short he cuts out two-thirds
of his market opportunities and he finds himself reacting to the market
80 percent of the time.
This can be a frustrating way to interact with the market. You are con
stantly on the defensive, from deciding to pick a trade, long or short, or

from having to quickly make a decision to jump into a trade once it breaks
out from its consolidation pattern. There is a better way to trade.
The secret of professional traders is that they rarely choose a side.
They do their best to increase their odds of success by positioning them
selves to take advantage of a nascent trend before it develops. The best
way to do that is to be ahead of the curve. If you can anticipate where the
market is going, you stand to make the most from any developing market
trend. Yet if we can't predict the future, how can we anticipate where the
market is going? Don't make a choice of being long or short. Be in a posi
tion to take advantage of both.
STRADDLE, STRANGLE, AND EXECUTION
Being long and short the market at the same time is practically a revolution
ary concept for retail traders, while professional traders have been doing it
since the futures market's inception. Somehow the concept has either been
lost or is considered a form of trading blasphemy when it is suggested that
retail traders incorporate this strategy into their trading. Retail traders of
ten confuse being long and short in the market simultaneously with being
delta neutral.
Delta neutral is defined in Investopedia as "A portfolio consisting of
positions with offsetting positive and negative deltas. The deltas balance
out to bring the net change of the position to zero."
The intent of a delta neutral position is to create a net change of zero.
This is in direct contrast to the goal of trading both sides at the same time,
with the intent to switch over to the winner. So while in the early stages of
being long and short the market simultaneously is to diminish your losses,
and one may negate the other in the process, holding on to both positions
after a trend has clearly been defined is not the intent and is in fact self
defeating.
Throughout the following chapters we look at various strategies that
combine long and short positions to give you a distinct advantage over
traders that simply pick long or short positions alone, hoping for suc
cess. While the strategies in later chapters become more sophisticated,
they are still accessible to any trader of any level as long as the goal is to
manage risk.
In this chapter we expose how to properly use two long-short strate
gies. The first strategy we look at is a straddle and the second strategy is a
strangle. Both strategies share a few things in common: They incorporate
options, they require that you have a long and short option on simultane
ously, and they are affected by delta.



==================================================
                     PAGE 83                      
==================================================

Holding the Bull and the Bear by the Tails 69
Delta is defined by Investopedia as "the ratio comparing the change in the price
of the underlying asset to the corresponding change in the price of a derivative."
This works in a pretty straightforward way. If you purchase a call and the
delta is 0.2, for every $1 that the underlying asset increases, the call increases
by $0.20. On the other hand, if you purchase a put, then the delta is quoted as a
negative number. As the underlying asset increases in value, the put decreases.
A put option with -0.5 decreases $0.50 for every $1 move in the underlying
asset.
Delta is one of five risk measurements that are calculated on options. It is
only one of three that we talk about throughout the book. The other two are
theta, which measures an option's price change based on time sensitivity, and
vega, which looks at an option's relationship to volatility.
Straddle and strangle strategies can also be traded in a buy side or sell
side fashion. In this chapter we look only at the buy side aspect of both of
these strategies. The sell side has the ability to expose a trader to unlimited
risk, even though traders can profit from premiums. Since the intent of this
chapter and the next several chapters to protect you from risk, not expose
you to unnecessary risk, then we do not explore sell side straddles and
strangles in this chapter.
The key difference between the two strategies is the price. When
you implement a straddle you purchase two at-the-money options. At-the
money options are the most expensive options you can purchase. On the
other hand, strangles require that you purchase two out-of-the-money op
tions. Out-of-the-money options typically are less expensive than at-the
money options, but volatility can playa factor in option pricing.
You have a distinct advantage in your trading when you apply either
of these two strategies to news announcements and potentially ambiguous
governmental data releases.
Historical commodity and futures option data is difficult to come by. Do your
best during your demo or paper trading to track relevant option pricing data.
Straddle
Technically, a straddle is considered the purchase or sale of an equal num
ber of puts and calls, with the same strike price and expiration dates. Re
alistically speaking, a straddle is a way to give yourself a choice. The most

                     PAGE 84                      
==================================================

70 BASIC STRATEGIES
difficult part of trading is choosing whether you are going to be long or
short; the second most difficult part is giving up that choice once it has
been made.
Straddles, like all of the other strategies in the book, teach you to be
aware of the rhythm of the market. You learn how to put the reality of
the market ahead of your desire to see the market do what you want it to
do. This is essential to succeed in trading. When you decide to execute a
straddle you are leaving your choice of market direction up to the market
itself, as it should be. You then are required to cut off the less profitable
position immediately. It is well worth the expense of the straddle to learn
both these lessons.
Straddles teach you how to:
1. Let the market decide the direction it wants to go in
2. Cut the losing position immediately
3. Focus on the benefits of risk management, not expense
Don't be fooled into believing that you cannot afford to put on a strad
dle. If it is the best choice for the situation, then execute it. If you are an
active trader or a day trader, a straddle may be the perfect solution for you
to achieve your goals. Whether it is a Fed announcement, Consumer Price
Index report, or jobless claim numbers, it can be very difficult to get a bead
on the market's intended direction. So instead of forcing an artificial or
rumored direction on your trading, use a straddle to establish your initial
position.
From there you can do one of two things:
1. You can close out the losing position and ride out the profits from the
winning position before the end of the day.
2. You can hold on to your winning position and convert it from an active
trade to a position trade.
Either way you come out ahead of the person who simply guesses or
predicts the market's direction and has a 50/50 shot of getting it right. Does
the person who guesses the market's direction have the ability to make
more money? Of course! If he guesses right, there is no losing trade that
eats away at part of his profits. On the other hand, it is an all-or-nothing

proposition. If he guesses wrong, there is no profitable trade to pick up
the slack.
The question to ask yourself as a trader is whether you capable of trad
ing with a 50/50 level of certainty or if you want the protection afforded
to you that hedging your bets can offer. As with all the risk management
strategies throughout this book, this one is not designed for everyone. In
fact, not every strategy is designed for every situation.
The straddle works best when it meets at least one of these three
criteria:
1. The market has been moving sideways for sometime
2. There is a news, earnings, or government announcement
3. Analysts have talked up the figures of a potential announcement
excessively
For those who are new to trading, the last criteria may be a little diffi
cult to understand. Those who have trading experience will comprehend
this quickly. Prior to any earnings decision or governmental announce
ment, analysts will do their best to predict the announcement. They will
make estimates weeks in advance of the actual announcement. This has
the affect of making the market move. Whether it's right or wrong is sec
ondary to the market's activity.
Once the actual numbers are released, the market has one of two ways
to react. It will proceed in the direction of what the analysts predicted or
it will show signs of fatigue, because the analysts were in line with what
was expected; profit taking will ensue and the market will suddenly move
in the opposite direction of what the news portends.
If the news was bullish, but the analyst had already predicted that,
and the market had already made gains up until the announcement, then
we could see a quick selloff. The identical behavior occurs if the news is
bearish. The difficulty occurs in determining when the market will move
counter to the news and when the news will simply add to the momentum
of the market's direction.
The straddle protects you from what you don't know, or what you can't
know as a trader. This is a big feat to accomplish in such a simple pack
age. Yet for all of its positive benefits, the straddle comes with a significant
drawback: price. The most effective straddle is accomplished when you are
able to purchase a put and call option "at-the-money." Since at-the-money
options typically follow the underlying asset practically one-for-one, they
can be the most expensive to purchase. This also means that once the
market decides on a direction, the losing option begins to erode in value
quickly.

72 BASIC STRATEGIES
In Figure 4.1 we take a close-up daily snapshot of the market. Leading
up to the February 27th, 2008, Federal Reserve Board's rate announcement
the market is in a fairly sideways motion.
On February 25th, after two days of a weak market, a decision is made
to put on a straddle. The consensus is that the Fed wants to lower interest
rates to stimulate the economy. The debate is more on how much they will
lower it, not whether they will lower it. If rates aren't lowered enough the
market will react with weakness; if they're lowered too much, the question
is how much inflationary pressure will be put on the dollar in the long run.
The cost of putting on the straddle is (every $1 move in a gold futures
contract is worth $100):
940 Call: 18.30 = $1,830 (Delta, .483)
940 Put: 19.50 = $1,950 (Delta, .514)
Total value = $3,780
The numbers in this chapter and others are approximations of option prices and
delta values at the time of these examples. There are many sources for options
data and they may differ slightly from source to source.

Holding the Bull and the Bear by the Tails 73
Throughout the rest of this chapter we follow how the gold market
could have been traded around this time frame with a straddle or a strangle.
Strangle
Strangles have all the same benefits of straddles. Strangles work best when
the market has been moving sideways, when there is an announcement,
and if analysts have talked up or down a position for too long prior to the
announcement.
There are three key differences between strangles and straddles. First,
strangles are executed using out-of-the-money options, so they are typi
cally less expensive than their straddle counterparts. Second, since the
purchased options are out-of-the-money, you expose yourself to the risk
of the market not moving at all. That means that you could lose money
on both your call and put solely through time erosion. Finally, delta plays
a greater role with strangles when making your decision to purchase the
proper call and put. You simply do not want to pay too much for an option
that moves less than the underlying asset.
Strangles have more flexibility than straddles. Depending on your
desired trading time frame, you can purchase out-of-the-money options
to either day trade, position, or swing trade with little worry of being
forced into a snap decision because of time constraints. This is impor
tant if you wish to see a trade slowly evolve past its initial move after the
announcement.
Figure 4.2 is the same gold chart we saw in the straddle example. This
time we take a longer view of gold's sideways action. We identify support
and resistance lines and purchase the corresponding put and call option.
The cost of putting on the strangle is:
960 Call: 8.20 = $820 (Delta, .315)
890 Put: 5.30 = $530 (Delta, .188)
Total value = $1,350
The difference of putting on a straddle and a strangle is a savings of:
$3,780 - $1,350 = $2,430
Even with such a big difference in price there are some serious draw
backs. The options themselves are anywhere from $10 to $50 out-of-the
money, which means that the market must move substantially in either di
rection before you begin to see the results of the strangle. In the meantime,
the loss in value of the option can be significant while the gains are modest

(as seen by the low deltas), as the market moves towards parity with the
underlying asset.
So the savings of $2,430 must be compensated for by the belief that you
will be able to make at least half that when the market moves in whatever
direction it is going.
Stop-Limit Strangle Using an option strangle is not the only choice
that traders have for taking advantage of potential market volatility. Stop
limit orders can operate in a similar fashion as purchasing a put and a call.
For instance, if you did not want to commit any cash to putting on the
trade, but you wanted to be poised for any potential movement, you can
set a stop-limit order at the same points of support and resistance that you
would have otherwise bought options.
There are three drawbacks to using this stop-limit strategy. First, you
cannot guarantee that your order will be filled, particularly if the market
gaps. Second, the expense of putting on a futures contract or buying shares
outright will typically exceed the price of the option. This makes the strat
egy less expensive in the short run, but more costly in the long run. Finally,
by using a futures contract or buying shares directly, you eliminate the
benefit of the limited risk that options can afford you. This means that you

==================================================

Holding the Bull and the Bear by the Tails 75
will need to add a secondary risk management strategy, such as a stop, or
purchase a protective option.
Execution
Ne ither straddle nor strangle is more effective than the other. The single
most important factor in choosing either is what you hope to accomplish.
When you set out to purchase at-the-money or out-of-the-money options, a
myriad of factors come into play.
If it's an option on a futures contract, ask yourself when the underlying
asset expires. This directly affects how long you are able to hold on to the
option contract. If you are actively trading the option you will want to be
aware of the volume so you can liquidate your option as quickly as possible.
Price, while a concern, is secondary to how relevant it is to the trading
situation at hand and the goals you have in mind.
GETTING THE RIGHT OPTIONS
FOR 1'HE JOB
Understanding option selection, having an idea about delta, and being able
to calculate the savings, values, and gains of the various options form the
essential foundation needed to utilize any of the ideas presented in this
book. By beginning with straddles and strangles you are able to play around
with using puts and calls as a risk management strategy without feeling
like you are betting the farm. As chapters progress, it becomes increasingly
more important that you have a grasp of choosing the right options to work
in tandem with your spot, futures, or margined position.
In this section we complete our review of the gold market and its re
action to the Federal Reserve's interest rate announcement on February
27, 2008; we also discuss the S&P 500's and the euro's reaction to various
other news announcements and whether putting on a straddle or a strangle
is preferable.
Economic Calendars
There is always a debate on whether fundamental or technical analysis is
superior. This is a debate best left to amateurs. The market is a complex
system that can be influenced by news, supply, and demand just as easily
as it can be dissected on the basis of price and time. While many of the
news events may have a temporary effect that can last from a few hours to
a few weeks, they should not be taken lightly nor ignored.



==================================================
                     PAGE 90                      
==================================================

76 BASIC STRATEGIES
Various economic news events have the ability to modify how hedgers
and professional traders plan out their long-tern1 strategies and approaches
to the changing market environment.
This modification can best be seen by looking at the shifting balance of
longs and shorts in the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC)
Commitment of Traders Report (COT). The COT report is designed to show
the shifts in various commodity, currency, interest rate, and energy con
tracts and options. This shift is shown, from week to week, in the fluctuat
ing balance of long and short contract holders. As long and short increase
and decrease their holdings, they are constantly reflecting the real world
changes in supply and demand.
The COT report is one of many resources used to watch fundamental
shifts in the market. Every month there are important economic indicators
that have an impact on the markets. When these reports come out the mar
ket can behave in unpredictable ways. A tutorial on Investopedia, written
by Ryan Barnes, outlines 25 different economic indicators and their impact
on the markets. Yahoo! Finance has an economic calendar on their web site
that gives the release dates and times of the 25 economic indicators Ryan
Bames overviews, plus many less-talked-about, lower-profile economic
indicators.
No matter what economic indicator you follow, when the data is re
leased it impacts to some degree how the people in the know react to it.
This means that you can set a straddle or a strangle to take advantage of
the impending news that is released. By solely trading in this way you cre
ate multiple opportunities to take a proactive stand in the markets that can
benefit you no matter which direction the wind blows.
Of the various economic indicators there are five that have a significant
impact on how the market moves. The interest rate decisions of the Federal
Open Market Committee (FOMC), Consumer Price Index (CPI), Consumer
Confidence Index (CCI), Jobless Claims Report, and Producer Price Index
(PPI) have a significant impact on how the economic health of a country is
perceived. There are also various inventory and weather reports that affect
stock indexes and commodity products as well. The goal is to understand
these various indicators and to find the ones that work for your trading
goals.
Fedel'al Open iUarl{et Committee (FO~'IC) The Federal Reserve
Board has a special branch, the Federal Open Market Committee, that
makes key decisions regarding monetary policy in the United States. Seven
of the twelve members are the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System and the other five are Reserve Bank presidents. The FOMC meets
eight times per year to determine interest rates as well as the discount rate,

==================================================

Holding the Bull and the Bear by the Tails 77
both of which have a direct impact on whether the money supply is tight
ened or expanded.
Consumer Price Index (CPI) Consumer Price Index (CPI) is consid
ered one the most definitive economic indicators around. Several other in
dicators actually use the CPI as a way to determine their own key economic
numbers. The anticipation of what the CPI will say leads many Wall Street
analysts to actively recommend the buying or selling of the equity mar
kets along with having a direct effect on how investors get involved in the
fixed-income markets. The level of impact that the CPI has directly affects
how the FOMC will react in deciding if they will encourage a loose or tight
money policy.
Consumer Confidence Index (CCI) Once a month the nonprofit
group the Conference Board releases the Consumer Confidence Index
(CCI). This information assists the Federal Reserve in determining exactly
what the average consumer is feeling about the economy, as far out as six
months in advance.
Over 5,000 homes are contacted to take part in a survey conducted by
the Conference Board. The survey's sole purpose is to help determine the
financial health and spending power of American families. By gathering
this data, the Conference Board is able to detennine the level of overall
confidence that consumers have in the economy.
Jobless Claims Report Every Thursday at 8:30 A.M. EST the Jobless
Claims report is released. This number is meant to show how many first
time filings for state jobless claims are being registered around the country.
The data itself is highly volatile. Being a week-to-week indicator based on a
four-week sample, states experience high volumes of claims that can easily
skew numbers upwards. In order to compensate for the spikes a revised
figure is released one week later showing exactly what states had an impact
on the numbers.
Producer Price Index (PPI) The Producer Price Index (PPI) is re
leased by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It comes out around the 13th of
each month. The PPI measures prices at the wholesale and producer level.
It accumulates the prior months' data and shows whether prices are in
creasing, indicating inflation, or decreasing, indicating deflation. Broken
up into three parts, it clearly shows exactly what the prices are throughout
the production cycle.
With a separate PPI Index for the crude, intermediate, and finished
stages of a products life cycle, it is easy to see where inflation is occurring
in the production cycle. With all this data, the core PPI number is still seen

                     PAGE 92

as the key to understanding the economy. It measures finished goods while
simultaneously removing food and energy from the equation. The reason
being that food and energy are too volatile to provide accurate numbers
when calculating for the real price of finished foods in any given month.
General Economic Indicators There are many economic indicators
that affect commodities across the entire spectrum. From weather predic
tions to import and export figures, various commodities are positively or
negatively affected. Whether you look at crude inventory indicators, the
Gross Domestic Product, or wait for Central Banks around the world to
make policy decisions, each one can be relevant in setting the stage for
your trading decision.
Oil traders are devoted followers of crude inventory indicators, which
represent the amount of oil currently being stored for future use. The fluc
tuations in these numbers gives a strong indicator of whether production
is matching consumption, or whether consumption has eased off. The indi
cator measures the weekly status of U.S. crude oil supplies.
The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is used by traders to determine
the economic health of a country. Strong GDPs have a tendency to buoy
stock markets; weak GDPs have a tendency to pull stock markets down.
Presented on a quarterly basis, GDP numbers have the ability to set the
economic trend for up to four months before any significant change is rec
ognized by the majority of traders. Designed to measure the market value
of all goods and services produced, the GDP is a well-balanced view of
any country's overall competitiveness in a global economy-as long as it
doesn't exceed a 3 percent annual growth rate. If the market moves in ex
cess of that, then investors worry about inflation and potential economic
bubbles. Inversely, if an economy has two negative-growth GDP reports in
a row, an economy is considered to be in a recession.
Whatever the indicator may be, when it is announced it has the ability
to polarize the marketplace significantly. This leaves room for a varied set
of trading opportunities for traders familiar with the straddle and strangle
strategy.
OPTION TUTORIAL
There are many great books on options investing. Many of them are very
detailed in explaining various types of spreads and subtle nuances of op
tions. In this brief tutorial I lay down a basic foundation about options you
can use throughout this book.

Event-Based Trading Examples
As we've discussed, the various economic indicators have a significant im
pact on how the market reacts. Within minutes a market that may have
been meandering sideways all of a sudden bolts in its chosen direction.
In the following examples we look at the tremendous effects that news an
nouncements have on various markets. It will be up to the individual trader
to decide if straddle or strangle is the best choice for trading the scenario.
Event 1: Federal Resel'Ve Announcement February 27th,
2008 On January 7, 2005, I wrote an article entitled "America's
Silent Mortgage Crisis" and posted it online (www.home-Ioan-mortgage
.info/2005/0l/americas-silent-mortgage-crisis.html). At the time it was no
secret that interest rates had reached a historical low of 1 percent and that
adjustable-rate mortgages would not be able to sustain themselves in the
face of any anticipation of a rate increase.
As interest rates increased so did the casual climb in home owner pay
ments, eventually leading up to the fiasco that has been dubbed the Sub
prime Mortgage Crisis. Attempting to make things right, the FOMC was

seen as a driving force in pushing interest rates down in order to stimulate
the economy and help people save their homes. Leading up to the FOMe's
February 27th, 2008 decision, the market moved relatively sideways for
several months. You can see this demonstrated in Figure 4.3.
On February 27th, 2008, Bernanke and the other members ofthe FOMe
clearly stated that they would continue to ease rates in order to stimulate
the U.S. economy. All infiationary pressures on the dollar took a backseat
to achieving that goal. In Figure 4.4 we see gold react positively to the
weakened dollar, moving a total of 566 ticks.
Earlier in the chapter we set up a straddle and strangle for the gold
market a few days prior to the FOMe's announcement. Each one had its
own capital commitment. While we knew that we wouldn't be holding on
to both the call and the put, there was still the initial capital commitment
that had to be made in order for the trade to be initialized. That was a total
of $3,780 for the straddle and $1,350 for the strangle.
In Figure 4.5 we see the gold market move 566 ticks. With each tick
worth $100, a total of $5,660 could have been made on the underlying as
set. Since we are dealing with a call option we know that the average max
imum delta that an in-the-money option can achieve is 80 or .8 of the actual
underlying asset. Based on that number, our hypothetical returns on the
runup after the announcement would put us at around $4,528.

Risking $3,780 in order to gain $4,528 is not the best risk/reward ratio.
And in spite of the fact that we would be releasing the put option as soon
as possible, the costs of the loss adds to our overall call expense. In a fast
moving market it could be difficult to get out of the put option without the
potential for some significant slippage.
In Figure 4.6 we look at the strangle call option and see a better
risk/reward scenario. Putting up an initial $1,350 to catch a move of 397
ticks, $3,970, fits a risk/reward profile of risking one to gain two. Even if
you lose 50 percent on the put option value, you only lose $265, for a total
real capital commitment of $1,085 (see Table 4.5).

percent; instead it moved 0.4 of a percent. This had a negative effect on
the overall U.S. economic outlook and fueled inflationary fears. The best
reflection of the CPI's overall impact is the S&P 500 stock index. Repre
senting the top 500 corporations that operate in the United States, the S&P

In Figure 4.7 we see that S&P 500 has leveled off after a steep decline
that lasted a month, from 12/26/2007 until 1115/2008. With the S&P 500 mov
ing sideways, leading up to the CPI's final numbers release, there is an op
portunity to put on a straddle and purchase an in-the-money put and call at
the 1350 price (see Table 4.6).

The S&P 500 contract comes in both a full-size contract and a mini contract. The
technique can translate to either market. The full-size contract has a value of
$25/minimum movement and the mini contract has a value of $12.50/minimum
movement and is actually one-fifth the size of a regular contract.
In Figure 4.8 the S&P 500 futures contract penetrates the support line
and falls to a low of 1250. This drop comes five days after the initial report,
generating a total move of 833 ticks. A short of the underlying asset had the
potential to return $20,825. An in-the-money put option had the potential to
return 80 percent of that.
If we were to develop a strangle trade based on the same chart, we
would use the support and resistance lines to set our buy points for our
put and call. In Figure 4.9, we use the support and resistance lines to set up
our strangle trade.
This time when the market drops past the put, it gains only 531 ticks
for a total $13,275 in the underlying asset. The put has the potential to make
approximately $10,620.

Event 3: Cl'llde Oil Inventories Febmary 21 st, 2008 On Febru
ary 21st, 2008, crude oil inventories posted an increase of 4.2 million bar
rels. At the same time crude oil derivatives, heating oil and diesel, posted a
decrease in reserves of 4.5 million. On the face of it the news had a slightly
bearish undertone on oil prices. This pushed oil prices down for the day.
In Figure 4.10 we see that oil prices shot down for the day on the crude
oil inventory news.
Two days later the crude oil prices begin to accelerate to the magic
$100lbarrel number. From there a huge breakout to the upside occurs,
driving oil prices to new highs, practically reaching $1101barrel (see Figure
4.11). This is a prime example of the markets' not following the news

and why a straddle or strangle can be beneficial in catching some of this
unexpected movement.
The movement from $97lbarrel to $108lbarrel is a significant opportu
nity to generate $11,680 in profits, if you were holding the futures contract
directly. A strangle on the same contract would have you buying a put at
the support line, approximately $85Ibarrel, and at the resistance line, ap
proximately $98lbarrel (see Figure 4.12).
In this instance the volatility of the at-the-money options make the
prospect of a straddle very unattractive. The strangle is a lot more cost ef
fective for the potential profits that can develop from an unexpected spike.
Supply and demand are precariously balanced and those traders who can
be nimble enough to ride the crude oil markets effortlessly up and down
will gain the most from its aggressive volatility (see Tables 4.8 and 4.9).

CONCLUSION
This chapter covers a lot of critical information that is used again in later
chapters. Understanding how to select options is a critical skill that you
cannot neglect. It will prove the difference between effectively managing
your risk and exposing yourself to unnecessary risk if you are not care
ful. Using straddles and strangles is an easy way to ease yourself into the
world of risk management and to learn techniques to protect yourself from
being stuck on a market position. Nevertheless, you must still make wise
decisions on how you enter the market, and understand what you hope to
accomplish once you have done so.

Trading at
Its Finest
The American Heritage Dictionary lists one definition of the word pre
cision as "of or characterized by accurate action." In the preceding
chapter we looked at straddles and strangles as ways of catching the
market's direction, regardless of which direction it is headed. While these
strategies are capable of allowing a trader the ability to beat the market
at its own game, they don't provide active traders with the most precise
way to interact with the markets. That can actually be accomplished by
understanding how to use an option contract as a hedge for your trading
position.
WHAT IS HEDGE TRADING?
In futures and forex trading there are only two participants, speculators
and hedgers. The speculators are out to make money from the simple
change in price, whereas the hedgers are out to protect themselves from
price changes. Both groups trade on the same exchange, but the key dis
tinction between the two groups is that the hedgers actually own or will
own the physical goods. Therefore, they trade the market with the willing
ness to lose money on the exchange in order to make it up with their actual
position. That is hedge trading at its simplest.
The average retail speculator fails to grasp the potential significance
that hedge trading can have for them. It is no secret that no one is 100 per
cent right about the market's direction, but little is done by the speculators
to prepare for this eventuality. Stop loss orders, whether mental or actual,

92 BASIC STRATEGIES
are used to stop losses, but no time is spent on how to make money when
a trade turns sour. That's where hedging for speculators comes in.
A speculator can look at the market and make a conscious decision
to always have a profitable position on if he is willing to concede a small
loss on another position-just like the real hedgers do. This type of hedge
trading doesn't require a lot of additional effort; it simply requires the will
ingness to take advantage of the daisy-chain effect of trading.
If you are an active trader, this may also mean that you will need to
have a willingness to change your entire approach to trading. You may have
to reevaluate it and become a specialist in exactly how you look at the
market and what buying, selling, and protecting yourself from loss actually
mean to you.
PRECISION TRADING GROUND RULES
When making the transition from a pure speculator to trading the mar
ket like a speculator, a set of ground rules must be put in place. The first
ground rule is the decision to choose a trend. No matter what time frame
you buy and sell in, there is an overall trend that the market is moving in.
In fact, as of this writing gold, oil, and the euro had all been on a bullish
trend for over four years. During that time there have been pullbacks in the
market-counter-trends. Once the market reached certain plateaus the
trend would resume. Therefore a conscious decision must be made to
actively trade either the trend or the counter-trend.
The best choice is to actively trade the counter-trends; then an option
can be purchased as a hedge on the trend. With this trading combination,
you operate just like a true hedger. There are two ways to look at this trade.
The first way is that you are protecting your counter-trend trades by using
an option as a hedge. The second way you can look at it, which is more
in tune with why the markets were developed, is that your option trade is
following the trend, generating income gradually, and you are protecting
that asset, almost like a true hedger's cash position, every time you are
actively trading the counter-trend. No matter how you look at it, you are
getting the best of both worlds, trend and counter-trend, yet as an active
trader you are reducing your commission by almost 50 percent.
The average active trader is constantly buying and selling in and out
of the market, attempting to catch a few ticks from a stock index, or
a few pips from currencies, or a few cents from stocks- all of them at
tempting to outperform the market. By using an option as a hedge to fol
low the trend, there is no need to flip-flop between being either long or
short. You are successfully placed in both positions simultaneously. Using

options as a hedge is completely separate and distinct from two other op
tion strategies-option-spot or option-futures strategies. In the next chap
ter we look at the option as a replacement to the stop loss order, and later
we look at how to combine a cash or futures position and an option to
gether to create a synthetic option.
Benefits
The options hedge strategy has many great benefits for the active trader;
commissions can be reduced, strict trade management strategies can be
followed, and trading systems can be properly tested for their viability.
Being able to reduce commissions can justify the risk management
strategy alone. Active traders are constantly in and out of the market. If
they are actively trading the S&P 500 or some other stock index, racking
up several hundred to several thousand trades per month is not unheard-of.
There is constant buying and selling pressure, with the ultimate goal
of making a fixed daily amount; $500 to $1,000 per day is the typical
target.
Reality smashes into any ideal goals that active traders have once they
see how much they lose on the losing trades and the amount they rack
up in fees and commissions. Regardless of how much or how little they
pay in commissions, they can easily find themselves generating twice as
much cash activity, in losses and commissions, as they take home as prof
its. Using an option to follow the trend requires only one commission, and
the only loss involved is the erosion of premium. This saves active traders
50 percent of the commissions that they would have usually paid, along
with cutting in half their potential for losses in their active trading.
Not all active traders attempt to buy and sell back-to-back. There are
some traders who focus on momentum trading only, so on any given day
they are only long a market or short a market. While they may not get a
reduction in commissions, they will benefit from having the option playing
cleanup if the momentum of the day is not in sync with the overall trend of
the market.
Another key benefit is the ability to refine entry and exit signals. When
the entry is limited to a specific type of situation, in this case counter
trends, trading entry signals can be honed. Whether these signals work
or not will quickly become apparent without the trader needing to be
wholly committed. This also allows for easier journaling of specific trading
strategies.
If all of these benefits aren't enough, futures traders also have the abil
ity to reduce their margins. Whenever they combine options to diminish
their risk, regardless of how they do it, margins are reduced at the commis
sion merchant level.

94 BASIC STRATEGIES
Pitfalls
Picking the right option is the largest pitfall when implementing this op
tion hedge strategy. Years ago a British television game show, The Weak
est Link, was imported to the United States. Losing contestants were told,
"You are the weakest link!" Every time the option as a hedge strategy is pro
posed, those words ring in my head. The strategy is sound in both theory
and practice, but the strike price of the option is essential to its success.
That may mean that the average active trader may not be able to afford to
use this strategy if the option is expensive or if the option exceeds the price
of the underlying asset by too much.
For those active traders who focus on the Emini markets, their com
missions and day trading margins can be exceptionally reasonable. As long
as a trader is willing to not hold a position overnight, the margin for the
Emini S&P can be as low as $250 per contract. The standard Emini S&P
contract margin typically runs over $4,000, depending on volatility, when a
contract is carried overnight. The day trading margin and overnight margin
are tremendously different. This difference allows traders with as little as
$2,000 in their accounts to trade the Emini S&P. This has to be taken into
account when suggesting to active traders to use options as a hedge for
their trading.
There are only two types of options that can be purchased to hedge
a position, an in-the-money option and an at-the-money option. Either of
these options can follow the trend effectively while the active trader exe
cutes counter-trend trades. The primary drawback is expense.
On Friday, July 11, 2008, the September Emini S&P 500 closed at
1239.75. In Table 5.1 we look at two strike prices for the front month, July,
Emini S&P 500, 1235 and 1240.
Every one-point move is the equivalent of $50. This means the calls and
puts range in price from $750 to $1,025. For an active trader who is enjoying
a high amount of leverage in his day trading position, one option is the
equivalent of three to four contracts. This can be a significant commitment
of capital in a small account.

Type Month Strike Cost Amount
ESNB Call July 1240 1 B.OO $1,025
ESQB Call August 1240 40.75 $2,037.50
A second problem staring option hedge traders in the face is attempting
to figure out exactly which month to purchase options in. In Table 5.2 the
underlying futures front month is September, but the first option contract
that can be purchased is in July, the next is in August, the one after that is
in September.
Although the strike prices are all the same, as each month gets further
and further out the built-in time value of the option plays a greater role. In
fact, the call almost doubles in value from July to August and increases by
more than $500 from August to September.
The same thing occurs when we look at puts in Table 5.3. The price
difference between the July put and the August put is such that the lat
ter option is almost triple in value. The price difference between the puts
and calls is also pronounced. Volatility is erring on the side of caution by
having the puts be slightly more expensive than the calls. This is clearly a
reinforcement of a bearish view on the S&P market.
As a trader, a balancing act must be maintained among the strike price,
the premium, and the expiration month. It is no secret that options expire
earlier than their underlying asset counterparts. This can occur as much as
a month before the underlying futures contract. Therefore, it is important
to determine whether you are content with having an option as a hedge for
protection in just the front month or your hedge position is meant to be
set in place in a further-out month and forgotten about. The option will be
more expensive, but you will be able to use it as a hedge for a lengthier
period of time.
Finally, no matter whether the trader purchases an option for the front
month or for a further-out month, he must balance the expense of the

option against what his day trading margins are and what the ultimate goal
is in protecting himself.
Can you, the trader, use an out-of-the-money option as a hedge? If you do, the
difficulty of this option as a hedge strategy becomes compounded. Not only
must you pick the right strike price and month, but you must also anticipate
where the market will head, as opposed to simply following the trend.
IDENTIFYING MARI{ET TRENDS '
How successfully this technique can be implemented is 100 percent depen
dent on how well you can determine the trend and the counter-trend. If
you are able to exploit this relationship, then all of the other dominoes fall
in place. In Winning the Trading Game there is a detailed explanation on
how to use technical analysis to determine the long-term trend of both the
futures market and the forex market. To put it concisely, the 50-day moving
average (MA) is a key way to be able to see whether the market is a bullish
or bearish market. Once that is determined, then the work of purchasing
an option that follows the long-term trend is more than halfway done.
That's when your micro technical analysis tools kick in. They help to
determine entries for the counter-trend and when to exit the market once it
begins to shift back and follow the trend. That is where your stops or stop
limits come in. While there is no love lost between my style of trading and
stops, this is one time when I wholeheartedly advocate the use of stops as
part of a risk management strategy.
The function of the option as a hedge is to operate as a profit catchall.
This technique is versatile for futures, spot forex, and stocks. The objec
tive is to actively trade as you normally would, with the intent of focusing
primarily on the counter-trend while your option accumulates value on the
trend. Stops must therefore be used liberally to exit the counter-trend po
sitions. There is no need to erode any of the profits that your option ac
cumulates through losses in the counter-trend. More than enough of the
premium is being eroded because of decreases in time value and intrinsic
value.
This is the simplest way to exploit the insurance nature of futures and
options. By working with this strategy, the everyday trader can become en
lightened about the true nature of the markets and how capable they are at
limiting risk when used in conjunction with one another. The level of im
pact that that has, coupled with the right timing, trend, and counter-trend,

is both the first step and the last step of comprehending what it means to
trade like a pro.
In the following examples, the trend and counter-trend are identified
for the Emini S&P 500. Multiple active trader time frames are viewed along
with their potential optimal returns.
Active Trader Time Frames
There is a dance between the trend and the counter-trend that cannot al
ways be seen. By separating the market's two different directions from one
another, active traders can become more effective no matter what their
preferred market time frame is. In Figure 5.1 the Emini's trend is identified.
Figure 5.1 is a snapshot of the Emini S&P 500 from April 2008 to July
2008. The gray bars represent a bearish market that sits below the 50-day
MA. At the beginning of June 2008 the S&P 500 crosses into the gray bars
at around 1375 and ends up hitting a low of 1225 by July 11, 2008. Even if
the gray bars weren't visible, there would be little dispute about the market
being on a downward slide.
Swing or position traders would have most likely attempted to sim
ply short the market once it crossed the 50-day MA. For active traders the

actions would be slightly different. As seen in Figure 5.1, once the mar
ket crossed the 50-day MA a put option would have been purchased as a
hedge. This way the active trader could pick up any profits from the mar
ket's counter-trend moves, while simultaneously catching the moves in the
overall trend in the option.
The option that was used as a hedge would accumulate a gain from
1375 to 1225, for a total of 150 points. This would allow the option hedge
to accumulate almost $7,500. This would be an enhancement to any active
trader's overall profits. Of course this is an ideal scenario, catching the
market right when it crosses into a downward trend. As long as the market
stays in the gray area, purchasing a put option is the prudent course of
action.
There are numerous time frames that active traders watch in order
to gain insight into the market's direction. There is a constant search
for the optimum time frame, and no two traders are alike. Some of the
most common short-term time frames are the 5-minute, 15-minute, 60-
minute, and 4-hour charts. Once traders have established that the market's
trend is down, they can identify counter-trend opportunities in each time
frame.

On July 13, 2008, from 6:30 A.M. to 1:30 P.M., there were at least five dif
ferent opportunities to go long in the Emini S&P 500 based on the 5-minute
charts. While there also were opportunities to go short, the put option
hedge is in place and there is no need to chase these short opportunities.
15-Minute From July 11, 2008, to July 13, 2008, we can see multiple op
portunities in the 15-minute Emini S&P chart. This is another tight time
frame. In Figure 5.3 the long-term downward trend is starting to show it
self. Yet there are at least four different opportunities to go long in the
counter-trend.
60-Minute In Figure 5.4 we see three opportunities to go long in the
60-minute chart. From July 8, 2008, to July 13, 2008, three aggressive op
portunities to go long appear.

It quickly becomes apparent that there are profits to be had in just

objectives, then trading the counter-trend, with stops in place, becomes an
effective strategy. As long as active traders are willing to not have their

long-tenn counter-trend.
CONCLUSION
On the Internet and at various trading expos, the Emini S&P is touted as the
best market to actively trade. Many traders therefore tum to the Emini S&P
to generate daily cash flow. While there is an abundance of liquidity and
momentum on any given day in the S&P, the hedge strategy is not limited
to the Emini S&P traders. Any market where traders are actively searching
for daily or short-tenn profits (stocks, forex, oil, DAX, Nikkei, etc.) is fair
game.
As long as all three components of this strategy are used together-the
ability to identify and act on the trend, the ability to identify and act on the
counter-trend, and the willingness to use a stop to exit any counter-trend
as soon as it loses momentum-then the option as a hedge strategy can be
effective.

Trading with
Hard Stops
F or swing traders, the object is to buy at a new low and sell at a new
high or to sell at a new high and buy back at a new low. Little thought
is given to whether the market is in a counter-trend trade or is a re
sumption of the overall trend. The object is to simply catch a move in the
markets that extends beyond the intraday activity. By moving from intra
day trading to daily chart trading, swing traders can increase their profit po
tential, but at the same time the exposure to market fluctuations increases.
This exposure can come in the form of unexpected announcements, supply
and demand reports, or monthly statistical reports.
Traders are constantly involved in a balancing act of wanting to catch
a greater part of a market's trend while at the same time managing their
risk. The objective is to be riding the wave of the market's direction on the
backs of those in the know. If for some reason the signs have been misread
or misinterpreted or if there has been a fundamental shift in the supply and
demand of the market, the trader wants to be able to react and get out of
the market as soon as possible. On an intraday trading chart, that could be
a matter of seconds. On a swing trade, those seconds could translate into
days. This is the bane of the swing trader: when and where to get out of a
trade that isn't working, but at the same time not exiting too early, before a
market makes its move. For years the tool of choice has been the stop loss
order.
While in theory the stop loss order makes sense as a tool that can exit
a trade when the market is going against a position, it is inherently flawed.
There is a better alternative. In much the same way we used options as a
hedge in Chapter 5 to protect ourselves against intraday fluctuations of the

trend and the counter-trend, we are also able to use options as a type of pri
mary or secondary stop loss in order to maintain our money management
rules, without the same worries that a stop loss order invokes.
STOP LOSS ORDER
Success as a trader comes from having two distinct skill sets. The first skill
set revolves around the ability to be able to pick the markets that are mov
ing. The book Winning the Trading Game discussed that in depth. The
second skill set involves the ability to have a realistic backup plan that you
can rely on when you aren't able to pick the right direction of a market's
movement. This book is designed to help you do that. It seems that for
years the only backup plan for traders has been to guess where to place
stops or to divine when the market will potentially tum around using a
host of technical analysis tools-all of this with complete disregard for the
nature of trading.
Over the years, tips and tricks have been suggested on how to get the
most from a stop order, most of them conflicting. The varied wisdom has
ranged from conservative to reckless:
â¢ Place a stop order when you put in your initial order.
â¢ Put your order in first, and then wait and put your stop order in.
â¢ Never place your stop order in; have a mental stop.
â¢ Use a parked stop order that you can execute at a moment's notice.
â¢ Place a stop order at one and a half times true range to avoid getting
whipsawed.
â¢ Don't place a stop order too tight.
â¢ Don't place a stop order too far out.
The list of sage wisdom goes on and on. Every piece of advice is a vain
attempt to defeat the inherent nature of the stop loss order. Stops are a
good idea. In fact, they are designed to be a circuit breaker when all else
fails, and when used in that way stops are effective. However, this circuit
breaker behavior is also the inherent flaw of stops. Stops are not a risk
management tool; they are a panic button to help you out when all else fails.
On its web site the Commodity Futures Traders Commission defines
a stop order as "an order that becomes a market order when a particular
price level is reached." This is a significant definition, because it clearly
points out that stop orders are a trading fiction. In fact, once they are trig
gered that is not the end of your trade; it is just the beginning of the end.
The order is converted into a market order and once that is filled, your

Trading with Hard Stops 105
trade comes to an end. Until that time you are exposed to market ineffi
ciencies; whether it's floor traders, market makers, or currency dealers,
you are left at their whim to fill your market order at their discretion.
There is no doubt that a stop order is a great tool, on the face of it.
You execute a trade, the market moves against the trade, your stop loss
order is triggered, and your trade is closed out. The problem arises when
the ideal scenario meets the reality of the markets. Using a stop as your
primary line of defense lacks both finesse and control, in much the same
way that using a hand brake on a car is inferior to using the brake pedal
during stop-and-go traffic.
Three Scenarios That Expose
a Stop Loss's Weakness
Stop loss orders are simply a tool. There is nothing wrong with them when
used properly and with the proper expectations. When a trader works
within the confines of the ability of a stop, then the frustration of stop or
ders can be diminished. The simple fact is that when you know what to
expect you can't be disappointed.
There are three situations that occur in trading that using a stop loss
order can't protect you from: fast-moving markets, consolidating markets,
and general shifts in supply and demand.
If the market you are trading experiences anyone of these scenarios,
then a stop-only approach to trading can and will backfire. In a fast-moving
market the stop is triggered, turns into a market order, and you get the
worst possible fill, known as slippage.
In a consolidating market, if your stop is too tight the market will hit
your stop loss price, tum into a market order, and get you filled; and then
the market will turn in the direction you expected all along.
If a fundamental shift in supply and demand occurs, the stop order may
be a victim of being placed too far out to compensate for consolidation, and
will be triggered into a market order that most likely will exceed any initial
money management strategy that was set in place to help protect a trader's
account principal in the first place.
The stop loss order has been promoted and marketed as a one
size-fits-all solution, and in the process it has done more harm than good.
Last ResOl't of a Desperate Trader
Stops, by their very nature, are a reactionary tool. They are triggered only
when the worst possible scenario can occur in a trade. By that time it is
really too late to do anything.
How can you realistically operate after a stop has been triggered?



==================================================
                     PAGE 120                     
==================================================

106 BASIC STRATEGIES
If your technical indicators suggest that you reverse your position, then
how do you do it without chasing the market?
If you do end up switching your market position, how can you be sure
you won't be stopped out again, thereby compounding your losses?
If your technical indicators suggest that you stay in the position, how
can you justify ignoring your money management rules that tell you to
get out?
Loss of capital, slippage, plus the high degree of uncertainty that a stop
loss comes with make it difficult for a swing trader to strictly rely on it as
a risk management tool. The stop loss order can only do just that-stop
loss-and it doesn't even do that all that well. Unfortunately, stopping a
loss is not the same as managing the potential risk of loss. One is proac
tive, the other reactive. The reactive nature of a stop loss means that it is
effective only in times of desperation, when the trader simply can't take
the pain anymore. This is not how pros trade, and neither should you.
OPTIONS AS AN ALTERNA1'IVE
TO THE STOP
There is no other way to say it. There is no other way to look at it. No mat
ter how clever you are at placing a stop loss, if it is triggered that simply
means that you are on the losing side of the market. This can be frustrating,
particularly when swing traders thrive on the exact type of market scenar
ios that stops are weak in.
Swing traders deliberately seek out fast-moving markets with mo
mentum, consolidating markets with well-defined support and resistance
points, and fundamental shifts between trends and counter-trends. The
goal of the swing trader is to be there at the beginning of a sudden run
in the market, or to exploit the highs and lows of a sideways market just as
a market consolidates, or to catch the movement of a market as it transi
tions from a trend to a counter-trend and vice versa. With this specialized
risk comes a need to minimize exposure to being on the wrong side of the
market, just in case the unexpected happens.
The use of stops only guarantees the gradual, and possibly sudden,
diminishment of a swing trader's capital through slippage and trade loss.
There is an alternative to using stop losses, however: options. Whereas
stop losses are triggered and force you out of a trade when the market
moves against you, options can be triggered into a protective mode when
the market moves against them. This can be considered a hard stop.
Anyone who has ever traded realizes that no material benefit is derived
from being kicked out of the market abruptly. There is the possibility that



==================================================
                     PAGE 121                     
==================================================

Trading with Hard Stops 107
the market will tum back your way and it will cost you more in commis
sions and missed opportunity if you decide to jump back in. If the market
doesn't tum back your way, you then have to reevaluate the potential trade
and in the process miss out on the market's new direction. If a stop is set
too far out, that means that your losses are compounded with excessive
slippage. Having the right type of stop in place solves all of those problems.
By using an option as your stop loss order, you switch the dynanlic of
your interaction from one of being reactive to one of being proactive. The
swing trader for once is in control of slippage, market timing, and commis
sion expenses. No more chasing markets, no more false market breakouts,
and no more missed opportunities. Well ... mostly. Depending on the size
of your account and your trading objectives, options have the ability to op
erate as both a primary and a secondary line of defense against adverse
market moves.
Using Options as a Primary Alternative
In Chapter 5 we looked at an option as a hedge that you can put in place
to follow a trend or a counter-trend. Later in Chapter 8 we discuss tying an
option directly to a futures or spot position in order to make it a synthetic
option position. This chapter sits comfortably between these two option
styles.
When a swing trader uses an option as a primary alternative to a stop
loss, the intent is to reduce or diminish any exposure to loss while at the
same time staying one step ahead of the market. This is directly tied into
the money management plan that is already in place. Large money man
agers will have in place a standing risk of loss that can't exceed 2 per
cent of their account value, while individual traders may be more liberal,
allowing as much as 5 to 10 percent of their accounts to be at risk at any
given time.
It is already known that no matter how craftily a stop loss is placed,
if the market gains momentum, or during a particularly volatile time in the
forex market, a stop loss can be blown through and exceed any preset stop
loss amount. A 2 percent loss can become a 3.5 percent loss, or a 10 percent
loss can become a 13 percent loss or greater. These extra erosions of capi
tal can quickly lead to an account becoming nontradable in a short period
of time.
By contrast, an option can be purchased with a strike price that is dose
to, if not exactly at, a 2 percent, 5 percent, or 10 percent stop loss. Unequiv
ocally, no matter what the market does, the strike price is fixed. The prob
lems that plagued the stop loss order- slippage, missing out on a market's
reversal, or weathering sideways activity-do not affect the protective op
tion. This doesn't mean that the protective option doesn't have its own set



==================================================

==================================================

108 BASIC STRATEGIES
of problems. The issues of premium, account size, and delta, discussed in
Chapter 4, playa significant role in cutting into profits and changing the
dynamics of the trade itself.
Option Premium and Your Account Size How you use the option
as a stop loss tool is dictated by your account size, the markets you trade,
and your tolerance for risk. This is usually figured out in advance through
your trading plan. The smaller your account, the further out-of-the-money
you have to purchase your option. This can work counter to your risk man
agement goal and in fact exceed the 2 percent, 5 percent, and 10 percent
maximum account loss you may have set for yourself. In those instances
you really have no choice but to use a regular stop loss order.
Those who have followed my recommendation in the past to have three
times the margin for a commodity contract will typically have enough capi
tal in their accounts to acquire a protective option. So if you consider your
self an oil trader and an oil contract's margin is $5,000, then you should
have $15,000 in your margin account. If you trade spot forex, I recommend
you have five times the margin for each contract. So if you purchase a euro
contract that requires only $1,000, have $5,000 in the account.
Choosing the Right Stril(e Price for Your Option Getting just the
right option strike price can be a problem. Each futures contract has its
own incremental option numbering. This can make it difficult to obtain an
option that is exactly 2 percent, 5 percent, or 10 percent of your account's
value.
Let's look back to our $15,000 oil trading account example. If your
money management rules cap your losses to just 2 percent, then you can't
risk more than $300, a 5 percent loss would be $750, and a 10 percent loss
would cap you at $1,500.
Attempting to use a protective option as a hard stop will be difficult
at the 2 percent and 5 percent levels. The option strike prices move only
in $500 increments. This is in stark contrast to the fact that the underlying
futures contract moves in 1 cent increments, which equal $10 per 1 cent
move.
If you were to enter a futures oil contract at $100 per barrel, you could
put a stop loss order at $300 away from your entry, at $99.70; but if you
attempted to purchase a protective option, then you would have to get a
strike price of $99.50. This adds an additional $200 to your protective loss.
If you attempt to stick to a 5 percent stop loss of $750, your only choice
is to purchase an option with a strike price of $99.50 or $99.00. That would
be either $500 or $1,000 away from your entry price. That's either $250 too
little or $250 too much.

==================================================

Trading with Hard Stops 109
The only scenario that fits perfectly is the 10 percent ($1,500) risk of
loss. If you enter an oil contract at $100, you could then purchase an option
with a strike price of $98.50. This would be a perfect match, but it wouldn't
make sense to readjust your entire money management strategy to make a
perfect match on the strike price. If anything, it is better to err on the side
of caution and go with a strike price that may represent a lesser risk of loss
than a greater risk of loss.
Delta and Theta Eroding Your Premium Chapter 4 thoroughly ex
plored delta's and theta's effects on premium. It is important to keep in
mind two facts: First, the protective option is meant to protect the over
all position against loss, not necessarily to become profitable. Second, the
options you will be purchasing will be out-of-the-money; therefore, they
will be affected more by delta and theta than an in-the-money option.
Using Options as a Secondary Stop Loss
The second way to use a protective option is in conjunction with a stop.
The closer an option is to its underlying asset, the more expensive it will
be. It stands to reason that an option placed at a 2 percent loss threshold
will be more expensive than an option placed at a 10 percent loss threshold.
Whether because of account size, number of contracts placed on the trade,
feeling a premium is too expensive, or simply looking for a way to stagger
your trades, having a stop loss order in the first position and a protective
option as a secondary stop loss can be an advantage.
There are three scenarios that can play out.
In the first scenario, the market is moving quickly. If a there is a tight
stop loss order, say at 2 percent, then a trader can exit a losing position
immediately, with some slippage. The average retail trader would then at
tempt to chase the market's new direction by entering a new order and
quite possibly end up being whipsawed.
A more relaxing alternative is to have the stop loss order in place at
2 percent and a protective option at 5 percent or 10 percent. The stop loss
order is triggered and a loss is booked into your account. Instead of chasing
the market, you wait for it to come to your protective option. If the market
breaks through the strike price of your protective option, your protective
option begins to accumulate profits. If the market begins to tum around
at or near the option strike price, you can reenter your original futures or
forex position and tum it into a synthetic options position.
In the second scenario, the market is predictably bouncing between a
consolidating resistance and support line. As traders we hope for the best,
but we prepare for the worst with a stop loss order.

                     PAGE 124                     
==================================================

110 BASIC STRATEGIES
In the final scenario, the market is shifting from a counter-trend to a
trend. If your trade is going in the expected direction to the contract's
price, then you are trading the trend. Any pullback would be considered
a counter-trend. While the market attempts to choose its ultimate direc
tion it begins to consolidate. These consolidating markets tend to be the
most difficult for stops to navigate. It is quite rare for any market to move
straight up or straight down. Along the way the market will pull back.
Unfortunately, you never know whether the pullback is simply a market
that is consolidating or there is a fundamental shift in the market's direc
tion. Stops treat both situations the same, so when a stop is triggered you
are forced out of the market, period. There is little you can do if the market
was simply consolidating and it halts its move against you and begins to
move in the direction of your original position. This is known as the whip
saw effect.
CONCLUSION
Since stops are an all-or-nothing proposition, they leave little room for the
market's constant consolidation and retracement behavior. This has the ef
fect of you potentially being right about the market, but being stuck on the
sidelines because you were stopped out. A well-placed option can have the
opposite effect. If you place an option where you would have placed your
stop, you are able to hold on to a losing futures position slightly longer.
Even if the delta of the option is different from the underlying futures con
tract, as you lose money on the futures position the option helps offset
some if not all of your losses as it gains in value. This gives you the neces
sary breathing room to determine whether the market is consolidating or
changing.
Finally, stops have difficulty navigating fundamental shifts in the mar
ket's supply and demand. When these fundamental shifts occur, the most
benign result of using a stop is some slippage, as we discussed earlier. In
the worst-case scenario you could find yourself in a lock-limit market un
able to get out, with the potential of losing more money than you invested.
Once a market is at the lock limit, all trading is halted until the price stabi
lizes. Markets can be lock-limit for days on end; all the while you have little
recourse and you are racking up losses at a phenomenal rate.
When it comes to trading, there are no fix-aIls, simply substitutions. An
option in place of a stop loss order is just that, a substitution. By comparing
stop loss orders and options side by side, options clearly come out the win
ner in each scenario. Over the years the difficulty of using stops alone has
been recognized. There is a clear alternative to using stops alone to manage

losses-options-but it requires that you look at trading the same way that
money managers do. Money managers look at the interdependence of fu
tures and options contracts and the built-in risk management relationship
that they have with one another to diminish their losses. By taking this
approach they are able to use finesse and control to protect themselves
from fast-moving markets, consolidating markets, and fundamental shifts
in supply and demand, and now you can, too.

The Markets
on a Leash
R andom House Unabridged Dictionary defines a leash as "to
~ecure, co~trol, or rest~,ain ..." or "a chain, strap, etc., for control
lmg or leadmg ... ; lead.
In Chapter 6 we explored using options in place of a stop loss order.
This strategy, while having the added expense of purchasing either an in
the-money option or an out-of-the-money option, is the simplest way of
guaranteeing that your losses won't exceed the price you enter the market
at. Whether it is a hedge position or a synthetic futures position, it is the
only efficient way to protect your trading position.
It can be difficult to afford the protective option if your account is too
small, or if the volatility of the option is too high, making it very difficult
to pay a reasonable price. That's when you have to make the decision to
control the cost ofthe option and make the protection affordable enough to
protect yourself. A small but important technique that puts you in control
of your trading destiny is the simple ability to sell an option in conjunction
with your synthetic futures or hedge position. This is how you put your
trade on a leash.
The combination of being long the futures, purchasing an at-the-money
or out-of-the-money put option, and selling an out-of-the-money call is
called a collar. The mirror opposite can be done for a short position as
well. A collar is a limited-loss, limited-profit strategy that diminishes your
overall trading expenses, while still affording you the same protection that
a protective-option-only strategy gives you.
In this chapter we look at the long collar and short collar position.
The intent is to analyze how to use them, the benefits of using them, and
the drawbacks of using them as a risk management strategy. We then

explore how day traders can convert their spot and CFD positions into
collar trades that may help them tum their trades into long-term protective
position trades.
COLLAR
A collar is partly defined by Investopedia as "a protective options strategy."
This is an oversimplification of a strategy that has the ability to lock in
profits, reduce risk, and improve overall returns. The strategy itself can be
implemented either at the inception of a trade, when you feel that you can
estimate particular levels of support and resistance, or after a trade you
have executed has moved in your direction for a while and you want to
lock in profits.
With a little bit of trading savvy you can expand your hold on a trade
almost indefinitely. By properly managing the trade through a collar you
protect yourself from sudden drops in price while catching the profits when
the market moves in your anticipated direction.
Collar at the Inception of a Trade
The collar requires three components: the initial trade, long or short; an
out-of-the-money option that is purchased to lock in profits, either a call
or a put; and an out-of-the-money option (which sits ahead of your initial
trade) that you sell. For instance, if you have a long collar trade on the euro
(see Figure 7.1), you purchase aput at support, go long the market, and sell
a call at some point of resistance.
If we look at an example in a different time frame, we see a run up in
the value of the euro. This time we see a peak, along with an opportunity to
short the market. We purchase a call, short the market, and explore the two
options to sell puts. The further out-of-the-money, the lower the premium
we can collect. But we also give ourselves more breathing room by not
capping off our profit potential too quickly. Figure 7.2 shows an illustration
of a short collar trade.
Benefits and Drawbacks Placing a collar on at the inception of a
trade can make sense in some cases; there are some key benefits, as well
as drawbacks, to keep in mind.
There are three key benefits to using a collar at the inception of a trade.
First, you are able to calculate your potential profit right away, whether
the contract is futures, spot, SSF, or CFD. This can be comforting when

116 BASIC STRATEGIES
your intent is to adhere to a strict risk/reward ratio for your trade. If you
intend to not risk more than $1 to gain $2 or $3, the potential maximum
gain quickly becomes apparent.
Second, by initiating a collar trade at the beginning of a trade's exe
cution, you are afforded some protection if the market moves against you
quickly. You are essentially putting on a synthetic trade, which can be very
expensive because you are purchasing an at-the-money option as a form
of protection. The collar has a sold option component that allows you to
collect some premium to offset the costs of the at-the-money option. While
you will not cover the entire cost of your option purchase, you will be able
to cover a part of your expense.
Finally, you have two distinct ways to profit. You can profit either from
the trade with your primary short or long position or from your purchased
option position and collect the premium. A standard trade would require
you to be long or short and use a stop loss to protect you from the market
moving against you. A synthetic trade will allow you to catch a market drop
if the market moves against you, but a collar trade will pay you for being
wrong through the premium you collect.
With all these fantastic benefits of using a collar immediately upon in
ception of a trade, there is one essential drawback. You make your money
from picking the right market direction, not from the options. While the
options are designed to protect you from various drops or pull backs in
the market, if the core trade never develops, you have to the risk of losing
money on the option you purchased as the time value erodes. Depending
on how quickly this occurs, you could end up losing a significant amount
of your principal while you wait for a trade to evolve. This is where under
standing the option greeks becomes important.
When to Use a Long Collar at Inception In Figure 7.1 we see that
the euro has a well defined support line at the $1.2100 price level. In the
past the euro failed to break through the $1.2680 area and created a point
of resistance there. At the $1.2195 area we see an opportunity to go long
the euro.
In establishing a collar position to take advantage of these key areas of
support and resistance a trader can purchase a put option at $1.21. A call
is sold at the resistance area of $1.27. To cap it off a long position is estab
lished at $1.2195. In Figure 7.3 we see the results of this euro collar trade.
The euro takes off and spends two months attempting to get back and

Each one-cent move in the futures contract is equal to $1,250. The long
futures contract collects profits from $1.22 to $1.27; this is the equivalent

would have made a $5,000 profit (one-cent move = $1,000).
In Winning the Trading Game we recommend that you never let your
protective option decrease more than 50 percent of its face value. In this in

an in-the-money-option (see Table 7.3).
Collar to Lock In Profits
A slightly different approach of using a collar is similar to using an option
as a stop or hedge. The trade is executed, either naked with a stop loss or
der or with an option as a hedge. The primary trade, long or short position,

accumulates a profit. You feel that the market has more to go in your direc
tion, but you don't want to risk everything you have already made.
In this case a trader has only a few choices at his disposal. If he
uses a moving stop to lock in profits, the usual problems of slippage and
attempting to chase the market arise. If he attempts to convert an option
hedge into a moving option synthetic, then he is constantly fighting two
phenomena simultaneously: the loss in option premium value for the ini
tial protective option that is sold off while its intrinsic value is declining,
and the high cost of constantly replacing the former options with declining
intrinsic value with the purchase of new at-the-money options that have
an increasing intrinsic value. Eventually the difference in value between
the two option contracts has to be made uQ somewhere and they end up
eroding most, if not all, of the profits accumulated in the primary position.
A happy medium is the collar. A collar can replace an option hedge
or stop loss order that is no longer relevant for the market's current price
levels. Figure 7.6 shows a prime example of when a collar can take over for
an option hedge position.
In this instance the trader executed a long futures position by purchas
ing oil at $74.13 and underneath that, an option put is purchased at $72.50.
This put is slightly out-of-the-money and costs $3,300. Depending on how
you exited the option you could potentially lose only 50 percent, or $1,650
of the initial option.

The subsequent protective put that is bought as part of the collar is
significantly more costly. In Table 7.4 we see that an at-the-money put costs
$5,010 to purchase at a strike price of $84.50, which is where the market
broke resistance. In the meantime, a call is sold at around the double top,
hovering at the $96.50 area for $1,710. This collected premium of $1,710 is
used to offset the losses of the first option hedge that was exited, giving a
net difference in price between the option hedge that lost money and the
premium collected of +$60.
See the dynamics of the final trade in Figure 7.7. The underlying futures
have a gross profit of $22,310. The loss on the collar's put totals $4,950
(the premium of $5,010 minus the $60 left over from the sold call). This
brings the collar trade to a grand total of $17,360 in profits.

122 BASIC STRATEGIES
Benefits and Drawbacks By using a collar trade to lock in your prof
its, in this instance you protected a little over $10,000 in profits. On the
other hand, you had to put up $5,000 in order to achieve thi:s. Coupling this
with an option hedge strategy may not be the best of all worlds because the
option premium you collected is eroded by the value you lose in the option
you purchased. The question to ask is whether the risk is worthwhile. Did
you risk one to gain two? The answer is a resounding yes.
Because of the collar, by spending $5,000 on an option, you were able
to double your profits from $10,000 to over $20,000. You were also able to
make twice as much as the risk. Constantly being aware of your money
management and what is at stake makes a collar like this worthwhile.
GENERAL COLLAR PITFALLS
Collar trades are not a panacea for all the world's trading ills. They have
some serious flaws to be watched and monitored. You need to pay attention
to the value of your options to determine whether they are too far out-of
the-money or too close. You also need to be concerned about expiration of
the options to the underlying contract and whether you should be risking
accumulated profits at all when making trading decisions.
The collar trade is heavily reliant on options and how well they coin
cide with the underlying position. There is a fine balance between how
much premium can be collected on the option sold versus how much
money must be spent on the protective option. If the collected premium
is only a fraction of the value of the purchased option, then the un
limited risk associated with it and the capping of your underlying con
tracts profits must be weighed carefully against what you hope to gain in
return.
In the scenarios presented in this chapter, each time an option was sold
the collected premium was the equivalent of at least one-third the value of
the potential loss on the protective option. You should consistently target
this amount in your trading, while at the same time attempting to achieve a
one-for-two risk ratio when it comes to risk and reward goals. This can be
a difficult balancing act, but it must be consistently attempted to achieve
the maximum benefit from using a collar.
Couple the price balancing act with the fact that options can expire
prior to the underlying contract and that means there must be constant
vigilance on the part of the trader in watching the different moving parts
of a collar. Target profits must be strictly maintained, and there must be a
willingness to hold on to the underlying contract until expiration to cover
the costs of a potential sold in-the-money option occurring. For the retail

trader who is intent on trading like the professionals, monitoring multiple
bits of information simultaneously is a juggling act that is well worth the
effort, as long as your principal is safe.
DAY TRADERS
There is nothing more important to a day trader than being flat the market
at the end of the day. No matter the circumstances (win, lose, or draw),
making sure that no capital is at risk of being exposed to overnight market
gaps defines what day traders are all about. This attitude is both good and
bad. The good is that it keeps traders focused on their activities, making
sure they take no opportunity for granted as well as teaching them the
discipline to exit losing trades quickly and efficiently. The bad is that many
winning market decisions are cut off at the knees.
By ending your trading decisions during the day, large trends are being
ignored. In spite of what random walk theorists propose, the market has
a memory. What occurs today affects what will happen tomorrow. This
effect is particularly felt when traders are involved in markets that deal
with macro-economic influences, such as currencies and stock markets.
Yet the two most commonly day traded or actively traded markets are cur
rencies and stock indexes.
No one would argue that the Dow Jones has steadily increased in the
past 20 years, nor would they argue that the euro has made a steady beeline
up in value since its inception. Nevertheless, the insistence on day trading
these markets negates the fact that there has been more value that has
been achieved by buying and holding these particular markets for the long
haul. This is in sharp contrast to attempting to scalp profits on the short
and long side on a daily basis while simultaneously losing money because
of predictive mistakes.
There is a reason why weathermen can predict the weather two
months from now, but can't tell you precisely what it will be like on
any given day. There are patterns that present themselves from a bird's
eye view that simply can't be seen when your face is pressed against the
canvas. This is where collar trading comes in. Day and active traders can
convert their winning trading decisions into something more than just a hit
and run. They can use options to protect their downside risk as they go for
a longer-term trending profit opportunity while having the market pay for
their protection by collecting premiums.
At any given time a day trader or active trader can exit the primary
trade, but there won't be a requirement that they do it. Worrying about
losing everything in case the market gaps overnight against your position

124 BASIC STRATEGIES
becomes a feeling of the past. Active traders can have an option in place
to protect them and sell an option to collect a premium to offset the costs.
A collar strategy, when compared to the actual amount of losses and com
missions that can accumulate during day trading, is a small outlay of time
and money in order to open up more profit-making opportunities. This can
be an effective way for active traders to catch major trends in addition to
the day-to-day fluctuations that they attempt to scalp.
Spot Forex Traders
Spot forex traders are some of the most volatile traders around. With lever
age as high as 500 to 1 in some instances and penalties for holding posi
tions overnight, spot forex traders are constantly in and out of the market.
Trading under such extreme pressure is not for everyone. The majority of
traders who are forced to operate like this actually end up making unnec
essary mistakes and burning through their principal. Only by stepping back
from the canvas of active trading can spot forex traders truly see the big
picture.
Here we take two examples of the euro. The first example is in
Figure 7.8. This is part of one day, 6/4/2008, of the euro's market activity

Although the market moves with extreme highs and lows, no real dis
cernible market direction jumps out at you. Large swings in bullish and
bearish activity present various types of trading opportunities at differ
ent times. Yet this daily chart is like peeking through a keyhole. It doesn't
present the fact that the euro has moved almost 80 cents since it began
trading. It doesn't give you an idea of whether you are trading a trend or
a counter-trend. Nor does it indicate, with any sort of reasonable expecta
tion, the amount of momentum that the market will follow through with on
the next day.
In Figure 7.9 we can clearly see that the market has had at least four
definitive directions from 2/2008 to 5/2008, in sharp contrast to the erratic
activity of the daily charts. In Chapter 5 we explored the option as a hedge
in depth for the spot forex market and stock index trading. To make the
option hedge for both of these commonly day traded markets even more
effective, the strategy can easily be converted into a collar strategy to cover
your option expenses. In today's sophisticated trading environment, every
little advantage that you can get becomes increasingly important; this is
that advantage for the active trader.

CONCLUSION
The collar trade is not perfect. Like many of the strategies presented
throughout the book, it has positives and negatives. Unlike many of the
strategies in the book, it has a simple way of strengthening an opportunity
while reducing your overall exposure. It can be applied in multiple situa
tions with varying degrees of versatility. As a retail trader becomes more
skilled in how the markets interact with one another, this particular strat
egy will become second nature.

Replacing
Traditional
Options with
Synthetic Options
Option trading can be very liberating for individual traders. Options
offer traders the opportunity to have unlimited profit potential with
limited risk. No matter who you are, small trader or money manager,
if you can limit your risk up front it becomes more comfortable to take the
risk. Options have the ability to provide a high level of comfort. There is
simply no misunderstanding what you are getting into when you purchase
an option. If you invest $400 to purchase a call or a put, your risk is limited
to the $400-no more than that, but possibly less if you sell the option early.
This is not the case when it comes to all investment products.
Spot forex, stock, or futures trading cannot afford you the san1e pro
tection that options can. A wrong decision in anyone of these markets and
your losses can mount up quickly. The usual stop losses or stop limits can
not protect you from slippage or gap ups or gap downs in price. Stop losses
or stop limits cannot protect you from limit up days or limit down days. Nor
can they protect you from fundamental changes in a market's supply and
demand. In the end, no matter what money management goal you have in
mind, when you trade spot forex, stocks, or futures you have to be willing
to accept that one bad trade has the potential to wipe out your entire ac
count, and in the case of futures and trading stocks on margin, your losses
can actually exceed your account value.
However, while options can limit your risk to the premium paid, by no
means are they perfect. They have two main problems: choosing the right
strike price and managing volatility. Although the risk may be limited,
success is predicated on the ability to pick the right strike price. The risk
of an option is limited to what is invested, but in order to truly benefit
127

==================================================

128 BASIC STRATEGIES
from purchasing an option, a trader must be an expert at seeing the future.
However it is done, a trader must pick the exact price that he believes the
market will not only reach, but exceed, on a certain date. This is known as
the strike price.
Choosing the right strike price is difficult, to say the least. A trader who
is clever enough to choose the current market price is penalized. Buying
an option at the current market price is known as buying at-the-money.
Typically, at-the-money options are more expensive and have a tendency to
be adversely affected by the second problem mentioned earlier, volatility.
If the trader makes a decision to buy an out-of-the-money option, then the
trade-off is paying a cheaper premium for a strike price that may likely
never match up with the underlying asset's price.
Options are derivatives of an underlying asset. This means that they
derive all of their value from another more important asset. By themselves
they actually have no value and thus would not exist. This leads to a com
plex price relationship between the option's premium and the underlying
asset's increase or decrease in value.
Various types of option styles exist, but for the purpose of this book
we are strictly addressing American-style options. As a rule of thumb,
American-style options grant the holder the right, but not the obligation,
to buy or sell the underlying asset at any time. This simple fact increases or
decreases the perceived demand for the underlying asset, which can affect
the price of the option, regardless of what the strike price is or how close
its price is to the underlying asset's price. This tenuous relationship has led
to many traders, retail and professional alike, to simply not be comfortable
with buying options. The difficulty of having to calculate the volatility, or
theta, of the options (we discussed the greeks earlier, in Chapter 4), and
then having to trade the volatility, independent of the actual price moves,
can simply make option trading unappealing.
There is a third alternative, an alternative that couples the limited risk
of options with the free-flowing opportunity of being in the actual underly
ing asset. This third alternative also has the unique ability to let a trader leg
out of his position and profit from a market's move regardless of where it
goes, up or down. This third alternative is known as the synthetic option.
It successfully combines the best of all trading worlds.
SYNTHETIC OPTION VERSUS
STANDARD OPTION
Synthetic options come in one of two flavors, synthetic calls or synthetic
puts. They each are designed to simulate a standard call or put option with
out the drawbacks. A synthetic call is simple to initiate. A long position is



==================================================
                     PAGE 143                     
==================================================

Replacing Traditional Options with Synthetic Options 129
first established in a spot forex market, futures market, or stock market;
then an at-the-money put is purchased to protect the long position against
any downside risk. A synthetic put requires that a short position be initi
ated first and an at-the-money call is purchased to protect the short po
sition from any sudden moves to the long side. They are one of the most
underused risk management tools available.
Throughout this book different ways to use options have and will be
introduced. The two strategies of using options as a hard stop or using
options as a hedge are distinct from the synthetic option because of one
factor, the use of an at-the-money option. The at-the-money option is an
essential component. While it may be more expensive to purchase an at
the-money option, it establishes the necessary maximum protection for the
long or short position.
The Greeks and Synthetic Options
When trading a standard option, there is the constant stress of the greeks.
In Chapter 4 we looked at delta, theta, and vega. The delta assesses how
much the value of an option moves in relation to its underlying asset. No
matter how successful the option, it will rarely move dollar for dollar with
its underlying asset. This is not a problem for synthetic options. Since one
side of the synthetic option is the actual asset, delta does not playa factor
when the synthetic option moves into-the-money.
The greek value theta measures the time value left in a standard option.
Since options have finite time until expiration, the more time you have until
they expire the more valuable they can be, regardless of the strike price.
As every day gets closer and closer to expiration, the time value erodes
and the option decreases in value proportionate to the time it has left. With
a synthetic option you can eliminate the time value completely. If one leg
of the synthetic option is a share of stock, spot forex contract, or contract
for difference (CFD), there are no time limits on when you have to exit or
how many times you have to roll the contract over. Therefore, there is no
built-in time value to actually lose in the position.
Finally, the third greek component, vega, was created to measure im
plied volatility. It measures how much an option's price will increase or de
crease depending on an option's level of demand. Understanding and using
vega is great when determining what strike price to purchase for an option.
Volatility is everything when it comes to options trading. The lack of volat il
ity in any particular option can be so detrimental as to make even a success
ful strike price be worthless because no one is interested in purchasing it.
Vega does not have an impact on synthetic options. There is no sec
ondary market of volatility that has to be monitored or followed. If the
market is moving up, your synthetic long position is gaining in value; if the
market is moving down, your synthetic short position is gaining in value.

130 BASIC STRATEGIES
Delta, theta, and vega are just a few of the greeks that have an impact
on option pricing. There are other greeks that are also followed religiously
by traders who buy and sell options. None of these greek calculations
directly apply to a synthetic option position. In fact, any attempt to follow
the greeks for a synthetic option most likely is a waste of time.
Strike Price, Premium, and Synthetic Options
When you purchase an option, you must decide whether you are going
to purchase an in-the-money, at-the-money, or out-of-the-money option.
Depending on which option you purchase, you will pay either an expen
sive or a low-cost price for your premium. The price that is paid for the
option premium plays a significant role in how successful an option can be
in the long run.
The further out-of-the-money your option is, the less premium you pay.
At the same time, the further out-of-the-money the option strike price is,
the less likely it will be for the underlying asset to reach that price. If the
underlying asset does move in the direction of the strike price, there is a
missed profit opportunity that occurs due to the difference between where
the underlying asset started from and when it reaches parity with the op
tion's strike price. On top of that, even after the asset and the option strike
price do reach the sanle value, the option does not become profitable until
after the underlying asset exceeds the value of what was paid on the option
premium. All of this activity takes time, which, as we learned through the
greeks, options really don't have much of.
This what-if scenario then forces traders to assume that in order to be
successful in options trading, the more money that is paid on the premium
the better off they are. An expensive premium means that the option is
either at-the-money or in-the-money, but this does not necessarily make it
better than an out-of-the-money option. The moment an underlying asset
begins to move against an in-the-money or at-the-money option, the value
begins to decrease rapidly. Just like an out-of-the-money option, breakeven
is the premium plus the strike price of the in-the-money or at-the-money
option. This means that as a trader you already start your trade in the red
when you purchase your option, and any move against you simply digs you
a deeper hole.
For the most part, synthetic options do not have to deal with premium
and strike prices in the same fashion as standard options. Since the un
derlying asset is the primary driving force behind all of the activity, the
initiated position is at-the-money right from the start. There is no premium
that is being eroded, nor is there any set strike price that needs to be hit
before any money is made. In fact, the ideal scenario when putting to
gether a synthetic option is to see the protective option's premium erode

in value. That's when you know you have chosen the right side of the
market.
However, when the premium erosion of the protective option does
kick in, it can be a double-edged sword. Every dollar you lose in the protec
tive option is subtracted directly from every dollar you make in the primary
position. If the protective option is not monitored and acted upon immedi
ately, the synthetic option has the potential to mirror a standard option.
This means that your profits won't really kick in until the premium of the
protective option is covered 100 percent. This could end up defeating your
purpose for executing the synthetic option in the first place: control.
The Elegance of a Synthetic Option
A standard option has one risk management objective, to limit loss to the
premium paid. That's it. It is not designed to follow the market's rhythm
or flow. When you are wrong, your trade ends. For a synthetic option,
things are not quite the same. Being wrong is just the beginning of some
thing great.
Whenever a trade begins to move against a standard option or regular
position, there are two things to consider. First, has there been a fundamen
tal shift in supply and demand that is fueling this shift in the market's di
rection? Second, how long will this movement last against my position-is
it a minor correction or a long-term shift?
For a standard option or regular position trader, if there has been a
fundamental shift in supply and demand, then the position will most likely
expire worthless (if it's an option) or accrue heavy losses (if it's a regular
position). For an option trader, even a minor correction might as well be a
long-term shift in supply and demand. With time against the option trader's
position, every day that the trade passes through a correction phase is an
other day closer to losing everything.
By themselves, regular positions and options have a hard time with re
acting to change. While all kind of crutches can be used to minimize the
losses of a regular position or a trader can resign himself to losing his pre
mium, there is another side to this story. Synthetic options take the best of
both worlds by combining protection with instantaneous reaction.
A synthetic option combines the fast-paced movements of a regular
position with the limited risk protection of an option, then adds in the abil
ity to switch trading directions instantaneously. These three strengths are
built right into the trading strategy.
If the market is having a minor correction, the protective option is
there to collect value until the market turns back around. If there has been
a fundamental shift in supply and demand, the losing position can be re
leased and the protective option can easily pick up the slack without being

132 BASIC STRATEGIES
perceived as chasing the market. These strengths are automatically recog
nized by the clearing firms; that is why they give synthetic option traders
low margin rates on their futures positions.
Stop losses can't reverse your position at the drop of a dime. Limit or
ders can't. Even standard options fail in this respect. To trade successfully
over the long run you will need to be able to have the prescience to change
your market positions even before the market knows where it's going. By
combining a futures contract or cash contract with an option to create a
synthetic position, this is done for you automatically.
This strategy alone puts you in the advanced class as if you were
hedger or trading professional. Trading with a synthetic reinforces your
understanding of the interrelationship of the markets and how to hedge.
This is a significant tool that places you ahead of the competition.
S~'Ilthetic Option Drawbacks
No matter how great the benefits are, when it comes to trading synthetic
options there are still some drawbacks. The first drawback is the fact that it
is capital intensive. The option must be purchased up front and the margin
or cash for the position must be put in place. This means that you essen
tially have two trading positions at the same time.
Another drawback is the erosion of the protective option. Even though
your profits are made by the primary position, the protective option is still
subject to the same general problems of all options, time decay and volatil
ity. Whatever money you spend on your protective option's premium has a
direct effect on your overall profits. Therefore, it is important to maintain
constant vigilance on the protective option to make sure you are getting
the maximum value out of the trade. The general rule of thumb mentioned
in Winning the Trading Game is not to allow a loss of greater than 50 per
cent of your premium. It can be even less than that if you are certain of the
market's direction.
A third problem is the impact that the losing futures or cash posi
tion has on the overall trade. While losses mount $1 at a time, the max
imum that the protective option can cover is approximately 80 cents of
that (effects of delta), even if it is in-the-money. This is important to un
derstand when attempting to detemline how effective the protection can
be. Therefore, the synthetic option cannot be considered a panacea for all
trading ills.
A fourth problem is the timing of option expiration versus its same
month futures counterparts. When marrying the put to the futures or
cash position, the option's expiration date is a key factor. If the option
is purchased in the same month as the futures contract, then the op
tion expires three weeks to a month prior to the futures contract. If it

==================================================

Replacing Traditional Options with Synthetic Options 133
is not done properly, you could be left with either exiting your trade
early or protecting your trade with a stop or limit order earlier than you
expected.
The only alternative to purchasing an option in a near or front month
is to purchase an option with a further-out expiration date. Yet this alterna
tive has its own consequences. As we discussed earlier, an option has two
values built in, intrinsic and time value. Therefore, an option purchased in
a further-out month has more time value built into it. This makes it more
expensive and more susceptible to changes in volatility.
Finally, a balance must be struck rather than having an all-or-nothing
attitude when it comes to synthetic options that work against you. There is
a school of thought, with this and all of the other risk management strate
gies, that when the primary position begins to move against you the entire
trade should be scrapped. There is another school of thought that the trade
can be legged out of, keeping the winning position and letting the bad po
sition go.
If the trade is legged out of, then traditional forms of risk manage
ment, such as stops or stop limits, have to be put in place. Couple this with
the loss of the special margin rates you may be getting from the clearing
firm, and it may not be favorable to leg out. Legging out of a position also
changes the dynamics of the trade. Where it may have been comfortable
to put on a swing trade or a position trade with the synthetic option, if it
is converted to a standard position the trading time frame will have to be
changed.
How you tackle these drawbacks to synthetic options is a testament to
your mettle as a trader. Whether it is the expense of the options, the ero
sion of the option value, the effects of delta, option expiration, or legging
out the position to capture the profitable side of a market's move, it is the
trader who will ultimately decide on how to best use a synthetic option for
maximum benefit. Typically, during this discovery process, the opportuni
ties of synthetic options will outweigh the drawbacks.
WHEN TO USE A SYNTHETIC OPTION
A synthetic option is both a subtle and a powerful tool. It is not meant
to be taken lightly. It is simple to use and its nature lends it to be most
useful to swing traders. If a market appears to have reached its absolute
low or high, then a synthetic position can be put in place just in case
the market doesn't follow through on its turnaround in a new direction.
As the trade progresses, the synthetic position can be closed out at the end
of the market's move.

==================================================

134 BASIC STRATEGIES
Another place a synthetic option can be helpful is when the market
is bumping against certain levels of resistance and support, with an eye
to the potential that the market may break through. Traditionally, if the
market did not break through resistance or support, a stop loss would be
the only tool getting you out of the position. Instead, the protective option
is there just in case the market fails its breakout. The synthetic option is
truly a subtle way of attempting to outsmart the market while covering all
your bases.
In the next few examples we will look at breakouts and support and
resistance patterns, before and after, in order to get an idea of how best to
use synthetic options.
Synthetic Calls
To reiterate, a synthetic call involves the simultaneous actions of going
long a market and buying an at-the-money put in order to protect the posi
tion. We will first look at how a synthetic call can be applied to a breakout
market in gold, and then we will find a point of support in the oil market
and use a synthetic call to establish a trade.
Brealmut Example In Figure 8.1 we see that gold prices began an ag
gressive rally to the long side after failing to break through $850. The mar
ket is so strong that it rallies for five days in a row and breaks through the

50-day moving average (MA). Both of these signals are bullish. There is re
sistance at $950, and after that it is at $1,000. To not miss out any further
on this aggressive move up, we initiate a synthetic call.
We purchase a put option as close to the money as possible at $930.
The cost of the put is $1,830. The long gold futures contract is added to
complete the synthetic call for a spread margin rate of $1,000 (spread and
SPAN margin rates will vary from brokerage and futures commission mer
chant [FCM] rates), instead of $4,455. The total synthetic position requires
a commitment of $2,830.
This is $1,625 less than an outright futures contract and is $800 more
than an at-the-money standard call option (see Table 8.1).
The only way to make the long gold futures and call option work is to
put stops to protect them in case this gold break turns out not to be sus
tainable. In Figure 8.2 we see this new rally stall and then collapse below
the 50-day MA. It attempts to get above the 50-day MA, but the bulls sim
ply cannot get their footing. The price eventually hits a low of $866, right
around previous support.

136 BASIC STRATEGIES
The put option gains a profit from $930 to $866 for a total of $64. If the
long futures contract is exited when the market crosses back below the
50-day MA around $910, the position nets a total of a $44 gain, which would
net the synthetic call holder approximately $4,000, give or take a few hun
dred dollars based on delta changes.
This is a prime example of how a trader can attempt to catch the mo
mentum of a breakout and actually get caught at or near the top. Noth
ing was done wrong technically, but the underlying fundamental supply
and demand factors simply could not sustain the move. A standard long
oriented position (futures or call option) that simply followed the technical
analysis would have simply lost money.
Bouncing Off of Support In Figure 8.3 we take a look at the crude oil
market as it finds support around $85 per barrel.
This is the third time that the crude oil market has come down to this
price level. The prior two times the market bounced up and either broke
through the 50-day MA or at least hit the 50-day MA. The Relative Strength
Index (RSI) is showing that the market is oversold, and the price itself is
sitting on the lower Bollinger band. These all point to the potential that it
could be a turnaround to the long side.
Despite all of these technical analysis positives, three glaring negatives
stick out like sore thumbs. First, the market is having a down day; there
fore, any long move is preemptive of the market's actual move. Second,

neither the 9-day nor the 20-day MA is showing any signs of turning around.
Third, the 50-day MA, while fairly tight, is at least five bars away as indi
cated by the last time the market failed to break the 50-day MA.
By taking advantage of the indicators early, a synthetic call makes the
most sense just in case the market drops like a stone.
In Figure 8.4 our early assessment is rewarded. The market turns
around and in three days breaks through the 50-day MA and doesn't look
back. It makes a beeline from $85 per barrel to $110 per barrel. This time
the synthetic call costs us money. Whereas in the gold example the protec
tive put became an asset when the market collapsed, the put we used for
the oil synthetic option turned into a liability immediately.
In Table 8.2 we can see that the capital that was committed to the syn
thetic call came out to about $7,700; while less than the actual futures mar
gin of $9,788, it is more expensive than a call option by $3,310.
This is an example of the greeks rearing their ugly heads. Since
the market was moving downward when the original synthetic call was

138 BASIC STRATEGIES
initiated, the put option turned out to be more expensive than the call
option. By the time the market moves up to the 50-day MA at $90 per barrel
the put option should have dropped in value by $5,000 (every $1 move is
equal to $1,000). The delta, intrinsic value, and time value will each playa
role in how much and how fast the put will lose value. Nevertheless, it is
important to note how quickly an at-the-money option can lose value once
the market begins to move in the direction of the primary trade.
Had a call or an outright futures contract been purchased at the time,
none of the standard option problems could have become an issue. Nor
would the profits from the primary position been eroded by the losses of
the put. This is the trade-off for operating with a synthetic position. It is
there for the just-in-case scenario. The loss on the option is a cost of doing
business. That is why set rules of when and why you will get out of the
losing side of your synthetic option become paramount to your 10ng-tern1
success.
S)llthetic Puts
Synthetic puts face the same challenges that synthetic calls face. In this
instance a synthetic put is comprised of buying a call and shorting the mar
ket. When the market moves in the direction that the trader wants, the
protective call option will be afflicted by loss. When the market moves in
the direction that the trader doesn't want, the protective option will gain.
This is the nature of the synthetic option. Exiting the losing trade quickly
will test the prowess of any trader.
Failure to Break Out In Figure 8.5 we take a different approach. The
primary trade is a spot euro transaction. We use a futures call option to
protect against any sudden moves to the upside. The futures options, as of
this writing, are more liquid than the spot euro options and ultimately more
reliable.
The top half of the figure is the spot euro contract. The market has
penetrated the 50-day MA, confirming weakness.
In Figure 8.6 the euro currency finds support at $1.34 and begins to tum
around. Eventually it hits the 50-day MA on the way up. This is definitely
the cue to exit the spot euro position. A small loss is accumulated while the
market moves sideways. The call option gains value from $1.36 to $1.40,
netting 4 cents on the option position and bringing in approximately $5,000
in profits.
This example is simply meant to show you that the synthetic call can
be implemented in any forn1at. Even if there are no benefits to be gained on
a decreased margin rate, it does not mean that a protective option cannot
pick up the slack if the market moves against your primary position.

Trading Resistance
The S&P 500 in Figure 8.7 is coming off of a triple top. The RSI is turning
down, indicating a collapse from the market being overbought. The 50-day
MA is fast approaching the price. Everything is indicating a possible break
through to the short side.
This market can be attacked either as a full-size contract or as an Emini
contract. However it is tackled, the mechanics are the same. A call option
is purchased at 1570 and the market is shorted at 1572. A two-point gap
dictated by the option pricing puts you as close to an at-the-money option
as you can possibly get.
With this market our profit target is obvious: the point of support at
1526. This would give the trade 46 points in profit on the short position. For
a full-size contract, that translates into a profit of $11,500, minus whatever
we could potentially lose on the call position. An Emini S&P 500 contract
would net $2,300 for the same 46 points.
The spread margin for a full-size contract can be as low as a few thou
sand dollars compared to a full margin of $22,500. In order to get the
maximum profit, it may be worthwhile to trade the full-size contract as a
synthetic call and tap into the spread margin rates instead of the Emini S&P
500. The ability to implement this type of strategy is 100 percent dependent
on how flexible your brokerage will be. It would also mean that you may
not be able to unmarry the option and the contract, even if the option is

losing money, without getting slapped with a margin call to hold on to the
position.
In Figure 8.8 the S&P 500 not only hits the first target of 1526, it drops
even further to a low of 1475. This is a perfect example of the type of wind
fall that can occur when the rules of a trading system are adhered to. The
complete drop from 1572 to 1475 represents almost a doubling in the profit
opportunity.
CONCLUSION
There are benefits to using synthetic options for both swing and position
traders. There is the flexibility of the trade, the superiority over volatility,
and the elimination of the strike price. Synthetic options simply have a way
of outshining their traditional option counterparts, particularly when there
are clear signs that the market is about to break out, either into a rally or
into a collapse.
Synthetic options have overcome the limitations of time decay and in
trinsic value as well. They leave the nasty greek calculations that pertain to
these elements in the dust. The synthetic option has the power to liberate
and protect your trading both at the same time. This is an unprecedented
leap in the world of risk management. The trade is protected from down
side risk, margins are cheaper for the futures traders, and the synthetic

options still preserve the limited loss function and the unlimited profit po
tential of standard options.
No matter what the drawbacks to synthetic options are, they have the
ability to even the playing field between retail and professional traders in
one fell swoop. How a trader handles this newfound footing is entirely de
pendent on what his midterm and long-term goals are. The more realistic
his expectations are in understanding what profit and loss truly mean, the
easier it will be for him to adapt his style of trading to the hedged trading
that synthetic options represent.

Everything in
Its Season
I f it can be said that one concept in this book has most influenced ev
ery seasoned trader's idea of what risk management can be like, that
concept would be spread trading. The idea of seasonal spread trading
has been around since the inception of the commodities exchanges in the
United States. Based on the dual impact of storage and planting, seasonal
spread trading has greatly influenced the way all types of traders, retail and
commercial, interact with various commodities. The concept is very well
promoted, and had I not discovered the concepts behind seasonal spread
trading this book would not have been written.
There is a dark side to seasonal trading. Companies run radio ad
vertisements and late night infomercials touting seasonal trading oppor
tunities, without the spread component. These advertisements hyping up
seasonal opportunities are intended to create a sense of urgency.
AB harvest season approaches, you will see ads focusing on droughts
or floods that could affect com crop yields. AB summer approaches, there
will be ads that are intended to make us believe that American summer
drive-time behavior is a new phenomenon, although it is well known that
gasoline prices historically have increased during summer months. Com
mercials also promote natural gas prices when winter storms hit the north
eastern United States. Other naturally occurring trading phenomena are
promoted but rarely understood. While all of these occurrences are based
on historical, well-known facts, the actual seasonal opportunities rarely
materialize the way they are promoted.
Seasonal trading has gotten such a bad rap that licensed NFA brokers
are legally required to tell their clients that seasonal trades cannot be relied

upon when making decisions. The clever statement used is "Past results are
not indicative of future returns." Therefore, if you decide to take advan

hedgers and speculators, have attempted to take advantage of any seasonal
trade or common market discrepancy by using spread trading. This simple
strategy requires the willingness to do two things-have a market bias and
be willing to both buy and sell contracts of a particular commodity in dif
ferent months.
Spread trading is designed to simulate hedging, which forces clearing
firms to offer deep margin discounts to spread traders. Clearing firms do
this because the act of selling in one month and buying in another month is
assumed to be a protective trading activity-in other words, that one con
tract will protect the other from loss. By their very nature spread trades
are considered to be low-risk, high-profit transactions. Despite all the pos
itives, though, they are still flawed. It is always possible that a spread will
narrow when you want it to widen and widen when you want it to nar
row. In either instance you will find that not one but both trades are losing
money simultaneously.
In this chapter we first explore the long and the short spreads. Next
we look at various spread opportunities. While seasonal trades are great
opportunities to put spreads on, you can take advantage of other spread
opportunities that are based on what counts most: current market condi
tions. A retail trader who takes advantage of these additional spread oppor
tunities moves out of the realm of fundamental guesswork into the realm
of financial arbitrage.
SPREAD OPPORTUNITIES
Spread opportunities can take multiple forms. Whether based on substitute
goods, differing time frames, or predictable supply and demand chains,
spread trading opportunities exist everywhere in some form or fashion.
Detailing all of them is a subject for another book. Therefore, I have nar
rowed down the spread opportunities to a few that are easily recognizable
and easily researchable and I provide some basic information that will take
you far in your spread trading, seasonal or otherwise.
First, there are two ways to trade the spread, long the spread or short
the spread. If you are long the spread the front month is expected to move
up greater in price than the further out month of the market that you may
be trading. If you are short the spread you expect the front month to fall
greater in price than the further out month of the market that you are
trading.

Second, spreads operate in pairs and the difference in the price of a
pair over time is what is being calculated. As the spread pair increases
or decreases in value the joint value of their movement determines their
success. For those new to spread trading it can be shocking when a trade
appears to be successful until the difference between the two spread com
ponents is calculated and you discover that the actual difference between
the two contracts has decreased-which means you are losing money on
a long spread, or increased, which means you are losing money on a short
spread.
Finally, spread trades are affected by supply and demand. Since a
spread trade involves the same type of commodity with contracts spread
out over differing time frames, it is necessary to understand the life cycle
of the commodity that you are spread trading. If it's grains, you have to
understand the planting and harvest seasons; if it's natural gas you have
to know how natural gas is used both in the winter and the summer; or if
it's a currency then you need to know the policies of the central bank that
influences that currency.
Differing supply and demand needs at different times of the year can
have different effects on the contracts being held in the spread. One side of
a spread can end up moving quicker than another. These same contracts, if
you are spreading the futures contracts, can end up not converging with
their underlying asset counterparts. Shortages in crops can also impact
further-out months in a spread pair in unexpected ways. So while non-pair
traded contracts only have the influence of one set of supply and demand
factors a spread pair has to take into account the influences on each con
tract and how those influences relate to one another.
With these three factors in mind four different types of spread
opportunities are explored in this chapter. Professional traders have a
tendency to incorporate anyone, if not all four, of these spread oppor
tunities into their trading programs. What makes these great is that they
are 100 percent accessible to everyday retail traders. No special software
is needed, no fancy mathematical algorithms, no neural networks. Good
old-fashioned price feeds are all you need to get started using these spread
opportunities.
These four different types of spread opportunities- the old crop/new
crop spread, the interest rate yield curve, futures price backwardation, and
price convergence of cash and futures-are all accessible. While I have
focused on only one type of commodity or exchange for each spread op
portunity, keep in mind that all of the ideas are applicable to commodi
ties with a similar profile to that of anyone of these opportunities. What
also makes these contracts exciting is that each one of these spread op
portunities can be quickly spotted on a chart and then be acted upon
quickly.

146 BASIC STRATEGIES
To get the most out of anyone of these different types of spread
trades a solid understanding behind their underlying principles is impor
tant. Knowing the "why" of what is happening is just as important as know
ing the "what to do" when these scenarios arise. All of these spread trad
ing opportunities have been around for quite some time. It's a good idea
to research past examples regarding these four types of spreads on the
Internet or in various books. In fact the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT)
has great tutorials on their web site regarding spread trading grains and
the yield curve. You also have to be willing to demo trade or paper trade
these spread trades before committing capital. If you have robust charting
software, these spreads can be back-tested for their effectiveness. How
ever, your approach to these different spread trading opportunities will
entirely depend on your risk/reward levels and your trading plan. If their
risk/reward levels don't match up with your goals, move on to another set
of risk management tools.
Old Crop/New Crop Spread
The old crop/new crop spread is one of the most well-known spread trades
around. It takes advantage of the difference between the diminishing crop
that has been sitting in storage all year long and the upcoming new harvest
projection. This old crop/new crop spread affects all of the grains to some
degree or another, as well as any product that must be planted and har
vested. The most common old crop/new crop commodities are soybeans,
com, and wheat. These are all grains that can be kept in storage for long
periods. As the year progresses, supplies crisscross the world fulfilling ce
real, material, and feed needs. This dwindling of "old" supplies intersects
with the new year's harvest, creating spread trading opportunities.
A surplus of grains leading into the new year can depress the price of
both the current stocks and the upcoming harvests.
A dwindling supply of grains drives the prices up on the current grain
stores and increases the value of the new harvest grains. Throughout the
year the USDA releases reports on crop plantings and storage levels. The
information that they release directly affects how the old crop/new crop
spread is bought and sold.
One of the most popular grain spread trades is the old crop/new crop
spread for soybeans. The majority of the United States' soybeans are
planted between May and June. These same crops are harvested approx
imately six months later between October and November. This cycle leads
to a sales cycle that runs year round, beginning in September, right before
the new harvest, and ending in August, right after the new plantings.
South America is on a slightly different old crop/new crop spread.
Their planting season operates between April and May, with their harvest

occurring in September-October months. In fact, their cycle is different
enough that the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) created a futures contract
focused solely for the soybeans grown in Brazil.
Depending on which soybean cycle you wish to trade, the United
States' JulylNovember or MaylNovember old crop/new crop spread trade
or South America's ApriVSeptember or MaylNovember, the spread trade is
based on the fundamental activity of the underlying commodities as well
as the technical signals in the charts that can indicate whether or not the
front month should be sold or bought.
The old crop/new crop is also called an intracommodity or intermar
ket spread. Since we are operating with the same commodity but in dif
ferent months it is a lot easier to track, compared to the substitute good
spread known as an intercommodity spread. In later chapters we look at
a few intercommodity spreads based on specific commodities and their
byproducts. The important concept to remember when it comes to the old
crop/new crop spread is that the sum is more important than the parts.
Since the typical soybean intracommodity trade is long the spread,
we are looking for the July contract to increase in value faster than the
November contract. Therefore on a JulylNovember spread we are looking
for the prices to increase in value in relation to one another, a narrow
ing of the spread. Let's say that the difference between JulylNovember is
equal to plus 20 cents. This means that the July contract is 20 cents greater
than the November contract. As long as the difference between the July
and November contracts is plus 20 cents or more, the long spread is intact.
This is known as a 20 cent premium.
The success of the old crop/new crop spread, a seasonal trade, de
pends on one of three occurrences: The July contract's price must con
tinue moving up while the November contract stays the same, or the July
contract's price can move up while the November contract's price moves
down, or the July contract's price can move up while the November con
tract's price moves down simultaneously. With so many possibilities it is
no wonder that this old crop/new crop interrelationship can have a sig
nificant impact on position traders who attempt to roll over an existing
position trade.
If for any reason the July contract's value dips below the November
contract's value, it is known as a discount. The onset of a discount type
of spread scenario can be the beginning of a widening of the spread. For
traders who are long the spread this can be disastrous. As the spread
widens, the July contract drops in value and the November contract in
creases in value. A long spread trader begins to lose money on both sides
of the spread trade. This is the chief danger of any type of spread trading,
but with the old crop/new crop spread trade it can quickly become appar
ent that the spread is not working. Any failure to jump ship immediately

148 BASIC STRATEGIES
from a long spread or to convert a spread position from a long spread to a
short spread can quickly lead to insurmountable losses.
Interest Rate Yield Curve
The interest rate yield curve is a staple of all investing, quite similar to the
old crop/new crop spread in the grains. The concept is simple to trade.
The interest rate yields for bond and note products, with the equivalent
rating but different maturity dates, should be at different levels. The rule of
thumb is that the longer the money is lent out the more interest should be
paid; this is commonly referred to as the "normal yield curve." This normal
yield curve is designed to ensure that the 30 year U.S. Treasury Bond has a
greater yield than the 5-and lO-year Treasury Notes because there is more
risk associated with the length of time.
The interest rate yield curve has a direct impact on how mortgage rates
are set, bank lending practices, and credit cards. The interest rate yield
curve also has a predictive component. A normal yield curve is indicative
of a solid economy and positive growth. Any change in the yield curve away
from normal can portend a significant adjustment in the economy.
The Federal Reserve's policies for the U.S. economy and the U.S.
government's desire for either a weak or strong currency also playa sig
nificant role in what interest yields are being offered to the public. In the
blink of an eye interest rates can move from a normal yield to an inverted
yield; this is when near-term notes command higher interest rates than
long-term bonds. The inverted yield can indicate whether a country's econ
omy is faced with the potential of a recession.
A flat market occurs when short-term interest rates and long-term in
terest rates match up in value. A flat market can be worse than a normal or
inverted yield solely because of the level of uncertainty that it represents.
Either interest rates can cooperate and become normal or there may be
a sudden drop in value with long-term interest rates forcing an inverted
market on the public.
In order to effectively trade the yield curve most traders have one of
two choices. They can actually purchase and sell the associated short-term
notes and long-term bonds or they can trade in the futures markets. If
the yield curve is traded in the futures market then the issues associated
with leveraged trading will also have an impact on how a retail trader ap
proaches this spread opportunity.
Backwardation
Of all of the different types of spread trading this is the most straightfor
ward. When it comes to the pricing of futures contracts the futures price is



==================================================
                     PAGE 163                     
==================================================

Everything in Its Season 149
expected to be greater than the underlying asset. Earlier futures contracts
are also less expensive than later futures contracts. This is known as con
tango. This is a normal byproduct of the carrying charges associated with
futures contracts. The longer a commodity or futures contract is held the
more expensive it becomes.
When supply tightens or demand increases significantly the spot price
or the earlier futures contracts increase in value compared to further
out futures contracts. This price change overrides the normal carrying
charges and puts the market into a state known as backwardation. There
are two spread opportunities that can be initiated when backwardation
occurs.
Both opportunities can be executed but there is an issue of timing in
volved. The window of opportunity is small. If you miss when a market
moves from backwardation to contango and back again, it will be more
difficult to take advantage of these opportunities.
The first spread opportunity requires that you catch a market mov
ing into backwardation immediately. Your charting software should be
programmed to alert you automatically when the front month increases
value above further out months. Once the alert kicks in you can take
advantage of the narrowing of the gap by going long the front month
and selling the further out month; sound fanliliar-old crop/new crop
spread- anyone?
The second spread opportunity involves a market going back to con
tango from backwardation. Once the front month begins to decrease in
value, moving from a backwardation market to a regular contango market,
there is an opportunity to short the front month and buy the further out
month; a widening of the spread.
Unlike the old crop/new crop spread, backwardation is not limited to
the grains. It can occur at any time in any market. Therefore, it is necessary
to scour most, if not all of the tradable markets, in order to catch either
their transition from contango to backwardation or from backwardation to
contango. This is one of the simplest exploitable spreads around, but the
drawback is that it is labor intensive.
The basic rules of spread trading still apply, though. Make sure that the
difference between the front month in a backwardation is at a premium
if you are long the spread, and at a discount if you are short the spread.
Plus your profits still derive themselves from a difference in the contract
prices.
Price Convergence with Cash and Futures
Futures contracts have a set expiration date, on which the price of the
futures contract is meant to converge with the underlying asset or cash

position's price. This convergence ofthe cash price and the futures price i
known as the narrowing of the basis.
For those entities that use futures contracts to hedge their cash pc
sition this narrowing of the basis is essential. If a farmer grows soybean
he hopes that the cash price will continue upward while the short future
contract is simply a hedge, a protective position designed to lose moneJ
A soybean processor that wants to protect himself from prices moving ur
ward will buy a futures soybean contract, while still hoping that prices wil
drop. If the price moves up they will gain it back in the futures market; i
the price gets weaker they are ready to lose money in the long futures pc
sition so that they can make cheaper purchases in the cash market. Botl
types of hedgers really have nothing to lQse as the futures price gets close
to the cash value.
For retail traders this experience can be duplicated by playing th
convergence of the spot currency market with the futures currenc:
markets. For example, by following the 50-day MA you can determine th
currency market's trend or counter-trend. Once the trend is determine4
the spot market can operate as the primary position and the futures Cal
operate as the hedge, with the goal of holding on to the position until the:
reach the same price.
There is a drawback to playing a convergence spread, though. I1
2008 the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's Agricultural Commit
tee had an emergency meeting regarding the convergence of grain fu
tures and their cash counterparts. Apparently, for several years the effect
of carrying charges and speculation were so severe that even at expira
tion the futures grain prices were not matching up with the cash price~
This blatant discrepancy effectively ruined the cash grain market's abil
ity to instill confidence in the commodity exchange mechanism of priC4
discovery.
This problem, while currently concentrated in the grain markets, ma;
portend the future of all commodities exchanges around the world. A sig
nificant number of money managers have been putting investors into fu
tures contracts because of global inflation in the value of raw materials
This is a new phenomenon. Add to this new phenomenon the fact that;
number of new exchanges are starting up mirror commodity contracts i1
order to siphon off liquidity from major exchanges around the world an<
you have a recipe for price discovery disaster occurring.
The nwnber of hedgers out there is finite. All of the exchanges com
pete with each other for a limited number of hedgers looking to protec
themselves, while speculators flood contracts with cash as they look fo
new opportunities to profit from worldwide demands. There is little doub
that the convergence spread between futures and the cash market day!
are numbered.

CONCLUSION
Spread trading is not perfect. On one hand, you have the opportunity to
profit. On the other, you could end up with one successful side that doesn't
really cover the losing side, or with two losing sides. Spread trades are
also difficult to unwind. While your margin is inexpensive when the spread
trade is on, if you try to unwind the spread you are immediately hit with
new margin requirements. Finally, many ofthe traditional seasonal spreads
are simply too well known to be as effective as they may have been years
ago. Still, with all of these imperfections spread trading makes for a more
than decent risk management strategy.
When done right spread trading allows a trader to take advantage of ar
bitrage opportunities. Those are the small discrepancies in price that spec
ulators thrive on financially. Spread trading can reduce the most expensive
markets to reasonable margins. Plus, spread trading transcends exchanges
or trading vehicles. The spot price can be spread with the futures price. Dif
ferent futures months can be spread against each other and options can be
spread in any number of ways. Spread trading is simply one of the most ver
satile ways to trade for a trader of any skill level. The majority of the prob
lems with spread trades can be resolved quite easily. As long as a spread
trade is either backed up by another risk management strategy or there
are stop limits in place to protect a spread trade from going terribly wrong
there is no reason to fear this exciting risk management technique.

Gunning for
Premiums with
Covered Options
M any of the risk management strategies that have been explored
throughout the book have involved some form of option. Whether
it be a strangle strategy, a synthetic futures, or an option as a stop
purchasing, options have played an integral role in helping to manage the
risk associated with a core futures or spot position. Depending on the mar
ket and type of option this can mean thousands of dollars tied up in option
premiums, with the realistic expectation that part or all of the premium
could be lost. This chapter is designed to help you change gears. For once
the option premium can actually come to you.
The premium generated from option selling is real money that can add
to any trader's bottom line. The difficulty comes in being able to decide
which option to sell and how to sell it in the same protected way that you
use for any of the other risk management strategies in the book. As we have
learned time and time again, options are inherently different from futures
and spot transactions. Successfully navigating those differences can help
any trader generate a consistent cash flow from option premiums.
It was difficult to make the decision to include a chapter on option
selling in a book primarily focused on futures, spot, and cash markets. Yet,
in the end no book that is designed to manage risk can truly discriminate
against one of the most touted limited risk trading strategies around, sell
ing options. Major Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs) have made a name
for themselves by solely selling options. Their strategies range from selling
options that are about to expire to devising option strategies that exploit
volatility or the lack thereof in stock indexes. Yet some flaws and misin
formation accompany option selling. Many of these flaws can be overcome

with the proper approach, but unfortunately the misinformation has to be
attacked head-on.
PROBLEMS WITH SELLING OPTIONS
Option selling should be a straightforward endeavor. See an option you
want to sell, sell it, wait until expiration, and collect the premium. You
would think that it was as easy as pie, but for some reason it isn't. There are
margin requirements along with inherent flaws in the structure of options
that make the prospect of selling them dif!icult. Couple these problems
with the claims that 70 percent to 80 percent of options are worthless when
they expire and it's no wonder that the average trader who ventures into
selling options quickly finds himself in over his head.
Margin Requirements
While selling options should be a simple, if not easy, proposition, somehow
selling options does not live up to the hype. In fact, while promoters tout
the benefits of selling options and the easy money to be had, the truth is
a lot less glamorous. Selling options is actually considered just as risky, if
not more so, than buying options.
Technically the structure of an option does not favor option sellers.
Once an option is sold it exposes the seller to unlimited risk. At the same
time it only offers the option seller the meager profit that the premium has
to offer. This unlimited exposure has led clearing firms in the futures mar
ket to require that option sellers have enough capital to protect themselves
in case the market moves against them. Amounts may vary from clearing
firm to clearing firm, but as a standard rule they will require the same mar
gin amount as if you had initiated a futures contract.
For example, if you sold an option on a full-size S&P 500 contract, you
would be able to collect $5,000 in premiums, but you would be required
to put up $22,000 in margin for the privilege. So, even though it is assumed
that selling options is superior to buying them, the simple fact that they can
be so cost prohibitive leads traders to avoid them.
What about the collected premium?
The $5,000 in premium is treated like any futures or options position.
Options are traded marked to market. If the volatility is on your side they
will increase in value, if the volatility is against you they will decrease in
value. The only time that the premium is actually considered yours by the
clearing firms is when the option has expired and the trader is no longer

==================================================

Cunning for Premiums with Covered Options 155
exposed to unlimited risk. Until then the premium is not counted as part of
your overall count value.
Poor Returns
The requirement that traders put up margin when they sell options also
leads to what can be perceived as poor returns in comparison to the risk in
volved. If a trader has to expose $22,000 in margin in order to make $5,000,
knowing full well that he could lose the entire $22,000 and possibly more
if he's wrong, then it most likely is not the best possible bet to take. Add to
this the fact that, depending on when the option expires, the trader's cap
ital can be tied up for months at a time, which can make option selling a
discouraging endeavor for small traders.
If you are a small trader and you only have a $5,000 account your op
portunities to sell options decrease even more. You would be lucky if you
could comfortably sell an option worth $500, or 10 percent of your account
value. This $500 income would not change the average retail trader's life.
For an account of this size there may only be four or five successful op
portunities every year. If you are lucky and have no losses you could net
$2,000 to $2,500 annually.
This definitely does not coincide with the one for two rule discussed
in previous chapters. In fact, it's inverted risk-risk two to gain one.
In addition, the possible annual returns look dismal, ranging from 40 to
50 percent, which is not what the average trader signs up for. This negative
feeling toward such returns may not be warranted, though. A return of 40
to 50 percent a year exceeds the historical returns of the S&P 500, while at
the same time beating out any bond, junk or otherwise. Even if the option
selling strategy works out twice a year, producing $1,000 in premium based
on this scenario, a 20 percent return would still exceed the stock market's
past returns.
It goes without saying that eTAs that trade an option selling strategy
benefit from a different financial scale than does the average retail trader.
Small profits for a eTA accumulated over time turn out to be great gains.
For a larger entity, 20 percent on $50 million yields a $10 million return.
This kind of profit would put a eTA among some the top traders in the
world.
The unglamorous nature of option selling leads retail traders to mis
understand the performance. There is no comparison between collecting
option premiums and aggressively catching moves in the market. One is a
passive action and the other is proactive. Therefore, selling options should
not be put in the same category as buying options or obtaining a cash or
spot position.

156 BASIC STRATEGIES
Percentage of Options that Expire Worthless
The perpetual myth is that 80 to 90 percent of options expire worthless. If
this is the case, selling options should be like shooting fish in a barrel. Yet
something is amiss. Not every trader, professional or retail, sells options.
In fact, option selling is considered a specialized field that only a few select
traders focus on. This simple fact gives a true glimpse into the nature of
selling options, their difficulty, and the reality of the number of contracts
that do actually expire worthless. In Chapter 14 we take a more advanced
approach to selling options and further break down the option expiration
myth.
COVERED OPTION TRADING
Selling options has problems-margin requirements, poor returns, and ex
piration issues-yet this can still be an effective way to generate income
and increase returns when done correctly. All of the problems are tied to
selling options by themselves, or naked. When an option is sold naked there
is no counter side to limit the unlimited risk that it has. The secret, like ev
ery other risk management strategy in this book, is to couple the selling
of an option with another strategy designed, intentionally or unintention
ally, to protect the trader from any erratic moves. This is known as covered
option trading.
Without question selling options can have a positive affect on a trader's
account. It is a simple income-producing trading strategy that can power
boost any trader's returns. To make it a successful enterprise, a trader is
required to do two things-control his profit expectations and increase the
vigilance over his trading. Then it becomes a simple endeavor to implement
the strategies in this chapter.
Traditionally a covered option is the combination of an option and a
futures or cash position. The option is sold against the futures or cash po
sition to generate income. Yet there are many different ways to cover an
option. Options can be staggered with multiple strike prices or they can be
tied to other risk management strategies such as Collars or Synthetic Op
tions. However selling covered options is approached, it diminishes if not
eliminates many of the problems that selling naked options can have.
Selling Options against Futures or Cash Position
The simplest approach to implementing a covered option position involves
the combination of a cash position with an option. The crux of the idea is



==================================================
                     PAGE 171                     
==================================================

Gunning for Premiums with Covered Options 157
that when a stock's shares flatten out or get weaker in price call options
can be sold to generate income.
If the stock's price goes down the trader gains the premium, which
diminishes his losses in the shares. If the price goes up the stock trader has
one of two choices-buy back the option at a higher premium or give up
any gains in his shares above and beyond the option strike price. The same
scenario can be played out for the futures, forex, or CFD markets.
Initiating a Covered Position Few decisions have to be made when
it comes to trading covered positions in the stock market. Those people
who buy stocks are automatically long-side specialists who therefore un
derstand that they will only be selling calls. Also since there is no leverage
on the stock itself it is simpler to purchase one stock option for every 100
shares of stock owned. Finally, since the option is sold as a secondary po
sition to the actual stock shares the option strike price is not given much
thought.
The ease with which covered option positions can be implemented in
the stock market gives us a contrast to the difficulty that can be associated
with the futures and forex markets. When it comes to putting on covered
option positions in the futures market, unlike stocks, there are too many
choices. Since longs and shorts are treated equally in the futures market
covered positions can be implemented with puts or calls. Delta also has
a larger impact on the option selling decision. The less the delta is, the
more likely multiple options at the same strike price will be sold in order
to match the movement of the underlying asset.
Finally, in a covered position the sold option may actually be the pri
mary position with the futures or spot contract acting as the protective
position. This makes the option strike price more important based on how
much premium can be collected.
The spot forex market has one flaw that the futures market doesn't
have-lack of a true option market. Spot forex options tend to be cus
tomized contracts between the traders and the deal makers. This makes for
liquidity issues and can limit the strike prices that deal makers are willing
to work with. In the end, since there is no centralized exchange in the spot
forex market, it is difficult for spot options to be both fairly priced and liq
uid enough to be realistically used in a covered option scenario. This does
not mean, though, that you can't cross trade with forex futures options to
create the exact same trades.
In this section we look at two different ways to initiate a covered op
tion position. One is an aggressive way to put on a covered position. This
action, when all of the indicators are pointing one way and a covered op
tion is intentionally initiated in the opposite direction, is known as fading
the market. The second way to initiate a covered option is when a position

has already gained a profit and is stalling out. In fact, if done properly it can
actually give the winning position a way to weather temporary pullbacks
or retracements.
Rules for Worldng with Covered Options To make covered options
work a strict approach must be taken. First, make sure you are a trend or
counter-trend trader, long side or short side specialist. This specialization
is paramount to having a consistent approach when selling options. In the
stock market you are forced to be a trend specialist, but in futures or spot
forex you can be either a trend or a counter-trend specialist. Choosing a
side helps dictate how comfortable you will be with your option selling
decisions and how you will react to the market's moves.
Second, the delta can play an important role in the number of options
you will want to sell. If the option's delta is moving at one third of the
underlying contract's actual price it makes sense to sell three options, not
one, in order to gain the full benefit of protective option. This can backfire
if the delta and volatility gets closer to the value of the underlying asset
while at the same time prices are moving against you.
Third, you must make a decision regarding what type of option will be
sold. While three types of options are available-out-of-the-money, in-the
money CITM) , and at-the-money CATM)-only two, ITM and ATM, are of
importance to futures and forex option sellers. Stock traders want to hold
on to their stock position, but futures and forex are happy to collect as
much premium as possible while totally disregarding the underlying posi
tion. This can best be accomplished with an ITM option, but if the trader
has a conservative streak then selling an ATM option may be a better bet.
Finally, there is an issue of timing. There are no rules set in stone re
quiring that a sold option must be held until expiration. If a profit is evident,
then the option can be bought back ahead of time. This requires the option
seller to have a set goal on his profit targets and to stay in control of the
maximum loss on his underlying futures or forex position.
Examples of Fading the llfarket The following are two examples of
a market setup that is perfect for selling an option. The prices are sitting
around the 50-day MA and to the naked eye the market could go either up
or down. Based on the technical analysis it can clearly be seen that the
market will be going long or short. Then the covered option is put in place
to fade the actual direction of where the market is predicted to go.
Fading the market means that if the market signals suggest that the
market will move up in value, long, you initiate a covered put position to
collect the premium. If the market signals suggest that the market will drop
in value, short, you initiate a covered call position to collect the premium.

This allows the trader to put on in-the-money trades and collect a signifi
cant premium in the process.
Long Market, Covered Put Position Crude oil's price in Figure 10.1 is
$85.40 and there is support sitting at $84.25. That means there is at least
$1.15 difference before the market may stop moving downward and decide
to tum around. With that in mind you can sit on the sidelines before initi
ating a covered put trade. You are looking to put the odds in your favor.
If the market breaks through support then you can initiate a covered call
strategy.
In Figure 10.2 the market hits the $84.25 support line and bounces back
around, stopping beneath the 50-day MA. As we know from Winning the
Trading Game, the 50-day MA plays a significant role in determining a mar
ket's direction. If it can successfully break through the 50-day MA, a new
long market will be initiated; if it hits the 50-day MA and collapses, it will
continue its bearish trend aggressively.
With all of the momentum on the bullish side, this is the perfect setup
to put on a covered put. You want to make sure you collect the premium
with few or no problems. So as it gets close to the 50-day MA it makes sense
to sell a put, with the hope it will break through the 50-day MA and start

a new bullish trend. Just in case the market drops in value you execute a
short position, to cover the sold put.
In Table 10.1 several strike prices are compared to the premiums that
can be collected. Since the market in Figure 10.2 has an overall bearish
bias it makes sense that the put options with a higher strike price are more
expensive than the premiums that are closer to the money.
In Figure 10.3 the price breaks above the 50-day MA and stays above it
for 2 or 3 days. This is a significant clue to whether this is a false breakout
or there has been a fundamental shift in the supply and demand of the
commodity. It also signals you to exit your short position and stop eroding
the premium you have collected.

In this instance you enter your short position at $90 and exit your short
position at $91.15 for a total loss of $1,115. This is subtracted directly from
the premium you collected depending on the strike price you sold.
There are a few things to keep in mind when you unwind your posi
tion. First, once you get out of the protective short you will need to put a
stop on the sold call in order avoid losing the premium you have already
made. Second, you will immediately lose the special margin rate you were
receiving; therefore you will need to have enough margin in the account to
maintain the position. Finally, you need to be sure that you are willing to
exit the trade without carrying it all the way until expiration. At some point
you will be risking too much premium compared to what you will earn if
you hold the position until expiration, so keep the rule of risking one to
gain two in mind.
Short Market, Covered Long Position In the covered long position we take
a look at the com market. In Figure 10.4 we can see that the com market
has built up a lot of bullish momentum. It has filled at $4.60 and is heading
straight for the resistance at $4.90. Again, we are looking for a setup to
occur. If com breaks $4.90 it can get as high as $5.20.
In Figure 10.5 we see the com market slow down and reverse at the
$4.90 price. At the time the com $4.90 options are worth $1,400. If you sell

a call option at that price a premium of $1,400 can be collected. A long
position is put into play to cover the position in case the market breaks
through $4.90. This is a preemptive move. Unlike the previous example,
the market has proven itself for several down days. The only reason it is
worthwhile to take a chance on it is because of gravity. Markets have a
tendency to fall faster than they can move up. So as a rule I have a tendency
to be more adventurous when taking signals for the short side as opposed
to the long side (see Table 10.2).
In Figure 10.6 everything is against com. The price is collapsing off
the upper Bollinger band, RSI is overbought, and the price gaps down the
next day. The long position cannot be exited fast enough. In fact, slippage
would most likely end up giving back half of your collected premium. But
that's okay-you have the protected position to ensure you don't expose

yourself to unlimited losses. If the market had shot up your position would
have been naked. This is the trade-off of having a protective position.
E ..h a. . ci. .g the Profits of a Wi ....i ..g Positio.. Another type of cov
ered option position can come after holding onto a successful position for
some time. If a position trade has been placed on and has become suc
cessful, for instance if a long spot forex has racked up decent returns, but
suddenly stalls out, there is an opportunity to sell a call option to generate
income from the successful position. As soon as the market returns to the
direction of the winning trade the sold call is immediately offset, hopefully
with a small profit or at least at break-even. This strategy works just as
easily for traders who are in a successful short trade.
In Figure 10.7 a trader has entered the S&P 500 on a 50-day MA
crossover. As the market moves up for a significant gain the S&P 500 slows
its move upward at 1560 and the market begins to move sideways. This is
a definite bearish signal after such a long move upward.
There is an opportunity to sell a call at these heights and generate a
significant income. An at-the-money full-size option can easily command
thousands in premium. Therefore you can have the best of both worlds; you
can protect your trade from any temporary pullback with money collected

the position is a covered option sale.
In Figure 10.8 we see the S&P 500 drop in value and come back to the
50-day MA. At that time the long position and the sold call should be exited.
Profits should be set aside and a reassessment of the trade should be made
to determine what the new direction could be.
1\\'0 Advanced Covered Option Strategies
In Chapter 7 and Chapter 8 we looked at two different strategies that in
volved options, collars, and synthetic options. In each instance we used a
protective option to protect the cash, futures, or stock position. The protec
tive option was put in place to protect against any sudden drops or jumps,
but with a little more imagination an option can be sold on either type of
position to generate income to add to the overall profit of the position.
Selling an Option against a Synthetic Option This strategy is
slightly advanced because there are three moving parts, but it is another
way to initiate a covered option position, and thus it's important to ex
pose you to the idea. As we learned in Chapter 8, a synthetic option is the
combination of an at-the-money option and a futures, spot, or cash market.

==================================================

166 BASIC STRATEGIES
Whether you go long or short, the protective option is purchased to protect
against any risk of loss.
There is no set rule that the position the option is covering has to solely
be the futures, spot, or cash position. In fact another option can be added
to the mix. An option can be sold out-of-the-money, a few points away from
the synthetic's protective option. If the position is working in favor of the
underlying asset, then the extra premium is added to your overall profits. If
the position fails, the protective option covers any price move that may oc
cur in the sold option. You give up the profits from any market move against
your position, but at the same time you have a way to capitalize on your
protective option or at the very least have a way to pay for part or all of it.
Let's take a market example from Chapter 8.
In Figure 10.9 we see the market rally through the 50-day MA. A put
was purchased at $930. The option cost $1,830. It would take little effort
to sell a put at $925 or at $935, if you're aggressive. A sold option at either
strike price will produce enough premium to either match or cover the cost
of the purchased option.
Selling an Option against a Collar In Chapter 7 we attacked the col
lar trade. By now you may have figured out that the very nature of a collar
is based on the covered option concept and the synthetic option combined.
Even though the sold option is a far out-of-the-money option, once the

underlying asset breaks through the strike price it immediately turns into
a covered position.
But the fact that a synthetic option is the core component of a collar
means that an option can be sold out of the money against the purchased
option to produce a little extra income as well.
CONCLUSION
Selling options can be a complex proposition. Myths, like the belief that 80
to 90 percent of options expire worthless, do more harm than good when
making an informed decision to sell options. Add to that the impact that
margin rules have on the ability to sell options, plus the effects that volatil
ity has on choosing the right option to sell, and it's easy to see that in the
wrong hands option selling can be disastrous.
Selling options requires a healthy dose of respect and discipline. Once
it is accepted that the option has the potential for unlimited losses, the
proper measures can be taken to minimize or eliminate that loss. Proper
measures can mean selling an option against a futures or spot position,
tying a sold option to the tail of a synthetic option, or being aggressive with
a straddle or strangle position. As long as a trader is willing to step out of
the box when it comes to selling options, its liabilities can become assets
over time.
As with all of the strategies presented in this book, the goal is to put
you in control of how you interact with the market. Whether that means
combining various tools so the odds are in your favor or avoiding this strat
egy altogether, then so be it. Whatever will make you ultimately feel com
fortable with selling options is exactly how you should employ them in
your trading. This strategy is solely a means to an end-increased profits
coupled with diminished risk. If you fail to see an opportunity, don't force
it. Just let it flow.

Outflanldng
the Market
I n Chapter 9 spread trading was explained in detail for futures contracts
and the cash market. In this chapter spread trading is being explored
once again, but from an option perspective. There are many different
types of option spreads, from iron condors to horizontal spreads to vertical
spreads, along with a myriad of other exotically named spreads. Many of
these are outside the scope of this book, either because they are too exotic
or because they cannot be easily tied back into a futures or cash position.
In no way does that mean that they are inferior, and in fact you can benefit
from learning how they work.
For the purposes of this book, the most effective option spread for
our dual goals of minimizing losses and maximizing profits is a very spe
cific ratio spread. The overall definition of the ratio spread requires that an
unequal number of long and short positions be held. There can be a mul
titude of ways to execute this strategy. In one scenario a ratio spread can,
if done properly, limit the overall risk of a trader through simultaneously
diminishing losses and practically setting up a free trading opportunity. In
another scenario of the ratio spread, things can be exactly the opposite.
This type of ratio spread can expose a trader to unlimited losses if the mar
ket moves aggressively. In fact, being on the wrong side ofthis type of ratio
spread can ruin all but the most astute trader's account.
Distinguishing between these ratio spreads is just the tip of the iceberg
when it comes to trading the ratio spreads. There is the matter of being able
to select the proper ratio based on the underlying asset's market direction,
and there is the question of whether the ratio between longs and shorts
should relate to price or delta or both. Regardless of how the ratio spread

is implemented, it is a simple way for a trader to participate in various
market moves without having to risk too much of his own capital, which
can be important if you are trading with tight capital constraints.
FRONTSPREADS AND BACKSPREADS
Since a ratio spread is simply the act of holding an unequal number of long
and short positions, two different permutations of this scenario can occur.
Either you can buy one call or put and sell two calls or puts (known as
a frontspread) or you can sell one call or -put and buy two calls or puts
(known as a backspread).
Frontspl'eads
Let's look at the frontspread first. The frontspread is typically considered
the default ratio spread. It simply requires that an option be purchased at a
set price, preferably out-of-the-money, and two options be sold at a slightly
higher strike price. The goal is to profit from the difference between the
option strike prices. The trade is designed as a way to exploit a decrease in
option volatility. It is assumed that with less volatility the options are less
likely to move, and the premiums, along with the call's profit gains between
strike prices, are assured.
The downside of the frontspread is self-evident, though. As highlighted
earlier, there is an inherent flaw when it comes to selling options. When an
option is sold the trader is subject to the potential of unlimited losses. This
means that when a frontspread ratio spread is initiated the trader is at an
automatic disadvantage. If the underlying asset takes off in price and the
option volatility increases, then the sold options will gain in value quickly.
While there is one purchased option covering the increase in value of one
sold option, the second option is uncovered and thus exposes the trader to
unlinlited loss potential.
For example, a trader may purchase a gold put for $950 and then sell
two gold puts at $940. There is an apparent belief that there is a window
of trading opportunity between $950 to $940, or $1,000 in profits. The two
sold options, particularly at this close strike price range, produce enough
premium to pay for most if not all of the bought gold put.
The primary drawback would be if the price of gold drops past $940,
then the unlimited risk of one of the sold options kicks in. The secondary
drawback is if the price actually moves in the opposite direction. In this
example if gold moves from $950 to $960 the purchased option begins to

.7.
Outflanking the Market
lose value. At that time the hope is that premium collected from selling
$940 puts will cover the losses and help the trade to break even.
For a more advanced trader who has a thorough understanding of
option volatility and has the ability to juggle the risk of multiple positions,
this type of ratio spread may be just the ticket. For those traders who are
a little more conservative with both their capital and their time, a second
type of ratio spread exists: the backspread.
Backspreads
The backspread is so powerful that it has the ability, depending on the mar
ket's volatility, to give you 360-degree protection from risk. At the outset
the backspread ratio spread is designed to manage the risk. Instead of buy
ing the at-the-money call and paying a significant premium, the backspread
requires that you sell the more expensive option and use that premium to
purchase two slightly out-of-the-money options. Instead of dreading any
market move, the backspread thrives on the volatility.
If the market moves aggressively in the direction of the backspread,
bullish or bearish, the purchased options create the opportunity for unlim
ited gains. While the frontspread is exposed to unlimited risk by the one
uncovered option, this setup is inverted in the backspread. The original
sold call is covered by one of the purchased options. The second option is
where all of the profits accumulate. This is liberating.
Add the fact that the backspread trade protects itself from accumu
lating losses by setting up a break-even scenario between the sold option
and the two bought options, and the backspread ratio spread beats out the
frontspread any day. The worst loss that can occur is the premium paid
for the bought options, and most of that can be made up by the premium
collected by the sold option.
For example, if the technical analysis is pointing to the oil market mov
ing up in price, but the high cost of the margin (as of this writing $10,000
per contract) drives you away, a backspread ratio spread has the ability to
get you in. You sell a call option at a strike price of $145 per barrel and col
lect a premium of $6,000. You then purchase two out-of-the-money options
with a strike price of $150 per barrel for a total of $7,000 in premium. Your
net expense is $1,000, plus the clearing firm runs the SPAN risk manage
ment software program and reduces or eliminates any margin requirement
for the sold option.
If the market moves in the direction of the purchased call options at
$150 per barrel, then the risk between $145 per barrel and $150 per barrel
equals $5,000. At the same time the options are increasing in value because
of increased volatility as the underlying asset moves closer to the strike

                     PAGE 186                     
==================================================

172 BASIC STRATEGIES
price. Once the underlying asset breaks through the $150 strike price, the
premium increases rapidly.
If the market were to hit $160 per barrel, then gross proceeds would
be $20,000. However, $10,000 would have to be subtracted to cover the
increase in the premium of the sold $145 call. An additional $5,000 would
have to be subtracted as well, the difference between the two strike prices.
This leaves a net profit of $5,000, give or take a few dollars due to slippage.
This is not a bad return for a $1,000 investment, 1 for 5.
What happens if the market moves against the position? Let's say it
falls from $145 per barrel to $135 per barrel. The collected premium of
$6,000 begins to erode in value at the same time that the options you bought
at $150 decrease in value. Even if both of the options lose their entire pre
mium, the net expense to execute the trade~ is $1,000. This is in sharp con
trast to the futures oil margin of $10,000- practically a tenfold increase in
the leverage without the tenfold increase in risk.
In a one-for-one comparison, the frontspread has just as many vari
ables as a backspread, but its unlimited risk makes the frontspread an in
ferior trade to the backspread. Yet they both are trades that suffer from
the one-trick pony syndrome. While selling a call is a way to have a bear
ish bias in the market or selling a put is a way to have a bullish bias in the
market, they are both passive ways to be involved in a trade. This in effect
can cut your returns in half if the market dictates that you have to reverse
your position quickly.
TRADING BACKSPREADS
The core benefit of trading a backspread ratio spread is the ability to use
the market's money to trade. There are few times when the market actu
ally works on your behalf to help you succeed, but this is one of those
times. Throughout the book we have looked at the favoritism given to
hedge traders and commercial traders for daisy-chaining multiple positions
together; there is no better place where this is exemplified than in the back
spread ratio spread. Selling an option and buying two options provides a
sincere opportunity to trade practically for free. It is therefore important to
discern how many options should be bought, whether price or delta should
be the guide, and when a call or a put should be sold to establish the begin
nings of a backspread trade.
Price versus Delta
Thus far we have talked about the ratio spread as if there is a specific num
ber of options sold versus options bought, in this case two. The reality is

                     PAGE 187                     
==================================================

Outflanking the Market 173
that for every option sold you can determine the number of options pur
chased in any fashion. Some have strictly adhered to the price difference
between the bought and sold options, whereas others have used delta as a
guide to optimizing how many contracts to initiate.
Price If price is used as the litmus test of what options to buy and
sell, then the premium collected should represent no less than 50 per
cent of the total value of the options purchased. This goes back to our
one-for-two money management trading rule. If the price of the sold op
tion is less than 50 percent of the value of the bought options, then the
question that has to be asked is, "Can I use a less exposing risk manage
ment tool to achieve the same results?" The answer is most likely yes.
Regardless of whether the sold option is being covered by a bought op
tion, the less capital you commit to the trade, the more profitable the
trade will be for you in the long run. Ideally you would like the sold op
tion to cover the cost of both of the bought options, but this can be a
difficult task.
There are trade-offs when attempting to make a backspread ratio
spread entirely free; they involve the strike price. The closer an option
strike price is to the underlying asset price, the more expensive that op
tion's premium is. When the goal is to collect premiums, at-the-money or
in-the-money options are great. Unfortunately, the inverse is also true: The
closer you buy options to the underlying asset's fair market value, the more
you will spend.
So when it comes to trading the ratio spread, the further out that the
strike price is for the bought options, the more likely you will be able to use
the premium collected to pay for most or all of them. Yet at the same time
the further out that the bought option strike price is from the sold option,
the greater the loss difference before the positive effects of the bought
options can kick in.
In our oil example earlier, we sold an option at $145 and bought two
options with a strike price of $150. The difference between $145 and $150,
$5, equates to a built-in loss between the prices of $5,000. If the strike price
for the purchased options were to be stretched out to $155 per barrel, the
loss gap would extend from $5,000 to $10,000. This would mean that more
patience would be required on the part of the trader, more volatility would
be necessary on the part of the option, and the opportunity costs would
simply have a disastrous effect on any trader who was right about the mar
ket's direction but had used two strike prices that were simply too far out
to take advantage of a move.
Therefore, when an option's premium is used to determine the buying
of a covered position, it is essential that the difference in strike prices plays
a role in the decision-making process for a ratio spread.

==================================================

174 BASIC STRATEGIES
Delta Delta is a little trickier than choosing a strike price or collecting
and comparing premiums. Delta measures how closely an option's change
in price mirrors the change in its underlying asset. If the delta is .S, that
means that it moves SO cents for every one-dollar move in the underlying
asset. This also means that your ratio of sold options to bought options
can have multiple permutations. You could buy two options with a delta
of .4 or you could buy four options with a delta of .2. This is known as a
delta-neutral strategy.
This significantly changes the trader's dependence on the strike price.
If the delta of the underlying sold option is fiat or slightly increasing in
value while the bought options are rapidly increasing, then the trade is
succeeding.
For instance, if the sold option has a delta of .6 and the purchased op
tions have a delta of .3, then any change in delta value ofthe bought option
enhances the ratio trade. Let's say the market moves in the same direc
tion as the purchased options, the sold call moves deeper into the money,
and the delta shifts from .6 to .S. At the same time, the purchased options
shift from a delta of .3 to .6 each. This is a very bullish sign. Where once
before there was a one-to-one ratio regardless of the number of options,
now the ratio has moved in favor of the bought options, making it .S to 1.2
(a 2:3 ratio), and climbing.
In this breakdown we are looking purely at price in relation to the un
derlying asset. In this way we can assess whether we can exit a trade with
a profit, regardless of whether it has actually reached the underlying strike
price. Of course there is no hard-and-fast rule when it comes to using the
delta. This is simply a tool to help you play with the ratio spread and adds
another dimension to help you succeed in your trading.
Bullish Backspread
The bullish backspread is also known as a call ratio backspread. This is
the strategy that is used if a trader wants to catch the long momentum of a
market. The call ratio backspread consists of two components: the sale of
calls and the purchase of a greater number of calls at a higher strike price.
This strategy has the exact same profile as a standard call option: limited
downside risk and unlimited profit potential. If this strategy is established
at a credit, the trader stands to make a small gain if the price of the under
lying asset decreases dramatically.
Let's take a look at how a call ratio backspread would be executed in
the com market (see Figure 11.1).
The September com futures price is $5.74 per bushel after dropping
from a high of $6.20 per bushel. The price is sitting on the 50-day MA with
one of two scenarios presenting itself. Either the market will bounce off

the 50-day MA and resume its up trend or it will break through the 50-day
MA and make a fundamental shift in becoming a bearish market.
With the bias being on the upside for as long as it has been for this
chart, two months, putting on a bullish backspread is not unreasonable.
Based on Table 11.1, a bullish backspread could work based on our 50
percent or greater criterion.
The 570 call commands a premium of 28'2 and the 580 call commands
a premium of 22'2. If you are willing to be 30 cents out-of-the-money, you
can get a 605 call for 14'6. This would definitely be a two-for-one scenario,
but in the process you would be exposing yourself to a loss of $1,500 (30
cents times $50/cent) before you could make any money.
By selling the 570 call and purchasing two 580 calls, the maximum
amount of loss you are exposIng yourself to between the two strike prices

is $500. At the same time the 570 option has an additional 5 cents left over
after paying for its covered option. This means that the second call op
tion effectively cost just 18'3, making the cost of the 580 premium less
than that of a 590 option, 19'4. There is a $500 difference between the
two strike prices, which you get to collect if the market moves in your
direction.
As shown in Figure 11.2, the price of com drops briefly below the
50-day MA before turning around and resuming its upward trend. Each
of the bought calls grosses $1,800 in profits for a total of $3,600. The net
proceeds to the trader come out to around $1,300.
Bearish Backspread
On the opposite side the bullish backspread is the bearish backspread, also
known as the put ratio backspread. Everything is done the exact same way
as in a bullish backspread, but instead options are bought and sold to take
advantage of the drop in prices.
Let's rewind the com contract to a time before it dropped down toward
the 50-day MA.
In Figure 11.3 the price has stalled out at around 620. Significant hor
izontal resistance has developed around this price. This is definitely an
indicator that the market has the potential to pull back at least to the

50-day MA. A drop from 620 to 570 is a potential gross profit of $2,500
(50 cents x $50/cent).
In Table 11.2 the premium received from a 620 put is 32 cents. By
selling one 620 put and buying two 610 puts, the effective cost of the profit
making put is just 18'1, almost the same price as the 590 put, which is 20
cents away or $1,000.
In Figure 11.4 the price of com drops, and it grosses the trader $2,775
for each sold put because it gaps below the 50-day MA. The net profit for
the trader is $2,275. In order to arrive at the figure, we have to take the
$2,775 and subtract $500, which is the difference between the 620 and 610
strike prices.

Weaknesses of the Bullish and
Bearish Backspreads
The bullish and bearish backspreads are highly effective strategies if you
have both the time and the capital. Yet there are some key weaknesses that
can't be overlooked. First is the cost of the bought options versus the pre
mium collected. If you hope to not be caught off guard by a huge difference
in the strike prices, you will be paying top dollar for the close-to-the-money
options. As we have seen, this can playa significant role in how much of
a discount can truly be applied to the bought options from the sale of an
option. The premium can be used to acquire more options the further out
of-the-money their strike prices are, but that also means more missed profit
opportunity.
A second problem is the one-sided emphasis on the market's direction.
When you are bullish or bearish, that is your market bias. In our examples
the market behaved, but what if it doesn't? Then the premium you paid for
the second option is fully at risk. Another risk management strategy would
need to be implemented to protect the option that is meant to make you a
profit.
Finally, if the market moves but not significantly enough to gain a
profit, the option seller is still on the hook to give back the premium, plus
any gains due to the purchaser. So while our idealized scenarios showed
the market dropping or moving up significantly, what would happen if it

moved only halfway or a quarter of the way? Those near successes would
be as bad as a complete failure in some instances.
CONCLUSION
Ratio spreads are an exciting way to get the market to pay for part if not
all of your trading activity, but they come with some significant pitfalls
and risks. Whether you trade frontspreads or backspreads, there are no
surefire ways to guarantee that you won't be exposed to losing something.
The question that needs to be answered is, "Is the risk worth it?" That can
only be determined by the level of faith you have in your technical and
fundamental analysis. How well you pick market direction and set profit
targets will directly impact whether ratio spread trading can work for you.

Advanced Strategies
I n this section we look at six advanced risk management strategies.
While some basic strategies were mentioned briefly in Winning the
Trading Game, these strategies are altogether brand-new. We ex
plore synthetic futures, selling straddles, selling strangles, intercommodity
spread, naked option selling, and bull/bear call spreads. These strategies,
while having some risk management components associated with them,
also provide more exposure to the unlimited risk aspect of selling options.
I discuss these strategies because they have the potential to minimize
costs and maximize profits. These strategies are broken down by definition,
potential application, the risk and rewards associated with them, and when
(and when not) to use them.
This section lays the groundwork for you to be able to add a higher
level of sophistication to your trading. You will be able to think beyond the
trade that you may have just executed and see the bigger picture of the
market's movements. Knowing how to use these advanced strategies will
lead to a better understanding of the market and give you the know-how to
react appropriately to the market when it does the unexpected. This skill
is just as valuable as knowing how to get into a trade in the first place.
We explore the concept of synthetic futures and the simultaneous buy
ing and selling of options, and we discover whether a synthetic future is su
perior to a pure futures position. Then we tackle the elusive sell side strad
dle and sell side strangle. This section also contains information on how
to create anyone of the most common intercommodity spreads (grains,
metals, energy). We also analyze how to sell a naked option with the help

of the greeks. Finally the bull call spread and the bear put spread are in
troduced. Traders learn how to match the premium gains with the strike
price differences in order to optimize the benefits of the bull call-bear put
spread.
Much information is covered in few pages. As you progress in your un
derstanding of the various ways that the markets interconnect, it becomes
easier to take chances. Eventually you will be able to fluidly combine basic
and advanced strategies based on the demands of the market, with little
separation between the two approaches.

Exposing
Yourself to Loss
Previously we focused on risk management-investing and trading
with few if any chances being taken with your principal. This chap
ter and the next take a different approach. Now that you have a
thorough understanding of how to minimize risk, these more advanced
techniques can show how to optimize profits. You can expand your ver
satility by mixing these strategies, which expose you to loss, with the risk
limiting strategies found in earlier chapters.
We explore three advanced strategies: synthetic futures, intercommod
ity spreads, and bull call-bear put spreads. Each strategy revolves around
the interrelationship of two or more different markets or two different
contracts all combined together to help maximize returns. Once these
strategies are applied in a trading environment they can diminish margin
expenses, give traders access to market relationships that they didn't know
existed, and put a trader in control of how he interacts with the market.
SYNTHETIC FUTURES, LONG-SHORT
Throughout this book I have liberally included information on trading fu
tures and forex. In fact I have even paired futures contracts with options
to create synthetic option positions. As we learned earlier, a synthetic po
sition combines various types of derivatives to simulate the risk associated
with a pure position. A trader would use a simulated contract for various
reasons. Sometimes it is not easy to obtain a pure position (price, liquidity,
and regulations can playa role). Other times a pure position can prevent

184 ADVANCED STRATEGIES
a trader from maximizing all the different types of profit available to him
(as is the case with options). Finally, a pure position can simply be too
expensive in relationship to a synthetic position.
Putting on a synthetic futures position can solve the problems that can
be associated with having a pure futures, spot, or cash position. A synthetic
futures position is the combination of buying an option and selling a second
option at the san1e strike price, but in the opposite directions. This option
combination gives you unlimited access to profits and loss simultaneously.
It's worth having because the sold option has the potential of paying for
most, if not all, of the premium of the bought option. The combined sold
and bought premium can end up being a fraction of the cost of an outright
futures contract or of purchasing a cash position.
An exchange market you trade a pure' position on can have just one
of the problems discussed previously or the complete trifecta. The stock
market is a prime example of an exchange market that is affected by all
the problems that traders have to contend with. This is in sharp contrast
to the fact that the stock market is very versatile. There are at least three
active derivative markets available to stock investors. At any given time
a trader can buy or sell options, futures, and/or contracts for difference
(CFDs). While there are varying levels of availability, each derivative has
its own associated risk as well as margin and premium price figures.
Often the most economical stock derivatives to trade are the CFDs.
They tend to have the greatest liquidity and can have some of the best trad
ing margins, depending on the publicly listed corporation you trade shares
in. Unfortunately, as of this writing, it is illegal for U.S. traders to trade
directly in CFDs; they're only allowed to trade stock options and stock fu
tures. This is an example of how the first problem-regulatory issues-can
stop traders from participating in the best possible market.
The closest trading alternative to CFDs is single stock futures con
tracts, created by the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 and
designed to be a compromise for both the SEC and the CFTC. Instead, sin
gle stock futures have become the laughingstock of the investment world.
While good in theory, they lack the same mainstream support that CFDs
have gained around the world. This demonstrates the second problem, the
inability to maximize opportunities. The weakness of single stock futures
leaves stock options as the only realistic derivative left to trade.
To get a better understanding of the stock derivatives, let's break down
the numbers. The regulatory compromises that established single stock fu
tures require that there be a uniform margin of 20 percent of a stock's face
value. Depending on the shares that are traded, putting up 20 percent of
the face value can quickly get expensive. Each single stock futures con
tract is based on 100 shares. Before a contract can even be established a
trader must have the required 20 percent margin available to him. If the



==================================================
                     PAGE 199                     
==================================================

Exposing Yourself to Loss 185
underlying 100 shares are valued at $5,000 then a trader is required to put
up $1,000 in margins to obtain one single stock future contract.
A consistent margin rate may actually be the only advantage that single
stock futures have over their CFD counterparts. On the other hand, CFDs
can have margins that range from as little as 10 percent to as much as
50 percent of a stock's face value. This wide range in margin requirement
is solely dependent on the underlying liquidity of the stocks that the CFD
is based on. Therefore, a trader would have to put up a margin that could
vary anywhere in price from $500 to $1,750.
Stock option premiums tend to come out the clear winners whether
they're the fixed margin rates of single stock futures or the variable mar
gins of CFDs. Stock option premiums are quoted in 100 share increments.
Depending on the strike price of a stock option the premium could be just a
few hundred dollars or less. This can playa significant role when deciding
if stock options should be used to create a synthetic futures contract or not.
While the focus has been on the stock market, the same scenario can
also play out on expensive futures contracts such as natural gas, the full
size S&P 500 contract, or the big contract silver. Each of these markets
have margins that are so expensive that it simply makes sense to find the
right combination of options to convert into a synthetic futures position.
What would cost possibly thousands of dollars can be reduced to a few
thousand dollars at most. This is a significant modification, particularly
when the margin for natural gas, as of this writing, is almost $10,000, a
full size S&P 500 contract has a margin requirement at over $22,000, and
the 5000 oz silver margin is $10,000.
When compared side by side with each other a synthetic futures con
tract will be less expensive, on the face of it. Depending on how your bro
kerage or your FCM handles the matter there may be additional margin
requirements. This will come down to your relationship with them. In the
examples below we dissect what a long and a short synthetic futures con
tract actually looks like and compare it to futures counterpart.
Synthetic Futures Long Position
The components required to establish a long synthetic futures contract are
the purchase of a call option and the sale of a put option of the exact same
price. That call gives you access to unlimited profit potential, but the sold
put opens you up to unlimited loss on the downside. This strategy works
best when you buy and sell both options at-the-money; you can collect the
maximum amount of premium. Let's look at the S&P 500 as an example.
A full-sized S&P 500 futures contract has a margin requirement of
$22,500. Earlier we discussed straddles. At that time, we looked at the

straddle option prices as a financial commitment to profiting from the mar
ket's moving in one direction or another. What if we had decided to create
a synthetic futures contract instead (see Figure 12.1 and Table 12.1)?
These two scenarios are a huge difference in price. The first margin
requirement of $22,500 doesn't compare to the net margin requirement of
$725. This is like night and day. This is a huge difference in price, $21,775 to
be exact. But the trade can't be left naked. It has to treated and protected
just like a naked position. Either you can use an option as a hard stop or
you can create a collar on the position.
Based on this example for $3,000 to $4,000, a slightly out-of-the-money
protective put can be purchased at 1345. This would make the maximum
loss of the sold put limited to 5 points. This protective measure also has
the potential to encourage your FCM or brokerage to minimize their re
strictions on your selling options.

So for a total of $4,725 you are trading the value of a full-sized S&P 50n
contract, with risk management protection-the same margin price that an
Emini S&P contract would cost without any risk management in place.
This contract is still a futures contract, though, so you do end up pick
ing a side, long or short. If the market doesn't move in that direction, you
will lose value in your premium. Therefore you must watch the values of
the various premiums, and if the market is moving against your position.
simply exit the position entirely.
Synthetic Futures Short Position
A short synthetic futures position is simply a mirror of a long synthetic
futures position. An at-the-money put is purchased and an at-the-money
call is sold. This opens the door for unlimited profits if the market drops in
value, but it also allows for unlimited loss if the market moves towards the
upside. The actions to protect the synthetic short position are the same as
a normal short position. Purchase a call to protect you from upside risk or
use a collar. Any other form of risk management can be used, but may also
be too complicated to keep track of.
The Brent light sweet crude oil contract is another great commodity
to use a synthetic position with. The Brent light sweet crude oil futures
contract margin is $12,488 (see Figure 12.2 and Table 12.2).

tract is valued at $12,488 and the synthetic is only $930. Another $2,000
(estimate based on the example prices) spent on a protective option po
sition would still only set a speculator back by $2,930. The mini crude oil
contract has a margin of $6,244. The amount of capital committed is half of
the mini contract and you are still gaining value in your position at the full
contract rate.
PRIMARY DRAWBACKS
The key problem with the synthetic futures position is its potential for un
limited loss whenever you sell an option. Another drawback is how your
brokerage firm will treat you when you decide to execute an order of this
type, whether they are flexible and allow the SPAN risk management soft
ware to handle the risk analysis or if they fly by the seat of their pants in
determining the actual risk associated with this strategy. Finally, you have
a limited array of risk management tools at your disposal. The goal is to
not only make sure that you are protected from unlimited risk, but to also
decrease your overall risk profile. This can only be done with some sort of
protective option position. A stop loss or a stop limit will not cut it, and
most likely will backfire by forcing you to maintain futures margin rates.
INTERCOMMODITY SPREAD
From the outset of this book I have been working on you to think like a
professional as well as a hedger. With that in mind there is no way I could
leave out one of the essential concepts of commodities trading, intercom
modity spread trading. This is a big word for the simple concept that there
is more than one use for a single commodity, such as com. When you sit
down at the dinner table you may be eating a piece of com on the cob,
while drinking a soda (which has com syrup), eating a nice piece of chicken
fried steak (which was probably fried with com oil), all while watching an

exclusive special on TV on ethanol (mainly corn) as the next big alternative
fuel source.
Many commodities have multiple uses and purposes in our everyday
lives. Corporations are constantly attempting to figure out more ways to
slice, dice, and shred their way through a commodity to make sure every
last piece is economically viable. They then go to the commodities market
to minimize their risk by splitting up the various risk associated with each
of their commercial products.
Nowhere is this seen more readily than in the commodity markets of
soybean and oil. Each commodity has its own contract and so do their
more popular derivative markets. In soybeans this is known as the crush
spread and in the oil market this is known as the crack spread, named after
the sound oil makes when it's being refined.
Crush Spread: Soybean, Soybean Meal,
Soybean Oil
When soybeans are processed, two by-products are produced, soybean
meal and soybean oil. A soybean grower is always attempting to determine
the value of the two products in relationship to its raw commodity, and
protect himself from any changes in either. The by-product purchasers are
in the same boat. Therefore, when soybean prices are high a buyer will buy
soybean to protect himself while simultaneously shorting soybean meal
and soybean oil just in case prices drop. The sellers/growers, on the other
hand, want to protect themselves from any sudden drops in price so they
will short the soybean market and will go long the soybean meal and soy
bean oil markets to make sure they don't miss out on any jumps in price.
The difference between the spread becomes their net profit, known as the
gross processing margin.
The N ovemberlDecember crush spread is the most common to trade.
It was developed to protect the new crop. Growers attempting to protect
themselves from the traditional cheap prices at harvest tend to exploit
this spread to their best advantage. Regardless of what factors affect soy
beans every day, traders can participate in the crush spread just as easily as
the pros.
The spread trades themselves can give you access to very cheap mar
gins, known as spread margins, which can be 10 times cheaper than stan
dard margins. In order to trade a standard soybean contract you would
have to put up over $5,000 in margin; the listed spread margin is just $500.
This is a big difference. The reason spread margins can be so low is be
cause of the perceived risk management, of being both long and short in
the same commodity complex. By now you are probably beginning to see
a pattern.

==================================================

190 ADVANCED STRATEGIES
To trade the crush spread is quite simple. The Chicago Board of Trade
(CBOT) has determined that 60 pounds of soybean is the equivalent of
11 pounds of soybean oil and 48 pounds of soybean meal. There are two
choices: either you can use a trading ratio of 1 soybean contract to 1
soybean meal and 1 soybean oil contract or, if you are going for abso
lute accuracy you can trade 10 soybean contracts to 11 soybean meal
contracts and 9 soybean oil contracts. The latter ratio will approximate
50,000 bushels for each contract. The CBOT calls this the package trade
(see Figure 12.3).
In fact, the CBOT established a crush options contract in 2006. Due to
high demand and popularity of the intercommodity soybean crush trade,
they wanted to allow the corporations (that is, the pros) to protect their
crush position conveniently. In doing so, they have allowed everyday buy
ers and sellers to have one tool, without having to muck about with ratios
and conversions, to track the crush spread and to treat it like any other
option trade.
In keeping with the focus of the option being primarily for the profes
sionals, buying a call means you are long the by-products and short the
soybeans and buying a put means you are short the by-products but long
the soybeans.
The primary drawback of any spread, as we discussed earlier, is that
you can be wishboned in your trade. Therefore stops and stop limits are
necessary to protect yourself from your position going south on you.

Crack Spread: Crude Oil, Heating Oil, Gasoline
Another popular intercommodity spread is the crack spread (see Fig
ure 12.4). This spread shows the interrelationship between heating oil.
gasoline, and crude oil. In identical fashion to the soybean crush spread.
oil refiners attempt to hedge their risk from crude oil prices and its refined
products. The most popular ratio is the 3:2: 1 ratio: three crude oil futures
contracts to two unleaded gasoline futures contracts to one heating oil fu
tures contract.
The oil is bought in the front month and its by-products are sold in the
following month or vice versa. In 1994 the New York Mercantile Exchange
(NYMEX) made the crack spread convenient for all traders by considering
this spread as one purchase, similar to the CBOT option. With oil shortages
being predicted for decades to come this is a simple and inexpensive way
for speculators to trade oil futures with a margin value that doesn't exceed
$10,000.
Gold-Silver Ratio Spread
Finally, there is the gold-silver ratio spread. This spread has long been used
to determine how expensive or inexpensive gold is at any given time. The
theory follows that if it takes more ounces of silver to purchase gold than
it did previously, then gold is considered expensive. If it takes less silver
to purchase gold, again regardless of the price, then gold is inexpensive.

192 ADVANCED STRATEGIES
By playing around with this relationship, a trader can buy or sell gold and
silver in the hope that they can profit from sudden increases or drops in
value of both these precious metals.
Silver bugs believe that the prices of silver and gold should naturally
revert to their historic interrelated monetary ratio of 16:1. As the prices
wrestle for position there is a belief either that now is a good time to short
gold and buy silver or that silver can increase in value to bring the ratio
back in alignment. Whatever the case there is a constant hope that the
prices will revert back to the mean to recreate this historic relationship.
With this hope in place, whenever gold is stronger than silver there is a
short gold, buy silver bias.
Whether you believe in trading the gold/silver ratio spread or not, oth
ers do. As a result, it is important to understand the psychology of those
around you so you can better recognize opportunities in the precious metal
sector for yourself.
In Figure 12.5 we see gold on the top and silver on the bottom; this
chart follows these two commodities from January 2008 until July 2008.
As you can see, the two precious metals move in tandem pretty closely.
Nevertheless, it looks like the swings in the silver market are a little more
aggressive. On July 9,2008, silver was at $18.175 and gold was at $929.60.
According to those numbers the ratio of silver to gold was 51: 1. In order for
the traditional ratio of 16:1 to come into effect, silver would have to triple

in price to $54 an ounce or gold would have to drop to $290 an ounce. You
would have to be the judge of what most likely would happen.
PRIl\IARY DRAWBACKS
Spread trading can be tricky. While you are given cheaper margins because
the trades, on the surface, appear lower risk, don't let down your guard.
These trades are meant to be treated with the same respect as any naked
position out there. Using options as a stop loss or putting stops in place
to protect yourself is required. There are no shortcuts when using spread
trading.
THE BULL CALL SPREAD AND
BEAR PUT SPREAD
The third advanced technique that can be employed is the bull call spread
and bear put spread. These are mirror images of each other. They are a
sophisticated way of combining an at-the-money option and an out-of-the
money option. This type of strategy is a way to get the market to pay for
part of your trading. By collecting a premium you are able to reduce the
overall expense of an at-the-money option while giving yourself the oppor
tunity to profit from the market's move.
Bull Call Spread
A bull call spread is the simultaneous purchase of an at-the-money option
and the sale of an out-of-the-money option. The difference in value between
the two different strike prices is what creates the profit opportunity for the
trader. What makes this strategy attractive is the fact that you are able to
purchase an at-the-money option at a discount. For expensive or highly
volatile markets such as the S&P 500, euro, or crude oil, this is the easiest
way to get into their options. If you have an account of $15,000 or less you
can find that when you purchase an at-the-money option, one-third to two
thirds of your capital can be tied up for an extended period of time. The
bull call spread gives your capital much needed relief.
In return for this reprieve you have to give up the main trading advan
tage that options have-unlimited profit potential. Your trading activity is
locked between the difference in the two strike prices. This cap in your
profits, while unpleasant, if done right, can add enough to the bottom line
so that this technique will no longer be necessary.

194 ADVANCED STRATEGIES
Call premium paid $1.2500 (- $2,975)
Call premium collected $1.2700 (+$900)
Difference $1.2700 (-$2,075)
In the bull call spread example there is an overall bullish bias for the
euro market, so a bull call spread is used. By selling a $1.27 call, $900 in pre
miums are collected. An at-the-money call option is purchased for $2,975.
This leaves a net cost of $2,075.
Bull Call Spread At-the-Money One of three scenarios can play out.
First, the trade is successful and the difference between $1.25 and $1.27
is collected as a profit. That would make a total profit of approximately
$2,500. If the market stays at the $1.27 level and doesn't break through you
will be able to keep your profits, plus the premium you collected, for a
grand total of $3,400.
The second scenario would force the price past the $1.27 strike price.
Any money above and beyond $1.27 will be forfeited along with the $900
in collected premium. That would leave you with $2,500 in profits, but you
would have to hold on to the position until expiration.
The third possible scenario is that the market tanks below the $1.25
level. You have one of two choices: You can hold on until all of your pre
mium is eroded, which would give you an official loss, or you can exit once
the accumulated losses are equal to the amount of the premium that you
have collected. This would let you exit your trade at almost breakeven.
If you fiddle around with closer strike prices you will be able to collect
more premium on the sold option, but at the expense of your profit poten
tial between the two strike prices. This requires a balancing act between
profit goals and risk management that needs to be calculated before the
trade is ever executed (see Figure 12.6).
Bear Put Spread
A bear put spread is the mirror opposite of the bull call spread. In the
bear put spread a put option is purchased at-the-money and an out-of-the
money put option is sold. The premium collected offsets the costs of
the bought put, and the difference between the two strike prices is your
profit.
This strategy is designed to catch any move in the market's value to the
downside. All the same potential scenarios exist for the bear put spread:
The market price can drop, but not break past the sold option's strike price;

the market price can drop and break through the sold call's strike price; or
the market can move up and break through the bought option's strike price.
Each example is a different opportunity to interact with the market,
but in a limited fashion. The bear put spread limits you from having unlim
ited profit opportunities, but it can strengthen your understanding of the
market's rhythms. In Figure 12.7 we look at the corn market and see how a
bear put spread would have looked like had we executed this kind of trade.
PRII\IARY DRAWBACKS
When investing in real estate, location is everything. When trading the bull
call spread and the bear put spread, premium is everything. If the collected
premium is too little to justify the cap in profits, don't do it. If the collected
premium is a lot, maybe your two strike prices are too close in value and
you are capping your profits too tightly.
It also must be kept in mind that these trades can lose money. There
is no risk management associated with these trades. In a volatile market
that is moving against you, you can end up losing your entire premium if
you are not prepared for any sudden drop in value. This adds another level

of vigilance to your trading or more complexity if you use any of the risk
management tools mentioned earlier.
CONCLUSION
This group of advanced strategies can be exciting to use as long as you un
derstand the exposure to loss. The synthetic futures expose you to unlim
ited loss, the intercommodity spreads expose you to being wishboned and
losing on two sides of a trade simultaneously, and the bull call spread and
the bear put spread expose you to losing most if not all of your option's
premium. What makes any of these strategies worthwhile is that they re
duce your costs and give you the ability to trade in markets that otherwise
may be out of your accounts trading range.
Trade these strategies with the intent of including other risk manage
ment tools to fully optimize them. This will have the immediate effect of
power-boosting your account and helping you find trading opportunities
that you may otherwise overlook or ignore.

All that glitters is not gold.
-William Shakespeare, The Merchant of Venice
The epigraph chosen for this chapter is intentionally misquoted. The
original sentence from the play is "All that glisters is not gold." Over
the years we have given the original a modernized turn of phrase.
While there are only subtle differences between glitters and glisters, they
are significant enough to warrant two separate words. That is the case with
the subject of this chapter.
The majority of the book has focused on pairing up your buy and sell
strategies. Whether you were purchasing options to protect your futures
positions or putting on spread positions with two or more futures posi
tions, you were constantly covering one risk with another. In this chapter
we shift gears. Prevailing knowledge says that "90 percent of options ex
pire worthless"; but if that is the case, why would anyone ever buy options?
Just as the Shakespearean quote "All that glisters is not gold" has changed
over time, so has a real understanding of what it means that 90 percent of
options expire worthless.
In this chapter we return to charts used in Chapter 4 to review how
to sell a strangle and a straddle, as well as how to put on a naked short
position. Yet before we can delve deeply into the strategies, a popular myth
about options must be busted. The myth that "90 percent of options expire
worthless" leads to a fallacy of logic that can create problems for the savvy
trader attempting to make money selling options.
With any statement there is an inverse logic that can be used to test the
accuracy or truthfulness of the statement itself. So if 90 percent of options

expire worthless, that means that if you only sell options you will have a
90 percent success rate. Anyone who has ever attempted to test this the
ory has soon found himself or herself at a disadvantage. The presumed 90
percent success rate rarely, if ever, materializes.
In life there are few absolutes, and possibly even fewer near absolutes.
The idea that "90 percent of options expire worthless" simply doesn't ring
true, but somehow it has stuck. Although options do have a high expira
tion rate, there is a reason for that high rate that is best understood before
attempting any of the income-generating ideas in this chapter.
DO 90 PERCENT OF OPTIONS ~
EXPIRE WORTHLESS?
A lie told often enough becomes the truth.
-Vladimir Lenin
Allover the Internet the option rhetoric is the same: 90 percent of op
tions expire worthless. Others will claim that the figure is not as high as
90 percent, but possibly 70 to 80 percent. Where do any of these figures
come from? Let's look at the language of the research to see if there is
a discrepancy between this statement and the statements of some the re
search studies that have been done regarding options.
The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) has been maintaining
data on options since 1973. The CBOE's researchers discovered a largely
overlooked fact: that not all options are held until expiration. This is mon
umentally important when attempting to determine where figures such as
90 percent actually come from. The CBOE broke down option outcomes
into a simple formula: 10/60/30. Ten percent of all options are exercised
(converted to the underlying asset); approximately 60 percent of the op
tions are closed (offset) before expiration; and the remaining 30 percent
are held until expiration.
It is very likely that all of the remaining 30 percent of options actually
expire worthless; the CBOE's formula does not mean that 90 percent of
all options expire worthless. In a study done by the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange (CME), ranging from 1997 to 1999, the researchers decided to
come to a definitive conclusion on the exact percentage of options that
expire worthless. In their research they concluded that 76.5 percent of the
options that were held until expiration expired worthless.
This is significant. If only 30 percent of options are held until expira
tion, and of those that are held until expiration 76.5 percent expire worth
less, then the statement that "90 percent of options expire worthless" is not

==================================================

Advanced Option Selling Strategies 199
only false, but a bold-faced lie-a lie that has been perpetuated over and
over until it has become a marketing fact. The idea of "options held until
expiration" and "options expiring" have been merged into one monolithic
idea that is simply comparing apples to oranges.
The fact that only 30 percent of options reach expiration does not mean
that the remaining 70 percent of options are successful. We know that
10 percent of all options are converted into the underlying asset; this is a
sign that 10 percent of all options are guaranteed to be successful. We also
know that about 60 percent of options are offset before they ever reach
expiration. Some of those are profitable and some are not profitable, but
none of them have ever reached expiration. So where does the 90 percent
figure come from?
It likely derives from the fact that only 10 percent of options are con
verted into their underlying asset. That means 90 percent of options aren't
converted into the underlying futures contract or stock. So undoubtedly
the assumption is that if 90 percent of options aren't converted then they
must expire worthless. This is a false assumption that is simply not sup
ported by the numbers. Even in the small percentage of options that do
expire, 30 percent, some of these expire with a cash value (13.5 percent,
according to the CME).
So while we know that the percentage of options that expire worthless
is not 90 percent, there is reason to believe that a majority of options do
lose money. With 50 to 60 percent of contracts being offset before expira
tion and the majority of options that reach expiration expiring worthless,
the odds are in favor of 50 to 60 percent of options to be losing trades. While
50 to 60 percent is less than the touted 90 percent figure, selling options is
still a promising opportunity.
Becoming an Option Seller
It is exciting to hear that "90 percent of options expire worthless." It gives
you the feeling of being an insider and the hope of finding a magic bullet
with which to win the so-called trading game. Only once you attempt it do
the numbers not add up to the hype. It is easy to be down on yourself and
assume that somehow you are doing something wrong. This is not the case;
it is just the classic example of being overpromised and underdelivered on
that promise.
There are some empowering realities in knowing the truth about op
tions that will make your option sales easier. First, the fact that the ma
jority of options are not held until expiration releases you from holding on
to the hope that the option that you sold, that is now losing you money, is
worth holding on to until the absolute end. This reinforces the concept of
cutting your losses as quickly as possible.

                     PAGE 214                     
==================================================

200 ADVANCED STRATEGIES
Second, you can feel confident, as a seller, that if you make money on
the contract you can sell it into the marketplace (offset) along with the ma
jority of traders with little or no worry that you have somehow missed out
on profits. You are doing nothing different from what other option traders
are doing.
Finally, you are releasing yourself from making a financial commitment
that you cannot afford to make. When you sell options, you are limiting
your profit to the premiums that you collect and exposing yourself to un
limited risk. If you believe that 90 percent of options expire worthless, it
becomes easier to take risks and chances that you would otherwise avoid,
because you believe the odds are in your favor.
How differently will a trader operate if he knows that when he sells
an option he possibly has a 60 percent chance of the trade going in his
direction, and only half of those will make it to expiration? One hopes he
will operate with the caution and respect that selling options requires, and
will sell options with his eyes wide open.
The following option selling techniques-selling straddles, strangles,
and naked options-all have the opportunity to be profitable, in much the
same way that purchasing options is successful. Selling options requires
the same vigilance and common sense as purchasing options if you hope
to make your trading plan successful. The ability to stick with your money
management techniques and your trading goals will help you make sure
that selling options is worthwhile.
WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN
SELLING OPTIONS
In Chapter 4, where we began this journey, we introduced the concepts
of straddles and strangles. At that time we looked at the straddle and
strangle as opportunities to take advantage of sideways markets and news
announcements, and to hedge your bets against wild fluctuations in the
market's movements. One of the key drawbacks to both the straddle and
the strangle is the possibility that the market will do nothing. If that oc
curs, you have the opportunity to lose part or all of your option premium,
on both your put and your call, if you are not careful.
Options and futures trading is a zero-sum game; as we have dis
cussed before, the premium you pay doesn't simply evaporate into thin air.
Someone on the other side of your buying transaction has collected that
premium. There is a trade-off, though. While the option buyers have an
opportunity to make as much money as possible, the option sellers are re
stricted to the premium they receive, while being exposed to unlimited risk.

                     PAGE 215                     
==================================================

Advanced Option Selling Strategies 20J
With added exposure to unlimited risk, the question is, "Why would
anyone sell options?" As we have seen, the old adage "90 percent of op
tions expire worthless" is not true, but the reality still favors that at least
60 percent of options most likely lose money. Couple the fact that more op
tions lose money than make money with the advanced knowledge of what
type of return on your money you will receive when you sell options, and
selling options becomes a more comfortable alternative to the unknown.
Selling options cannot occur in a vacuum, though. You can't sell an
option and forget about it. You must use stops, stop limits, and preferably
protective buy options to back up your option sales. However you protect
yourself from your option sales, it is simply important to do it. The reality
still is that 40 percent of options are likely profitable. If you are caught on
the wrong side of your option sale it can be disastrous. One misstep can
wipe out all of your accumulated profits.
Margins and Option Selling
In futures and commodities trading it is not easy to sell options. While long
and short futures contracts are treated the same, options are not treated
with the same deference. When you purchase an option, your entire capital
commitment is limited to the cost of the option premium. If the option
premium is $500, then you are required to put up $500. Option selling is
different.
Selling options exposes the seller to unlimited risk. This risk, while the
responsibility is on the seller, is shared by the brokerage and the clearing
firm. If the market moves excessively against the seller and for some reason
he cannot pay, the loss first falls on the shoulders of the brokerage to pay
for the loss, and it is extended to the clearing firm to cover any difference.
Similar to how protective the stock market is against shorting shares,
selling options can be difficult to accomplish. While the stock market mon
itors shorting shares by restricting the number of shares available for bor
rowing, selling options has no such mechanism. Instead, clearing firms
and brokerages force option sellers to make a capital commitment to their
trade. This typically comes in the form of putting up the equivalent margin
that would be needed to take an actual futures position.
For example, if you decide to sell an option worth $500 on corn and the
margin is $1,350, you will receive a credit in your account for the premium,
but you will also be required to have at least $1,350 in your account in order
to initiate the option sale.
Another quirk of options is the fact that you will not be able to col
lect 100 percent of the premium until the option has expired. Only at that
time will you have the profits transferred to your account free and clear.

This can be frustrating for those who want to accumulate the premium to
initiate new trades, as we saw earlier when we discussed ratio spreads.
If you succeed in holding on to your sold option until expiration, the
odds are in your favor (76.5 percent according to the CME) that you will
collect your full premium. Alternatively, you can offset your successful
sold option at any time by purchasing the corresponding option back. This
same concept applies to selling calls.
For example, if you sell a put at a particular strike price, you must
purchase a put at that exact same strike price in order to offset it. If you
sold the put at $500 and you purchase the same put back at $200, your net
profit will be $300. Your account will be adjusted accordingly, and you will
lose $200 in premium from your account.
There are numerous reasons why you would offset your option
position ahead of expiration; perhaps you achieve your target profit, you
are worried that the market may shift suddenly based on some news event,
or it is part of a broader strategy. Whatever the reason, do not hold on to a
losing position until expiration in hopes that the trade will turn around all
ofasudden.
STRANGLES, STRADDLES,
OR NAI{ED OPTIONS
Strangles, straddles, and naked options-which type of trade is best?
Naked options have a tendency to fall into the same category as simply
buying options. If you have a bearish market bias, you sell calls; if you have
a bullish market bias, then sell puts. While having a market bias is essential
to anyone's long-term success, trading that market bias can be dangerous,
particularly when you have all or nothing riding on one premium. This is
what selling naked options means.
If the trade fails, we know that selling options exposes you to unlimited
risk. The worst-case scenario for a naked option seller is for the underlying
asset to become lock limit against the option. The underlying asset cannot
be exited, so the option's volatility increases exponentially. The potential
to lose thousands to gain a few hundred quickly becomes not worth it.
While there are ways to salvage or at least minimize the impact of
a market moving against a naked option seller, it is best to have the
proper option selling strategy set in place at the outset. This can best be
accomplished by selling options only in sideways markets and using a sell
straddle or sell strangle to let the market dictate what direction it wishes to
go. This eliminates the need to have a market bias, while at the same time
expanding your trading opportunities.

Naked option selling can be profitable. By monitoring the theta (de
cline of option time value) and the vega (measure of increase and decr a.. ...
of option based on volatility), along with the expiration date, you can a -
tempt to go through the option candidates and cherry-pick the ones mo ...
likely to sell. However, if you overoptimize your decision-making progre ".
you may find that there is not enough intrinsic value to make selling tlw
option worthwhile.
When executing straddles and strangles, the same type of market bia.c.,
as in selling naked options evolves from the market's movement, not from
any type of arbitrary decision-making process. Selling two options can be
expensive, but it is a solid way to be able to participate in some of the most
profitable options around. Theta and vega are also important, but there is
no need to be 100 percent dependent on these two values in order to deter
mine what options to select. They become secondary monitoring tools to
reinforce a decision that the market has already made.
In the following exan1ples we analyze straddles, strangles, and naked
options in order to determine the best opportunity. From there we will
learn exactly how to pick profitable opportunities.
SELL STRADDLE
A sell straddle is also known as a short straddle. This is a strategy that
is designed to take advantage of the market's volatility. The object is to
sell a put and a call, both at-the-money options. At-the-money options have
the highest built-in premium because of their high level of volatility. This
volatility works in the option sellers' favor because they collect the maxi
mum amount of money possible, knowing for a fact that when the volatility
decreases they have an opportunity to profit from both the put and the call
simultaneously.
The primary drawback of a straddle is the fact that the market rarely
stays at the exact same price. So it is important to pay attention to the value
of the underlying asset in relation to the options that were sold.
Short Straddle Examples
In Figure 13.1 we have a view of the gold chart on February 26, 2008. The
underlying contract expires in April, and the option has one more month
before expiration on March 28, 2008. The market is flat in anticipation of
the upcoming February 27, 2008, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)
interest rate announcement.
We have an opportunity to sell a 940 call for $1,830 and a put for $1,950.
When selling options, we have to take into consideration the breake ven

point of the option buyer. Options purchases don't break even on their
purchase until the underlying price of the option exceeds the cost of the
premium paid.
Breakeven for the person who buys the call occurs when the underly
ing price of gold reaches $958.30-total of premium paid ($18.30) plus the
strike price (940). The person who buys the put won't break even until the
price reaches $920.50-premium paid ($19.50) minus the strike price (940).
(See Table 13.1.)
As an option seller you are collecting nearly as much premium as pos
sible. An optimal at-the-money option delta is approximately 50 percent,
the 940 call's delta is at 48.3 percent, and the 940 put's delta is at 51.4 per
cent. This means that you have to be willing to cut your losses on the losing

option position as quickly as possible in order to retain as high a return on
investment (ROI) as possible.
If you have to exit either option, the projected ROIs of 34 percent and
36 percent are cut in half. Once you have to pick the call position to keep.
then your 34 percent ROI on $5,400 becomes a 17 percent return based
on $10,400, minus whatever loss you may incur on your put position. The
inverse is equally true. Once you decide to keep the put position, your 36
percent ROI turns into an 18 percent ROI.
The only factor working in the option seller's favor is the decreasing
time value. Every day the contract gets closer to expiration it loses more of
its value, as long as the underlying asset fails to move significantly toward
either breakeven point. In Figure 13.2 we see the market's big spike over
the next 30 days.
On February 26, 2008, we see the underlying gold market begin to take
off. In one day it moves $13. This is an obvious cue to exit the gold market
call option. The obvious winner in this pair, for the option seller, is the put
option. By letting go of the call option as close to breakeven as possible,
the option seller can keep the put option premium of $1,950, minus the call
expenses.
With a delta of almost 50 percent, that means every $1 move was equal
to 50 cents. If you exit after the $13 move, the potential hit would be $6.50

or $650. This puts your total profits at $1,300, approximately a 12 percent
return on $10,800 in 30 days.
While the return is a little way away from the hoped-for 18 percent,
and a third of the value had you simply sold a naked option, it is still
significantly better than the stock market's historical return of 12 percent
a year. This is the reason option sellers are willing to endure the potential
for unlimited risk. The ability to not only calculate your potential returns
in advance, but also hold on to your money in your account the entire time
is a significant comfort for a certain type of investor.
As we look at Figure 13.2 we see the roller-coaster ride that the market
can take. It actually moves up rather quickly, only to die down and reverse
itself as the option gets closer to expiration. Had we held on to the call we
offset early on in the move we, would have profited from both positions.
That is the beauty of having 20/20 hindsight. With money management
rules and profit goals in place we couldn't hold on to the call we sold. We
could only follow what the rhythm of the market was at that time. For this
reason alone the statistical option model of 10/60/30 is most likely true.
Had we held on to both the call and put until expiration, we would
have fallen into the 30 percent category, with the majority of those expiring
worthless. Unfortunately, the reality of the short-term situation didn't allow
us to hold on with the threat of unlimited risk hanging over our heads. So
instead we fell into the 60 percent category (with the call option) of those
who offset their options contract before the expiration date and into the
30 percent category (with the put option) of those options that are held
until expiration.
Short Straddle Wrap-Up
There are a great number of benefits in putting on a short straddle; you
can take advantage of volatility, you're able to gain the maximum premium
possible, and you can collect your return on your investment ahead of time.
The risks and rewards have to be weighed out, though. Selling options ex
poses you to unlimited risk, and even though they don't move in tandem
with the underlying asset, if you are not careful you will quickly erode
whatever little returns you expected.
Unlike the unlimited profit potential of purchasing options, selling op
tions limits your profit to the initial premium, and any unexpected move
ments or volatility in the markets can jeopardize your opportunity to keep
this profit. The primary saving grace of selling options is the simple fact
that the majority of options do lose value. This and this alone makes it
worthwhile to incorporate shorting straddles into your trading plan from
time to time.

Advanced Option Selling Strategies 207
SELL STRANGLE
The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) has an excellent glossary
on its web site regarding options. NYMEX defines a short strangle as sim
ilar to a short straddle, but the short call and the short put have different
strike prices. This definition is just as good as any other definition. Some
of the nuances of shorting or selling a strangle are lost in the definition,
though.
On average, while selling options does expose traders to risk, that risk
is diminished when an out-of-the-money option is sold. Whenever you sell
an option you are faced with the potential of unlimited risk, and this risk
is only mitigated by the fact that the further out-of-the-money an option is,
the less likely for the underlying asset to hit its strike price.
There are a few drawbacks to putting on a short strangle. One of the
main drawbacks is the amount of premium collected. While you are putting
up a significant margin to protect against the unlimited risk you are ex
posed to, the premium that you receive may bring in only a small ROI.
Another drawback is that in order to be profitable, short strangles need
to thrive in a low-volatility marketplace. The less volatile the market is, the
better it can be for the option seller. The lack of volatility is great on the
one hand because it increases the likelihood that the options will expire
worthless. On the other hand, a low-volatility option market means that you
cannot sell options and command a high premium. It becomes a serious
measure of risk versus reward before deciding to put on a short strangle.
Short Strangle Examples
These examples are meant to highlight what a potential short strangle po
sition can look like. The examples have been plucked from Chapter 4. At
that time we were purchasing a strangle, whereas in these examples we
are taking a second look at the charts from the perspective of the seller.
By mastering the short strangle you can apply another approach to your
trading repertoire.
In the examples that follow we look at two different markets, the gold
market and the S&P 500 commodities market. Each market has its own
rhythms and behavior, but they still follow the same rules when it comes
to using the strangle as a trading technique.
In the first example (see Figure 13.3 and Table 13.2) we take another
look at the gold market. There is a simple setup. We sell a 960 call and
an 890 put. With only the limited information provided by the charts and
the options, we can make an informed decision about a few fundamental
factors.

For the call position we know the following: First, we have found a
decent resistance level at 960; the gold market has bumped against this
high for three days without breaking through. Second, if the market does
break through the 960 level, we will lose only $31.50 for every $1 move.
Third, the market would have to hit and break through $968 before the
option buyer would begin to profit.
For the put position we know that the market is currently $70 away
from our $890 strike price. We also know that not only will the market
need to drop to $890, but it will have to hit $885 before it begins to move
in-the-money. In the meantime, for every $1 that the gold market moves
up, our $890 put loses $18 in value. This means that ifthe market moves up
$30 ($960 + $30 = $990), the option that we sold will be virtually worthless

and we could offset our gold 890 put and still gain the majority of premium
without waiting for expiration.
In Figure 13.4 we see gold break through $960, moving into new terri
tory. On February 27, 2008, gold moves $4, eventually closing at $965.90.
This is less than $3 away from the option buyer's breakeven of $968. This
move requires that we offset the 960 call that we sold. In order to accom
plish this we would have placed a stop order at $960, with the hope that we
would not lose more than $100 on this side of the trade.
With a $100 loss on the sold call, that effectively leaves us a profit of
only $430 on our sold 890 put option. On March 5, 2008, gold closes above
$990, reaching as high as $999.90 that day. This move signaled gold touch
ingjust below an important psychological number of $1,000 per ounce. This
move also triggers the $30 target we needed in order to offset our 890 put
to obtain the maximum premium.
In Table 13.3 we see that the total gain on the gold short strangle is
$420 over the course of five days. On a $10,800 investment this produces
nearly a 4 percent return. On the face of it that is not a very impressive
return. If you extrapolate it to a monthly return figure, though, you would
have a monthly return of 24 percent, since six sets of five days equals 30
days or one month. If you extrapolate it out to an annual return, you are
looking at a simple, noncompounded, return of 288 percent!

is not a phenomenal return on the face of it, it can be a significant income
boost to anyone's portfolio. Who would turn down an effective annual rate
of return of 288 percent?
In Figure 13.5 we put on the exact same type of strangle on the S&P

with an S&P 500 1325 put and collect $2,250.

.3 67 means that our option's value increases by one-third of the underlying
asset, in this case only about 5 points. As the option stays in-the-money, the
delta increases and if we are not careful we will continue to bleed money.
We get off easy with an approximate $250 loss (5 points x $50).
In Figure 13.6 we see that in order to offset the S&P 500 1400 call in
this environment the price of the underlying futures contract has to drop
a little over 50 points. Every point drop is the equivalent of $50, but since
the delta rate of change is a little under one-half, we would need a total of
a 50-point drop to reach the total value of the premium, $25 (one-half point
movement) x 50 points = $1,250. Our ideal exit to offset our call position
would be 1275 (1325 - 50 points) (see Tables 13.4 and 13.5).

Two days after closing below 1325, the S&P 500 market hits 1277, two
points above our target goal. We can still offset the call we sold by pur
chasing an inexpensive S&P 5001400 call at $50. In Table 13.5 we see that
the entire strangle brings in $950 after only'eight days of being in the trade.
We risked a total of $45,000 to earn $950; this is a return of 2 percent on
our money. If you could make 2 percent every eight days, you would make
7 percent per month, or an annual return of 84 percent.
Although you are not breaking the bank, an annual rate of return of
84 percent exceeds both the stock market's and the bond market's annual
historic returns. This is a prime example of how a small 2 percent return
can playa significant role in changing your investing success.
Short Strangle Wrap-Up
Strangles are a less profitable alternative to straddles, but they clearly have
a leg up when it comes to risk. There is little doubt that if you sell the right
option you will have the opportunity to collect the premium with little or no
hassle. The only thing standing in your way is simply the challenge of pick
ing the right option to sell. The short strangle strategy allows you to hedge
your bets. At the same time, a short strangle gives you enough breathing
room between different strike prices to get you out of the trade altogether
if, for some reason, it proves too difficult to hold on to.
Short strangles are also perfect for markets that just can't break out
of their sideways momentum. If the market is stuck between a significant
support and resistance point, there is an opportunity to profit from both the
put and the call. This type of double-dipping with option premiums can't be
accomplished in a straddle. This is what makes selling a strangle a lot more
desirable to selling a straddle in the long run.
NAKED OPTION SELLING
For the record, I do not recommend naked option selling. Of all of the
techniques, I consider naked options to be the most risky. This is the only

Advanced Option Selling Strategies 213
advanced strategy that I have discussed in the book that is not automati
cally paired up with a spot, futures, or other option position to protect you
from the risk. The key reason that it is even mentioned in this chapter is be
cause shorting straddles and strangles can't be honestly discussed without
at least acknowledging their origin.
Naked option selling has two handicaps: misinformation and lever
age. The first handicap, misinformation, was discussed at the outset of this
chapter. The fictional number of 90 percent of options expiring worthless
was rightly dispelled, but it also reduces the level of confidence that can be
had in believing in its overall success, particularly when only 30 percent of
options actually make it to their expiration dates.
The second handicap is leverage. When initiating a futures contract,
doing a spot forex transaction, or purchasing an option, it can be comfort
ing to know that the leverage is on your side. The amount of money you
can earn on your positions is vastly superior, in terms of percentage, to the
actual amount you have put up. In gold trading a $1 move is equal to $100. It
only takes a $54 move to match the necessary futures margin, $5,400. This
leverage works against naked option sellers.
If an option seller sells an at-the-money option and collects $1,800, it
only takes an $18 move into-the-money, at $100 per $1 move, to eliminate
his entire collected premium. If an out-of-the-money option is sold for $800,
then it simply takes an $8 move into-the-money against the seller before he
gives up all of his profits. Although there is more leeway between the strike
price and the cash price when it comes to an out-of-the-money option, it
still doesn't take much to eliminate the collected premium.
There are two primary benefits of selling naked options. First, your
margin reserves are 50 percent of what it would take when putting on
short straddles and strangle positions. A second key benefit is that you
know ahead of time what your potential return on investment can be. In
Table 13.6 we see that a gold 940 call has the potential to return 34 percent,
and in Table 13.7 we see that a gold 960 call has the potential to return
15 percent.
As you sell options further and further out-of-the-money, your overall
return diminishes, but the likelihood of you getting that return increases.

This is a constant trade-off when it comes to selling naked options. How
far can you sell your option contract out-of-the-money before the amount
of capital you tie up doesn't justify the unlimited risk you are exposed to
and the limited returns you are capable of earning?
This is not an easy question to answer. It becomes a personal choice of
whether you wish to earn 15 percent or 5 percent. Your technical analysis
tools or market opinion will determine how you expect to interact with the
market and where you expect it to go. The more aggressive may sell only
at-the-money options, and the less aggressive will sell out-of-the-money op
tions. However you approach selling options, do not take it lightly.
There are two other ways to sell naked options, in-the-money and based on
theta, that have not been discussed at length. First, selling an in-the-money op
tion requires a level of understanding of the greeks that is outside the scope
of this book. And even if you understand the greeks, there is still no guaran
tee of success. This would make selling an in-the-money option akin to a sui
cide mission, no matter how much premium could be collected. Second, using
time decay or theta to make your selling decision may not always be prudent.
Just like out-of-the-money options, the closer you get to expiration, the less pre
mium you will be able to collect. So make theta a component of your decision
making process but not the sole reason for selling; otherwise you may be
disappointed at the results.
Naked Option Wrap-Up
Tackling a naked option is much like tackling a regular futures contract.
There is so much exposure to risk that the rewards may not be there.
If you sell an at-the-money option you can collect a significant premium,
compared to shorting a straddle or a strangle. Selling only one option di
minishes your capital commitment to the brokerage firm as well. Neverthe
less, with the increased premium comes increased exposure to risk. The

==================================================

exposure to unlimited risk compared to the premium that can be collected
makes the sale of an at-the-money option less attractive.
Selling out-of-the-money options can be slightly more attractive. While
unlimited risk still looms over the seller's head, time decay and decreased
volatility work in favor of the option seller. The key trade-off between
selling an at-the-money option versus an out-of-the-money option is the
amount of collected premium. Where an at-the-money option premium has
a potential return as high as 30 percent or more, an out-of-the-money op
tion may bring in as little as 5 to 7 percent. If the market suddenly moves
against an out-of-the-money option seller, the limited rewards-5 to 7 per
cent returns-simply don't justify the exposure to unlimited risk.
If a trader chooses to be a naked option seller, the risk and reward must
constantly be weighed. Once the rewards are significantly diminished by
the potential risk, a reassessment must be done on how to approach that
risk. This may mean either avoiding selling options altogether or making
sure you take advantage of the daisy-chain relationship of the spot, options,
and futures markets combined for maximum opportunity.
CONCLUSION
Whether you are selling straddles, strangles, or naked options, you are ex
posing yourself to a significant amount of risk. Much of this risk can be
offset by buying options to counter the risk, but once that is done, we
move into more exotic trading of synthetic futures and synthetic futures
collars, techniques we discussed earlier in the book. Purchasing an addi
tional option as protection forces you to use the premium you collected
inefficiently, practically eliminating the entire reason you sold the option
in the first place.
The smart way to manage your option selling risk is to simply use a
stop. Since options do not move at the same speed as the underlying as
set, you have an opportunity to exit with a little less sticker shock, as op
posed to dealing with slippage in the futures market and the volatile forex
market.
Also keep in mind that these techniques have been shoved into the
advanced section, deep in the back of the book, for a reason. This is a style
of trading that should not be taken lightly and quite literally is not meant for
everyone. Paper trading and demo trading the ideas in this chapter should
not need to be emphasized, but I will point out one more time that selling
options involves unlimited risk, and when it comes to trading in futures and
commodities you can not only lose your entire investment, but you can also
lose much more.

Sell options with both caution and common sense, and you will find
yourself tapping into small, but consistent, profit opportunities for the rest
of your life. Many successful Commodity Trading Advisors have success
fully created practices solely around selling options or establishing strad
dles and strangles. The trick to being successful at selling options comes
from your ability to temper your profit goals. If you are willing to tum your
back on the potential of unlimited risk in favor of taking small bite-size
chunks from the market, your entire market outlook evolves.

This book has been an unparalleled journey into how professional
traders approach the market and deal with the risk of loss. The in
formation throughout these chapters has been broken down into ba
sic and advanced strategies to highlight the differences between concepts
that are solely designed to manage risk and ideas designed to also generate
income. By themselves the basic and advanced concepts presented here
are not inherently more difficult from one another. Nor are the basic and
advanced strategies really required to be operated on their own.
As you have probably learned, in reading through the various chapters,
it takes only small changes to convert one strategy into another. If you were
to add an out-of-the-money option to a futures or spot position, you could
create a hedge. To make another change only requires that you turn an out
of-the-money option into an at-the-money option and tie it to a futures or
spot position to make a synthetic put or call option. It simply requires the
willingness to sell an option and purchase an option with the same contract
month to create a synthetic futures. If you sell one option and purchase two
options slightly out-of-the-money, then all of a sudden you have a type of
ratio spread.
Subtle changes and modifications to a position can make it morph into
an entirely different trade altogether. By being open to combining the basic
strategies in this book along with the advanced strategies that you learned,
you have the ability to manipulate the markets, even if you are losing.

218 ADVANCED STRATEGIES
In the face of a losing trade, the majority of retail traders either freeze
up or head for the hills. Those who do exit their losing positions do so with
their emotions. It is important to know that whether it is the same moment
that they exit their losing trade or days later, the simple fact that they can
take the loss at all is a testament to their trading maturity. It is a far better
solution than freezing up in the face of adversity.
Professional traders do not look at taking a loss the same way as retail
traders do. Often professional traders think in terms of how to manipulate
the losing trade into an opportunity to profit. Whether they convert a trade
into another form, such as an option hedge into a synthetic option, or they
unwind an advanced trade, such as a collar into a ratio spread, they are
looking for a way to put the odds of success back in their favor. With that
being said, for the majority of retail traders simply closing out a losing trade
is most likely the intelligent way to approach loss. Don't stop doing that.
Taking a loss gives you a chance to take a break from the market and
come back to it with fresh eyes. You can review your technical analysis
as well as determine whether there has been a fundamental shift in the
supply and demand of the currencies or futures you are currently trading.
When you have only a finite amount of capital available to you, closing out
your losing trades is simply the most prudent thing to do, nine times out
often.
The decision to combine strategies or morph one strategy into another
strategy should occur only that tenth time-that one time when you know
for a fact that your technical analysis signals have pegged the market's
reversal or your original assessment is simply experiencing a setback. You
can see the shift in the market and you can tell that it only requires that you
make one or two changes to your approach in order to be successful over
the long run.
That is what this chapter is about. We will look at five different sce
narios and ask ourselves up to three questions: Should we hold on to the
trade, should we walk away from the trade, or should we convert the trade?
For each one of our choices we will look at our risk and reward profile to
determine what makes the most sense for our goals.
The examples in this chapter are designed to show you that no matter
what the situation is, you can manipulate anyone of these strategies to
give yourself the best opportunity for success, even if that means exiting
the trade altogether.
Analyze the charts and see how the various trades can flow from one
scenario to the next. Eventually you will see the lines of opportunity and be
able to manipulate the various strategies accordingly. There are no hard
and-fast rules to trading with risk management strategies; as long as you
keep your mind flexible to the market's behavior, you will be able convert
from one strategy to the next with ease.

MANIPULATING THE STRATEGIES
In the following five examples, charts that were presented in various chap
ters throughout the book will be reintroduced. In each example we look at
how an initial trade can be modified into another trade, either through ne
cessity or because of a change of circumstance. The ability to fluidly react
to the market is an essential skill for long-term success.
There are many reasons why you may want to interact with the mar
ket differently than you set out to do. Professional traders use a myriad of
techniques in order to effect that change. The following are just a few ways
to manipulate and modify trades from their original intent.
Example 1: Collar Trade into Bull Call Spread
In Chapter 7 we took an extensive look at long and short collar trading. A
collar is a position that caps off your losses with an option that you pur
chase, and the cost of the option is partially offset by an out-of-the-money
option that you sell. The potential to profit is capped between the strike
price of the protective option and the sold out-of-the-money option.
Figure 14.1 is a classic example of a collar setup in the euro.

220 ADVANCED STRATEGIES
In this example the euro has a well-defined support line at the $1.2100
price level. Looking at the same chart, we can see that the euro moved
up to $1.2680 and collapsed soon after gapping up in price. Collapsing af
ter the gap shows the development of a decent point of resistance. If the
euro does begin to move up again, then it has to look forward to facing
resistance at the $1.2680 level once again. This is the perfect place for
the market to pull back if it fails to develop enough momentum to break
through.
At the same time, this market has been generally unpredictable. A lot
of downward pressure has developed over the course of just 14 days. Four
teen days after the market hit the $1.2680 price it has collapsed back down
to the $1.2lO0 price level, eventually creating a candlestick formation at
$1.2195 called a doji. A doji pattern is consIdered a straightforward rever
sal signal. Since it has formed at $1.2195 area, we are given a buy signal to
act on.
The doji could just represent a small turnaround signal, indicating the
beginning of a retracement, not necessarily a shift in the overall buying
pressure of the euro itself. With this understanding, it's only logical that a
collar be put on.
To successfully put on the collar for this chart, we have to take
three distinct actions. We have to purchase a put option at or near the
money. With the price of the euro futures at $1.2195, we have an oppor
tunity to buy an option at $1.2200, $1.2150, or $1.2100. For this example
we look for the support line that can protect us for the least amount of
expense. We choose a strike price of $1.21. While the doji pattern sug
gests that the market can move up, our goal is to insure ourselves against
any downward pressure that the euro may suddenly experience. Based
on the technical analysis, the euro has the ability to drop suddenly in
the same aggressive fashion as it did when it failed to break $1.2700 the
first time.
A combination of the doji pattern, support near $1.22, and resistance
near $1.27 gives us a potential setup for a decent collar trade. There is no
guarantee that the doji pattern will signal a market reversal that has enough
momentum to break through the most recent high of 14 days ago. With two
what-if scenarios possible, a collar trade can allow a trader to get the best
of both worlds.
Figure 14.2 shows the conclusion of the euro's move and the impact
that it has on the established collar trade.
The doji was a good signal and the euro does move upward. It spends a
total of two months attempting to get back and break through the $1.2680
resistance level. The $1.2680 high gets blasted through as the euro heads
on to make new record highs at the time. So while the doji was right about
the market's upward movement, the resistance level can't hold and affects

the ultimate fate of our collar trade negatively. By putting on a collar, we
are forced into a tough set of decisions that literally make us pay for our
mistake.
The call option that we sold caps off our profits at the $1.2680 level.
That means that we entirely miss out on the 4 cent move from $1.27 to
$1.31. With each 1 cent move equal to $1,250, this is a total opportunity
cost of $5,000. While one of the cardinal rules of trading dictates that we
shouldn't fixate on missed moneymaking opportunities, in this case it can't
help but be noticed that a good amount of potential profits has been left on
the table.
The actual profits that were made from the trade are significant,
though. In this case if you had a long futures contract it would have col
lected profits from $1.22 to $1.27; this would equal $6,250 in profit before
option expenses. If a long spot euro transaction had been put on, the move
would have yielded a profit of $5,000 (a $100,000 contract represents that
every 1 cent move or 100-pip move equals $1,000).
In the face of leaving an additional $5,000 ($1.27 to $1.31) in poten
tial futures contract profits on the table, a collar trade leaves a trader few
choices on how to react to the market. The collar trade can be held until
it reaches expiration, it can be exited immediately, or it can be converted
into another type of trade entirely.



==================================================
                     PAGE 236                     
==================================================

222 ADVANCED STRATEGIES
Let's break down the choices to determine which scenario is the best.
Hold It In Chapter 4 the "hold it" option of the collar was explored. Ta
ble 14.1 shows that, by holding the option until expiration, you are able to
collect your futures profits of $6,312.50. The protective put expires worth
less, so you lose $2,100. This brings your profits down to $4,212.50. The
call that you sold doesn't break even until $1.2772. In this scenario we
will assume that the option expires before it can reach breakeven for the
buyer. This leaves you a profit on the sold option of $900 for a net profit of
$5,112.50.
Risk This trade exposes the trader to two, significant risks. First, by hold
ing on to a collar until expiration, a trader is exposed to multiple ups and
downs in the market, without the guarantee that the underlying futures
contract will actually reach the resistance level where the call option was
sold. The call option's premium may not be enough to make up for the
lack of momentum of the underlying futures contract and the amount of
premium that was paid to put on the protective put.
The second risk is the potential that the sold option does move past the
breakeven point and is exercised by the option buyer. The $900 in premium
that was originally collected is removed from the balance sheet, and the
maximum profit that can be achieved on the entire trade is $4,212.50.
With the uncertainty of the outcome of holding on to the collar trade
until expiration looming over a trader, along with the missed profit oppor
tunity, there are few viable alternatives. The trader can either walk away
from the collar trade by selling it off or use a bull call spread to modify and
extend the life of the trade.
Walk Away Taking the same chart, this is what would happen if a trader
decided not to hold on to the collar until expiration. On the chart the euro
gives the trader an opportunity to get out of the trade before the options
contracts reach expiration. In this instance the euro futures contract is

exited as soon as it hits $1.27. At 1.27 the futures contract is profitable.
making a total of $6,312.50.
The protective put is exited as well. While the protective put has no real
intrinsic value, there is a little time value left, so there is an opportunity to
collect $475 by selling the put back into the marketplace. This leaves the
trader with a total loss on the put of $1,625. The trader also decides to buy
the call option back. Even though the call is not fully in-the-money, it has
increased in value. This forces the trader to buy back the call at its current
at-the-market value of $2,675. This leaves a net loss on the call of $1,775
(see Table 14.2).
This brings the net profits on the trade down to $2,912.50; this is a far
cry from the profits that would have accumulated had the trader simply
decided to go long the futures contract ($6,312.50), and $1,300 less than
holding the collar trade until expiration ($4,212.50).
Risk By just collecting $2,912.50, profits are diminished compared to the
other potential trading scenarios, but it may make the most sense because
of how the market is behaving at the time. What should dictate your trad
ing decisions is your market bias. In this case the decision was to go long
the futures market. By making the decision to go long, the trader must
stay focused on how the long position behaves or doesn't behave. This is
how profits are made, by paying attention to what is affecting the futures
position.
If the futures position begins to weaken in value but doesn't drop far,
how does that affect your profit potential? If the market finally hits your
target goal, does it really make sense to continue to hold the protective
option contracts unnecessarily?
There are two potential scenarios:
The first scenario involves the trade hitting the price target of $1.27 and
pulling back, never to come back to $1.27 again. This has the potential of
ending up to be a giant goose egg for a trader if he is not careful.

==================================================

224 ADVANCED STRATEGIES
So even if the futures contract is profitable, the overall position is
weak. Let's suppose the market pulls back and stays around $1.2445. This
has the potential to produce a futures profit of $3,156.25. Let's take it one
step further and let the market end at that price as the options expire.
You would lose $2,100 on the protective put you bought. Subtract your
futures profits from your put option losses, and you are left with $1,056.25
in profits.
Add to that the collected premium of $900 from the call you sold, and
you end up with $1,956.25. That's a $1,000 difference from just exiting once
your profit target of $1.27 is hit. If the futures market were to drop any
lower than 50 percent of the total value, it quickly becomes apparent that
the amount you are risking isn't worth the reward.
If this scenario were to occur independently, never actually reaching
the $1.27 target price, that would be is okay; but if the market were to hit
$1.27 and you didn't take advantage of it, then you would have created an
unnecessary opportunity cost.
The second potential scenario would require the trader to leg out of the
position. When legging out the position, the goal is to exit each of the in
dividual components of the trade independently as it becomes profitable.
By legging out of a trading position, the trader is exposed to a lot of un
necessary risk. In fact, if the market moves against any leg of the position
there would be significantly more trouble involved compared to the poten
tial profit collected.
For instance, if a trader decides to collect the profits from the long
futures position ($6,312.50), but decides to stay in the options, there are
two situations that could come from doing this. The first one could be a
loser, but the second one could be profitable. Unfortunately, there is no
way to predict which one will occur with 100 percent certainty.
First, as long as the futures market stays at the $1.27 area it can actually
break through $1.27 and drive the sold call up in value. Without a futures
contract protecting the sold call, the call is exposed to unlimited risk. A
few cents of movement above $1.27 could wipe out all of the profits that
the long futures position has accumulated and then some. This makes the
premium that was collected for selling the call a liability as opposed to
being an asset.
If the euro breaks through the $1.27 price level, the put option that
was bought for thousands of dollars will definitely expire worthless. This
will compound the position's overall losses. The money from the sold call
will evaporate as prices increase in value, and you will lose the premium
you paid on the option. This is completely counter to the original intent of
the collar.
The second scenario that could evolve, the only one that could po
tentially work in favor of legging out of this position, is for the market to

==================================================

Retreat, Recovery, Opportunity 225
collapse in value by breaking the support level of $1.22. This would in
crease the value of the put option, and allow the sold call to expire worth
less so you can collect the premium.
The likelihood that the second scenario will occur is small. The fact
that the futures position was exited with a profit means the momentum of
the market is on the long side. A trader will be forced to wait and hope
for the market to move in the short direction. In the meantime there "'ill
be a constant fear of losing the premium that was paid and being nakedly
exposed to the unlimited risk of a sold call option.
Ne ither scenario is a healthy way to trade. Walking away from the trade
makes for the best option in this instance. Yet, there is a third opportunity
available. There is an opportunity to convert the trade from a collar trade
into something else, a bull call spread.
Convert A bull call spread is the purchase of an at-the-money option
and the sale of an out-of-the-money option. You profit from the difference
between the two strike prices. The fact that you have to spend money to
purchase an option creates a debit in your account, which gives this type
of transaction its second name, bull call debit spread.

226 ADVANCED STRATEGIES
This time we see that the euro has rallied up to $1.25 after gapping
down. With no foreknowledge of where the euro's price will eventually end
up, we see an out from our collar trade. On March 13, 2008, the candlestick
pattern "hanging man" forms on the euro chart. After the most recent mar
ket collapse, this does not bode well for the euro. In fact, this a clear signal
that the market can reverse.
Seeing an overall bullish bias for the euro market, yet at the same time
not wanting to see the futures contract's profits erode for our collar trade,
we unwind the trade and replace it with a default bull call spread.
In Table 14.3, the long futures contract is exited and $3,812.50 in profits
are collected. The protective put is exited with only a $600 loss. If the $900
in collected premiums is added, then there is a total net profit of $4,112.50.
That gives a trader enough capital to purchase an at-the-money option at
the exact same exit price of the futures contract; or the market can be al
lowed to pull back as low as it can go before reentering the euro with a call.
In Figure 14.4 we see the euro take off and not only hit the $1.27 target,
but exceed it, getting up to $1.29. Had we stayed in the futures position,
we would have made $2,225, but at the same time we would have risked a
pullback to $1.23 before we could have achieved that.
As always, hindsight is 20/20, so while we were trading we had no idea
if the market would rebound, and there were few clues that would have
alerted us to this potential outcome. Therefore, the risks involved with tak
ing such a bold move have to be assessed.
Risk There is no guarantee that the $1,912.50 in profits made from the pur
chase of the 1.25 option would have occurred. In fact, there were two sce
narios that had the potential to happen from this conversion to a bull call
spread.
The first scenario is to purchase the at-the-money option for $2,975.
In doing that there is exposure to the risk that the market will pull back

If an at-the-money option is executed, then a total of $1 ,912 in profits will be
added to the original $4,112.50 profit, giving a grand total of $6,024.50.

(like it did) and erode all of the paid premium. While there is the ability to
exit the option to diminish losses and repurchase an option with a lower
strike price, it would be better to exit the market altogether instead of chas
ing the market.
Since no one knows if the market will rebound, the smart thing to do
is to not risk more than the premium collected from the sold option; in this
instance that would be $900.
The second scenario is what did evolve for this trade; the market pulled
back, and then rebounded. The trader held on to the option, and the oppor
tunity to potentially earn $1,912 came about. This was just a $300 difference
from staying in the futures co"ntract and collecting $2,225. The trader didn't
have to commit any margin capital to the keep the trade going, nor did
he have to give up all of the profits originally accumulated in the futures
contract in hopes that the market would rebound.
Comparison of Different Potential Returns In the table that fol
lows we see the ideal situations: Had we held the trade, we would have
had the potential to make over $5,000. Had we simply walked away from
the trade by exiting everything at the first sign of a pullback, there was the
potential to walk away with a little under $3,000. Finally, if the trade was

converted into a bull call spread and the market continued to move up,
there was the potential to pick up a little over $6,000.
Hold it $5,112.50
Walk away $2,912
Bull call spread $6,024.12
The questions that a trader has to ask are:
"Is an extra thousand dollars worth the risk of converting the trade
from a collar into a bull call spread?"
"Would I have been better off simply holding on to the collar?"
"What if the market had gone the other way- could I live with my
decisions?"
The reason why these strategies exist is to help diminish risk. The mar
ket will dictate your trading behavior. It is difficult to say what is exactly
right or what is exactly wrong when it comes to trading, solely because we
work with imperfect knowledge.
The information we see on the screen is our best indicator of what
is happening. Even after you have the right tools for success, there is no
guarantee that you will always be successful. Keep that in mind as you
attempt to trade these and any other strategies in your arsenal.
Example 2: Collar Trade into Ratio Backspread
In Figure 14.5 a put collar position is placed on com futures. Using the
indicators discussed in Winning the Trading Game, we wait for the can
dlestick indicator "spinning top" to show up. Based on the candlestick for
mation, we enter the market by going short and protect ourselves with a
$5.10 call while simultaneously selling a $4.30 put to cover part of the call
option's at-the-money premium costs.
There are three potential scenarios for this collar position: We can hold
it until expiration, we can walk away from the trade once our target price
has been hit, or we can convert it. In the preceding example we converted
the collar trade into a bull call spread. In this example we will convert the
collar into a ratio spread, also known as a call backspread.
A standard definition of a ratio spread can be found on Investopedia as
"an options strategy in which an investor simultaneously holds an unequal
number of long and short positions. A commonly used ratio is two short
options for every option purchased." Therefore, depending on whom you

talk to, by purchasing more options than you sell you are essentially in
what is known as a call backspread or a ratio backspread.
The key difference is that a standard ratio spread exposes you to unlim
ited risk, because you have an extra short position, whereas a ratio back
spread exposes you to unlimited profit potential, because you have an extra
long position. Regardless of the technicality of the name, selling one option
and buying two options is less risky than buying one option and selling two
options. Therefore, you always want to do the former, not the latter, if your
goal is to manage your risk.
Hold It In the example found in Table 14.4, all of the indicators are
pointing toward shorting the com market. Placing a protective call at $5.10

protects the position from any sudden moves to the upside. The call costs
$1,000. To offset the costs of the call option, a put can be sold at a point of
support, $4.30. The sold put brings in $250 of premium.
Simply holding on to the trade until it reaches expiration results in a
$1,000 deduction from the profits. The call option expires worthless, leav
ing $3,000 in profits. The sold put has to reach $4.25 before it can be con
sidered profitable (determined by subtracting the strike price from the pre
mium collected), and even if it gets that low, the short futures position can
end up covering your losses. A simple profit of $3,000 can be achieved if
the trade is held on to with little fanfare.
Risk The risk for this collar is no different-from the risk associated with
the first example. Holding on to a collar until expiration exposes the po
sition to multiple ups and downs in price as the market fluctuates. This
occurs without the guarantee that the underlying futures position will ac
tually ever reach the resistance level where the put was sold. Any lack of
momentum on the part of the underlying futures contract will diminish the
impact of the sold put. By itself the sold option cannot produce a signifi
cant source of revenue to cover the call that was bought, nor will it make
up for the futures contract's disappointing results. This leaves the trader
with a maximum opportunity to gain $3,000 while at the same time leaving
the trader open to making a lot less.
Walk Away If the market is moving in the right direction but there is no
desire to hold on to the trade until expiration, then the trade can be liqui
dated early. When we look at Table 14.5 we can see that the market has hit
the $4.30 level, but it simply cannot break through the $4.10 level. Tremen
dous support has built up in the $4.30 to $4.10 range with the potential for
the market to tum around and go up at any given time.
With the threat of that occurring, it may be best to exit the trade with
out waiting until expiration.

Risk Exiting the trade before expiration entails two additional costs as
sociated with the trade, both of which will drag down the profits. First, by
exiting the protective call you will be penalized. While you do not lose your
entire call premium of $1,000, there is the potential that this can occur. In
this example you end up losing $850.
The same problem arises for the sold put. The put has to be bought
back at the market's going rate. You initially collected a premium of $250,
but you now have to pay $700 in order to get out of the position-making
your put loss $450. This gives your com position a total loss of $1,300
against a backdrop profit of $4,000. This leaves the com position with a
net profit $2,700.
Convert It The decision to put on a ratio spread can be difficult. There
may be a feeling that the market will continue downward, but you don't
want to expose your profits to any pullbacks, nor do you want to lock your
self out of any future short profits solely because you sold a put.
That is when the ratio spread comes in. If we look at Figure 14.6 we can
see the nascent beginnings of converting from a collar to a ratio spread.

==================================================

232 ADVANCED STRATEGIES
Since there is a new area of support developing around the $4.10 level,
we decide to take a portion of the profits and reinvest them into purchasing
two puts. The intent is get all of our short futures profits locked into our
account, while at the same time avoiding taking a loss on the put that
we sold.
By holding on to the short futures position until it reaches $4.10 we
eke out an additional thousand dollars, bringing our futures total to $5,000.
By doing this we make sure that any potential losses incurred by the put
we sold are covered between $4.30 and $4.10. It also gives us a little more
capital to purchase the two put options at $4.10.
One put option continues to cover the put we sold, diminish our un
limited risk, and let us get out of our futures position. The second put is
our moneymaker. For $900 we get to free up the equity in our account by
eliminating corn's margin requirements, yet still participate in the drop in
price and any potential chance at collecting the premium.
In Table 14.6 we see the trade fully exited: no call, no puts, sold or
bought. The time it takes to get to that point is almost four months. This is
definitely a position trade.
Risk There are a number of drawbacks in converting from the collar to
this type of ratio spread. The first problem is the number of variables that
you have to contend with leading up to the final execution of the short fu
tures trade. If you hold on to the short futures position too long, the market
has the opportunity to rebound on you and take back your profits.
A second problem arises in purchasing the additional two puts. While
slightly out-of-the-money, they have the ability to be quite expensive com
pared to the premium you collected from the put. In fact, the expense may
far outweigh the benefits of continuing the trade.
Finally, a trade that originally took only 26 days to profit now takes 103
days before you get all of your money, and the whole time you are not sure

whether the trade will work. This is almost a quadrupling of your trading
time frame with little guarantee that the market will continue down. If the
market were to move against your two puts, you would lose the $1,100 in
premium. This risk simply may not be worth it. That's why it is important
to do your math before you execute a trade like this.
Comparison of Different Potential Returns In 26 days or less you
can walk away from the trade with a simple profit of $2,700 or you can
simply hold on to the trade with little to no change and collect $3,000. Al
though you have an opportunity to make extra money in putting on a ratio
spread, it doesn't necessarily mean that it always must be done. Depending
on the circumstances, it may be better to take your profits as soon as pos
sible. This can only be determined by the individual trader who is looking
to hold on for longer time frames.

Walk away $2,700

Example 3: Short Strangle into
a Synthetic Futures
In Chapter 14 we looked at the S&P 500 and used it as an example for a
short strangle. We sold an S&P 5001400 call for $1,250 and we sold an S&P
500 1325 put for $2,250. We collected a total of $3,500 in initial premiums.
As the trade evolved we ended up losing money on our 1325 put, $250, and
picking up a small profit of $950 on the trade overall (see Table 14.7).
In Chapter 14 we thoroughly looked at the unlimited risk exposure
that short strangles have, along with the consequences of holding on to
the trade too long and exiting the trade early. What wasn't explored was

the ability to convert the trade from an unlimited risky investment into a
synthetic futures position.
In Chapter 13 we defined synthetic futures as a position that combines
a short option position with a long option position. In this case we want to
collect the premium on our call, the losing position, and buy a put option
to catch the market's move down.
In Figure 14.7 we see the original position where we sell the call at
1400 and we sell the put at 1325. The market breaks past the 1325 target
put price and has to be exited. A trader has to ask the question, "Why wait
until it breaks past the 1325 level before exiting?" As the market moves up
to 1400 and stalls out, only to collapse later, why can't you exit near the
top, and attempt to collect as much premium as possible?
The reality is that nothing is stopping 'you from taking your signals
early. There is no unwritten rule that says that you have to hold on to the
sold option (put in this instance) until the market has broken through the
support or resistance line.
Convert It In Figure 14.8 we can clearly see the market has stalled out
near the top, in the 1390 area. Not only is this confirmed by the price stalling

out, but three indicators are backing it up. The upper Bollinger band, the
50-day moving average, and the RSI are all screaming "overbought." This is
the absolute end of the road for the rally in this market.
With all three indicators pointing downward, there is the ability to
catch a profit on the sold option, then short the market to ride the market
back down. In this instance the premium can be retained as a profit from
the sold call. This particular conversion gives you three different sources
of income from the execution of one trade (see Table 14.8).
Risk This is not without its own problems. You are now nakedly exposed
to the markets, with the potential of unlinlited loss as well as unlimited
gain. If the market flips around on you and shoots past 1400, you will

need to have some type of protective setup in place. This will require ei
ther a stop or another option, and you will have to react for both the los
ing short position and the losing sold call. This is important to keep in
mind.
Comparison of Different Potential Returns
Short strangle $950
Synthetic futures (Emini position) $8,590
The question that you must ask yourself is: "Is the potential, in this
instance, to make almost 10 times as much,'with all of the associated risk,
worth the effort?"
If not, you must ignore the ability to convert the trade. If it is worth
it, you have to take advantage of the signals immediately. If this type of
trading dovetails directly with your ultimate trading goal and your temper
ament, it could be successful.
If you are going for slow and steady, then the simple income genera
tion of a short strangle is perfect for you. But if you are looking to grab
some outrageous profits every now and then, then you have to execute a
synthetic futures when the opportunity is right.
Example 4: Short Strangle into
a Covered Position
Now let's look at the same example from Chapter 14, but instead of con
verting it into a synthetic futures position, we leave the sold put po
sition on, and we decide to put on a short futures position to cover
any losses. Everything is identical: We sell the call at 1400, we sell
the put at 1325, and when the market stalls out at 1390 we short the
futures.
In Figure 14.9 we see all of the components ofthe trade.
There are only two actions that are different. First, we don't exit
the sold put position; second, we identify a second level of support.
This is our overall target for both the short position and our sold call.
If the market penetrates through this level, 1260, it will be very diffi
cult for the S&P market to turn around and reach the 1400 level anytime
soon.
Convel't It There is no easy explanation on why you would want to con
vert a short strangle into a covered position. Unlike stocks that you may
own for years on end, a futures contract is a finite instrument that can

be exited at any time. The only reason to convert a short strangle into a
covered position is if you sincerely believe that a market will rebound and
that it would be a mistake to give up the premium you collected because of
a short-term retracement.
In the S&P 500 example, all of the indicators have lined up to show us
that the longs have stalled out at 1390. By putting on a short futures posi
tion, we are able to capture the drop. Initially there may be no expectation
for the market to penetrate the 1325 area; in fact, it would be ideal if it
didn't. You could simply pic~ up profits between 1390 and 1325 (approx
imately $3,200 for an Emini S&P contract) and collect the premiums for
both the sold option positions.
In Figure 14.10 we see that the market breaks through the 1325 area
and eventually rebounds off of the second support line at 1260. This
leads to the S&P 500 making a rally and eventually breaking through the
1400 level.
A fast-moving market can thwart your plans from catching the profits
that build up in a sideways-moving market. In this case there were three
up days before the S&P 500 slammed through 1325 and had three down
days in a row. This would have given any trader little time to react and to
exit the sideways trade, and would have forced the trade into becoming

a covered position. In this instance, that was not an altogether bad thing
(see Table 14.9).
Risk This position is not without its drawbacks. There is the possibility
that you will diminish your short futures returns because the market never

plus the premium you collected, is given up to the option buyer (for this
example a put buyer) once the option is exercised.
There is also the possibility that you will put on a covered fu

This position just happened to work out. It was picked at random and
the market operated in conjunction with the technical analysis, making
each leg of the opportlmity profitable. This is the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.
As you trade you will have to make tough decisions. These decisions may
drive you out of the market ahead of time, may make you second-guess
yourself when it's time to put on trades, and may stop you from exiting a
market when you know you have to. The reason for this example, along
with all of the other examples in the book, is to show you what is possible
when you apply these techniques. In the end all that matters is that you are
prepared for the opportunities.
Example 5: Option Hedge into a Collar Position
In Chapter 6 we introduced options as an alternative to using a stop loss.
The goal was to show the difference between a pure synthetic option, an
at-the-money option and a futures position versus an option hedge, and an
out-of-the-money option and a futures position.
Using an option as a hedge is a great way to lock in your money man
agement strategy. But what nappens if the market stalls out as it is heading
in the direction of your underlying futures contract? You can exit the trade
completely like we did in Chapter 6 or you can sell an option at or near
the apex or the low and collect a premium. This will convert your position
into a collar position and by default (if you don't exit the underlying futures
contract) a covered option position.
We take an example from Chapter 6 and look at it more closely. In
Figure 14.11 we have gold futures set up. Overall the market is bullish- it's
above the 50-day MA. It has pulled back to a previous high, $860, which
has become a short-term point of support. By purchasing gold on its
way up, we get a fill at $883. If we had attempted to put on a synthetic

option, an $885 put would have cost us $1,470, whereas a $860 put costs
only $300.
The difference between $860 and $883 is $23 or $2,300. With a stop
loss at $500,5 percent of a $10,000 account, we have only $800 committed
to our potential loss instead of $1,470. This decreases how much money
we are paying for the intrinsic value of the option, particularly because we
are only looking to diminish our loss and we are unambiguous about the
market's direction (see Table 14.10).
Convert It In Figure 14.12 we see the market move up in value, only to
collapse unexpectedly at $950.
With gold reaching unexplored territory, it is impossible to predict
what height the gold contract could reach. It could go as high as $2,000
per ounce, but without any precedence at these lofty levels gold has

developed intense volatility. This volatility struck on February 1, 2008,
when gold dropped $30 in one day.
So while the gold market itself is still in a bull market, individual daily
fluctuations cannot be ignored. In this instance we lose over $3,000 in profit
form our futures position. The hope is that the market will retrace, but
there is no guarantee. To make up for part of the losses, we sell a call at
$945 for $620 in premium. This converts our position into a collar. Our
put option is paid for, and we get an additional $320 to cover some of our
losses.
We are still optimistic that the market will rebound; we just don't know
when. In Figure 14.12 the market not only rebounds, but it exceeds $945.
Our futures position returns $6,200 and we lose both the put and call pre
miums of $920 (see Table 14.11).

The only reason we employ this strategy is so we can cover the cost
of the put option, just in case our $500 stop loss is hit. The extra $320 will
diminish our $500 stop loss to only $180. This is important, because while
we may lose our profits on our futures position, we have set ourselves up
for success on our put, and our account's principal of $10,000 is preserved.
Our stop loss goes from 5 percent to only 1.8 percent.
If the market rebounds, as it did in this case, our option is paid for if
the market doesn't exceed $951.20 (strike price plus premium); but if the
market does exceed it, our original futures position is profitable enough
to cover the $920 loss (cost of put and return of call premium), plus any
exercise of the call will be covered by the futures position itself.
-
Risk This type of conversion has few drawbacks. As with any collar trade,
you will have to give up any of your futures contract profits that exceed
the sold option's strike price. The put premiun1 will be lost to you if your
futures position is successful, plus your profit opportunity will be stuck
between where you place both of your options.
~ON~LUSION
Whether you are converting a collar trade into a ratio spread or you are
selling options, your success is not because of how smart or clever you
are; it is based on how well you follow the rhythms of the market. If the
rhythm of the market dictates you can switch your original position or you
can add onto your position, then do so without hesitation. If the rhythm of
the market dictates that you exit a trade, then you must exit without hesi
tation. The worst actions that can be taken are to force a trade to become
something it is not or to give up too early.
This chapter was designed to highlight just a few of the different types
of conversions that are possible as you blend advanced and basic strate
gies together. In no way is this a comprehensive list of all of the different
scenarios and possibilities. I could write an entire new book devoted just
to that. This chapter is designed to highlight the fact that as you become
comfortable with calculating your profit and loss potentials ahead of time,
you give yourself the ability to trade in such a way that you can prepare for
multiple opportunities while you are in the same trade.

Analyzing Charts
and Strategies
s
o much information has been given throughout this book that it might
be overwhelming to get started. This chapter is meant to help you
settle in and get used to playing around with the concepts of risk
management. This cannot replace real world trading, but it can supplement
your education.
The next several examples take a look at the five markets that we have
been consistently reviewing. There are two charts for each example. The
before chart has no teclmical analysis indicators and is representative of
the trade setup. The after chart is overlaid with technical analysis informa
tion and shows where the market ended up. This setup encourages you to
think critically about how you could have approached the markets using
anyone of the fifteen strategies in the book. I suggest that you photocopy
and enlarge the charts so you can write on them.
The only rules that are associated with each of these charts is that you
write up your risk/reward scenario based on particular capital constraints
and the option prices presented to you. There aren't right or wrong an
swers. I then discuss how I would have approached the market, based on
the same information.
Every trade you execute should undergo the same type of scrutiny.
By taking the time to analyze the market, even if you are an active trader,
you can create a myriad of possibilities for yourself. This type of critical
approach prevents your capital from being unnecessarily lost. It also sets
the stage for a more cerebral approach to the markets. Since our emotions
of fear and greed tend to wreak havoc on our trading decisions, the more
ways we have to cope with them the better off we are.
Let's begin.

S&P 500
There are two S&P 500 futures contracts. There is the full-size contract
with a margin that can exceed $20,000 on any given day, depending on the
volatility, and there is the Emini S&P 500 with a margin that hovers around
$4,000. The Emini S&P 500 is therefore about one-fifth the size of a full-size
contract. If you had a small account valued at $15,000, how would you in
teract with the following scenario? Would you use an option? How many?
What if you wanted to trade the full-size contract-would a synthetic fu
tures contract make sense?
Before
In Figure 15.1 it's obvious that the market has topped out. For those clas
sical chartists, we have either a triple top or a head and shoulders pattern
forming. How would you approach the market if you were assuming that
the market was headed for some weakness?
Considering the option values in Tables 15.1 and 15.2, would it be
worthwhile to put on a collar, a synthetic, or a bear put spread?

We can't determine by looking at the chart whether the market will
flip around and go back up, nor do we have a lot of fundamental data that
helps us make sense of the activity at the time. Nevertheless, two things
are staring us in the face: the market seems to be at a top, and there is a
double line of support around the 1525 price area.
If we were to execute a trade by shorting at 1575 and it reached the
1525 level, how much could be made? On a full-sized contract we make
$12,500, and on a mini-contract we make one-fifth that or $2,500. Would
this be a worthwhile risk?
After
In Figure 15.2, not only did the S&P drop, it broke through the 1525 level
and kept going, causing new lows as far down as 1400 and 1425. In hind
sight a synthetic option would have been the perfect vehicle; there would
have been no capping of profits.
At the same time you have to ask yourself what if it had not kept going
down? Would you be prepared to give the gains you made? Would a collar
have worked just as well to cap off the risk of the market turning back
on you?
In trading there is the constant second-guessing of both your decision
making process and your methodology. I would steer well clear of anyone
who trades as if they are invincible. There will always be better ways you
could have tackled a trade. The only thought you have to keep in your mind
is that you acted 100 percent right based on the information you had at the

EURO
The euro currency trades in so many forms that it should actually have its
own exchange, There is the euro cash market, for those with a lot of money,
There is the euro spot market, for those who want to trade as if they have
a lot of money. There is the euro futures market, for those who think they
have a lot of money, There is the euro ETF, for those who believe they are
nothing like the rest of the euro traders. Finally there is the euro options
market, for those who wish they had a lot of money. And then there are
the cross-currency euro contracts that have no relationship to the dollar:
euro/yen, GBP/euro, euro/aud, etc.
The reality is that all these traders, no matter their market or exchange,
are affected the exact same way, by the exact same charts, by the exact
same news. While each one gains profits at varying levels and rates, and

pay different types of commissions or spreads, at the end of the day long is
long and short is short.
The artificial boundaries set between these various sectors of euro
trading, and on a larger scale forex trading altogether, is fluidly traversed by
professional traders looking for arbitrage opportunities. The imperfect sys
tem of having so many different products coming to bear on one currency
exposes the absurdity of the situation. Nimble minds and nimble fingers
are able to exploit these razor-thin discrepancies or at the very least ap
ply their skill across the myriad of exchanges that are all trading the same
instrument.
The following example is from the futures euro trading screen. It could
have just as well been the forex euro screen, the cash euro screen, or the
Emini euro screen.
Before
In Figure 15.3 we see the spot currency traded euro. It has recently gapped
up and seems to be poised for a pullback. As a spot trader you are caught
on a 24-hour timetable, so regardless of what the trend is, you typically find
yourself forced to exit the market when faced with this kind of volatility.

What do you do to hold on to this trade? Do you believe this is the beginning
of a much larger rally, or do you look to first catch any pullback in price?
There are a few choices available. A spot forex trader could decide to
use an option as a hedge technique. For the most part, the trend seems to be
long, but there is the possibility that a counter-trend is forming a possible
short. There is also the possibility of creating a synthetic call option by
purchasing a put at-the-money and riding the spot long.
After
In Figure 15.4 it can easily be seen that the gap up was the beginning of
unprecedented price levels in the euro.
With the right tools in place, there was a tremendous profit opportu
nity. The success of a trader comes from his ability to take his nose off the
canvas and look at the big picture. Since the euro's inception it has been a
powerhouse of value in one direction-up. From its humble origins of be
ing valued at less than a dollar to reaching parity to eventually outstripping
the dollar for years.
This meteoric rise cannot last forever. Therefore, a systematic ap
proach should be in place to manage both upside and downside risk for
years to corne. A sudden drop in price could start with an innocently small

marketplace or one exchange are a necessary component for anyone who
hopes to succeed in the long run with forex trading.
GOLD
The use of gold as a storehouse of value has been around since ancient
times and most likely will still be around when the book you hold in your
hands crumbles to dust. That being the case, approaching gold investing
intelligently is paramount to any trader's success. Failing to recognize the
winds of change will most assuredly have you holding the bag when gold
is no longer fashionable and missing out when it is.
Before
In Figure 15.5 we see gold attempting to reclaim territory by trying to break
through resistance at former highs.
Can gold do it? The candlestick makes it appear as if gold may actually
tum around. From an inverted hammer at the top, to a spinning top, to a

hammer, the candlesticks are reflecting the market's volatility. Couple that
with the collapse of the last rally, and the slow steady pace gold has had to
get back, there is the possibility of a breakout to new highs. With so much
uncertainty, would a straddle at 730 be wise? What about a strangle? Buy
a call at 740 and buy a put at 720, just outside range, but well within the
market's average true range CATR). Would it make sense to sell a naked
put and collect the premium under these circumstances?
In making a decision there are two potentials. If the market moves up,
the next point of resistance is in the 800s and there is the potential to make
$7,000; if the market drops, it apparently has support at 685 that would net
you $4,200. So no matter which way it goes, you should not be risking more
than $2,100 to $3,000. An outright futures co~tract may not make the most
sense.
After
In Figure 15.6 gold drops like a lead balloon. It drops through the 50-day MA
and falls back down to the 685 level of support and begins to tum around.
A strangle, in two ofthe money options, would have probably been the best
bet based on the risk/reward profile.

profit potential of 79 cents or $3,950. A stop loss can be placed at whatever
money management target you may have.
A synthetic call could also work, or a ratio spread could be used to
advantage of this trade for almost free. Whatever the case, it is important
to make sure that a trade like this is not overlooked. Markets that move
sideways for any significant period of time will be explosive, regardless
of the direction. It is best to have all the necessary bases, long and short,
covered in order to corne out on top.

It appears this market did a little bit of both: In Figure 15.8 the market ex

fashion.
The com drop took only four days before it was firmly below the
50-day MA, giving it a bearish trend. Depending on how nimble you are,
you may be out of your primary position with a profit. The most likely out

OIL
Black gold. The twentieth and twenty-first centuries have seen people die,
kill, and lie to possess this commodity. While it has been the back of mod

vironment and our intercontinental relationships. In spite of all that, one
good thing definitely comes from the discovery of oil-the end ofthe killing
of whales for their fat.
Before
Figure 15.9 shows with oil what classic chartists call a triangle formation,
possibly even a pennant or flag.
This formation portends the potential for the market to explode up

be appropriate Or you could use an option as a hedge, or use this setup
to sell puts and collect the premium. If your account can't handle the high
margins that oil requires, then you could create a synthetic futures position
of two options with a third option for protection.
After
In Figure 15.10 we see the flag proved itself and the oil market shot
straight up.
This is a prime example of why paper trading or demo trading can
be frustrating. According to the money management rules in Winning the
Trading Game you would need $30,000 to t~ade one oil contract. There is
always the possibility of trading the mini-oil contract, but it lacks a little
of the same impact. When faced with a margin or capital intensive mar
ket like this and the trade setup looks just right, consider the ways you
can reduce your margin expense. Whether you use a crack spread or put
on a calendar spread to take advantage of contango or backwardation.
Do not give up on figuring out an inexpensive way to participate in the
trade.

Analyzing Charts and Strategies 255
CONCLUSION
By analyzing charts, whether in a paper format like this or in an online
demo account, you have the ability to test your ideas and theories in depth.
They say that practice makes perfect, but it is perfect practice that makes
perfect. As long as you properly apply the principles and ideas you have
learned throughout the book properly in your practice trading, then your
actual trading will become more effective. This puts you leaps and bounds
ahead of the majority of retail traders and that much closer to becoming a
professional trader.

Applying These
Strategies
with Stocks
Throughout this book we have looked at futures and forex transactions
consistently. Yet every strategy, beginner or advanced, can be applied
to the stock market as well. Technical analysis is the same no matter
the market. Unfortunately, many stock investors look at futures and forex
trading and assun1e that there is some magical force working behind the
scenes that makes trading more difficult than stock investing. The truth is
a lot less magnanimous.
The misuse of leverage is the magical force that is misunderstood. The
majority of stock traders believe that they have to use the 20-to-1Ieverage
of futures or the 500-to-1Ieverage of forex in order to trade them, and that
is not the case. Futures and forex can be traded just like stocks. The face
value of a euro contract, U.S. $152,000, as ofthis writing, can be invested in
euros and an investor can make or lose money in a EURIUS contract with
a lot less volatility. The same can be said of a gold futures contract. The
face value of a gold contract is $92,000. An investor can put up the entire
$92,000, eliminating his leverage risk, and just gain or lose on the true value
of gold going up or down.
Because leverage is the key factor that separates futures and forex
trading from stock investing, it stands to reason that the majority of the
other factors will remain the same, such as the daisy-chain effect and the
strategies to exploit it. There are stocks, CFDs, single stock futures, and
options, each one designed to protect the other. If you are holding on to a
long stock position, like 97 percent of all stock traders, then you can pro
tect yourself from a downturn in the stock with a CFD or a single stock
futures position. If you are in a CFD or a single stock futures position, you

could use either of these instruments to protect each other or use a stock
option to protect the CFD, single stock future, or stock position. The me
chanics are identical to the futures and forex market.
In this chapter we take a quick glimpse of a few popular stocks and
how you can apply some of the strategies in the book to them. This chap
ter in no means is meant to be a complete tutorial on stocks. There are a
number of great books out there that will give you an in-depth breakdown
on analyzing a company's value. The goal here is to show you that once
you have come to a decision to be long a stock there are ways to protect
yourself. There is no need to watch your entire net worth evaporate while
you helplessly stand on the sidelines, when there are actual tools that have
been designed to help protect you.
When the dot-com bubble burst, over $Ttrillion of wealth evaporated.
The majority of investors could not afford to take such a loss. Anyone
of the strategies presented in this book could have either diminished their
losses or eliminated their losses altogether, if they had just known they
could do it. Trading is a zero sum game. Someone somewhere collected
the $7 trillion, whether it was the corporations and their venture capitalists
or sophisticated traders on Wall Street utilizing strategies to pick up the
low-hanging fruit. It's time that you learned how to do the same.
STOCKS
Stocks represent ownership in a corporation. The history of stock owner
ship has been dated as far back as ancient Mesopotamia. Today, the trading
of shares in corporations occurs in various parts around the world. From
the famous New York Stock Exchange to the ever-popular Japanese Nikkei
Stock Exchange, stock markets operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week,
in some form or fashion.
While stocks are well-known, there is little about them that is truly
understood. This leaves retail traders vulnerable to many of the stock mar
ket's inherent flaws. First and foremost, stocks are biased by nature. There
are no stock companies that list their shares to raise capital that want to
see the value of their shares drop. This leads to an overall market bias that
encourages stocks be bought but not sold.
There are limitations on shorting stocks; brokers insist on clients' buy
ing shares even when the value of the stocks are decreasing, and any bit
of positive news has the ability to rally a stock. This overall tone has lulled
stock investors into a false sense of security, to the point where companies
like Enron and Wo rldcom can repeatedly tell their employees and share
holders to buy shares while they unload shares out the back door.

Applying These Strategies with Stocks 259
There is a level of sophistication when it comes to trading stocks that
only professional traders are privy to. Proprietary stock-trading houses
lend money to their professional traders far in excess of the 4-to-l lever
age that retail traders may be able to enjoy. Sometimes professional stock
traders enjoy leverage as high as 100-to-l from the prop firms they work
with. Other professional traders are trained on how to short stocks to their
advantage. Professional traders add all these capabilities to their knowl
edge of how to use stock options, single stock futures, and CFDs, and it
quickly becomes apparent that while the industry rhetoric promotes buying
stocks for the retail trader, professionals are doing something altogether
different for themselves behind the scenes.
While you may not be able to enjoy the same leverage that professional
traders experience, that doesn't mean you can't learn a little about how the
various stock derivatives interplay with one another. In this chapter we will
look at stocks, single stock futures, CFDs, and stock options and how you
can intermingle all of them together to get optimum results.
Single Stock Futures
In 2000 the Commodity Futures Modernization Act (CFMA) lifted the ban
on single stock futures and narrow-based security indices (security fu
tures). Foreign countries such as Australia, Denmark, Portugal, and South
Africa had become tremendously successful in offering security futures. At
that time, the United States wanted to catch up with this new investment
vehicle but had to come up with a mandate to unify the fractured regu
latory environment that futures and stocks operated in. With the Internet
economy changing the way people think, security futures were seen as a
way to keep the momentum going. Unfortunately, they were held up for
two years and interest in them waned.
The mechanics of single stock futures (SSFs) is pretty straightforward.
They are standardized contracts between a buyer and a seller to exchange
100 shares of a specific stock in the future. While these contracts do not
represent ownership, they do convey an obligation of physically delivering
shares of a traded company if the contract is not offset before the expi
ration date. Each SSF contract represents 100 shares and has a minimum
movement size of one cent/share that makes a tick worth one dollar ($1.00).
As with any futures contract, SSF traders enjoy the benefits of margin.
The standard margin requirement for all stocks traded as security futures
is 20 percent of the underlying value of the contract (initial and mainte
nance margin). This 20 percent minimum may be reduced for certain types
of futures market positions, such as spread trading. There are also mar
gin reductions for certain offsetting positions in stock options and cash
securities.

ADVANCED STRATEGIES
Contracts for Difference (CFDs)
CFDs were extensively explored in Chapter 2. Developed in the 1990s in
London, they are unique from single stock futures and stock options. They
are an over-the-counter form of stock derivatives. CFDs have no set expira
tion date, unlike stock options and single stock futures. Yet they also enjoy
the benefits of margin. Margin can be as low as 10 percent and as high as
30 percent of the stock's face value.
CFDs are illegal to trade in the United States due to various U.S. regu
lations against OTC stock trading. Since no laws against OTC stock trading
exist in other countries, they are becoming increasingly popular around the
world. A CFD is simply a contract between a buyer and seller where they
agree to pay each other the difference between an asset's current value
and its future value. This concept can be applied to stocks, commodities,
bonds, and so on. As long as there are two counterparties to the transac
tion, a CFD contract can be executed.
Stock Options
Options on stocks are no different from options on futures or forex. They
are contracts that grant the right to buy the underlying asset, but not an
obligation to buy the underlying asset. They can come in two forms, calls or
puts, and they have an agreed-upon strike price and option expiration date
that the buyer and seller agree upon. Stock options are traded in minimum
increments of 100 shares. In 1973, the Chicago Board of Option Exchange
(CBOE) was formed to develop a centralized marketplace for stock option
trading in the United States.
Stock Index Futures
In 1982, nine years after the establishment of a centralized options ex
change, stock index futures were introduced. Two of the most powerful
investment regulatory bodies were pitted against one another. The Secu
rities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which traditionally had oversight
of securities, felt that stock indexes were simply an extension of the stock
market. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the SEC's
futures and commodities counterpart, felt that stock index futures were a
completely new animal under their exclusive domain.
The two most powerful financial agencies in the United States had
to make a compromise. The SEC was granted autonomy over stocks and
stock options, while the CFTC was allowed to regulate stock index futures.
Today there are stock indexes on the Dow Jones, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Rus
sell 2000, and a myriad of foreign stock indexes around the world.

==================================================

Applying These Strategies with Stocks 26.
STRATEGIES
When it comes to the stock market, there are many ways to protect your
trading position. You can purchase a stock that doesn't follow the S&P 500
and short the S&P 500. Single stock futures can be combined with stock
options or stocks to create synthetic or collar opportunities. Stock options
can be matched with CFDs to create hard stop opportunities. Everything
discussed in this book can be applied to the stock market. The following
four examples highlight how to take advantage of stock opportunities using
a synthetic, hard stop, and a collar. These stocks were picked at random
to show that the techniques can be applied in any market regardless of the
industry it's in.
Synthetic
In this example we take a technical analysis look at Alcoa Inc. It's listed
on the New York Stock Exchange and has a single stock future deriva
tive listed on OneChicago. As we have discussed, a synthetic is when you
go long or short a market and purchase an at-the-money (ATM) option
to protect your position. This turns your position into a synthetic option
position.
In this instance you have the opportunity to trade the actual stock
for 100 percent cash or utilize two other options' SSFs, which will cost
you 20 percent of the face value, or a CFD, if you are based outside
of the United States, which will only cost you 10 percent of the face
value.
Purchasing the Alcoa shares outright on May 5th, 2008 would have cost
you $3,664 for 100 shares at $36. 64/share. We pick that point because it
crossed over from being a bearish market into a bullish market. As an SSF
the Alcoa share would only cost you $732.80. The same 100 shares as a CFD
would cost you $366.40. The primary reason you would not purchase the
shares outright and look at the two other market places, SSFs and CFDs,
is to save money up front and to make it easier to create a synthetic put by
shorting stock shares.
By freeing up 80 to 90 percent of your capital on the front end, you
make it easier to purchase the protective put option necessary to turn the
position into a synthetic call. In Figure 16.1, it costs $1.55/share to purchase
an Alcoa Inc. put option at a $35.00 strike price. These options move in
$2.50 increments; this is the best choice for the situation at hand. The final
put option costs totals $155.
The profit from Alcoa's move from $36.64 to $44.60 would have been
$7.96. With 100 shares you would make $796. On an investment of $3,664,

that would be a gross return of 21 percent. If you had traded it as an SSF,
you would have a gross return of 108 percent. If you had traded Alcoa as a
CFD you would have had a return of 217 percent.
The put option is designed to protect you in case the market moves
in the opposite direction. No matter how you look at it, risking the $155
to insure your position is a small price to pay. Had the market moved in
the opposite direction by 21 percent, 108 percent, or 217 percent, the put
option would have been there to pick up the slack and protect you from
potentially devastating losses.
Hard Stop
A hard stop is defined as a stop that you can pinpoint with accuracy, so
that your losses will not exceed a particular price. Soft stops, that is, stop
orders, are not able to guarantee that you will exit at the price you want.
Hard stops, while similar to a synthetic trade, are a way of purchasing a
less expensive option based on your money management rules. If you have
a rule that sets your maximum loss at 2 percent on a position, a properly
placed put option can achieve that goal for you. In addition, you can catch
the move in the market as it drops, without being subjected to any particu
lar shorting stock rules.

In Figure 16.2 we look at Coca-Cola Inc.
Coca-Cola is showing strength from February 22,2008 to February :2";".
2008. Three strong up days convinces us to purchase the stock at $60 per
share. There is resistance at the $60.50 where it collapsed the pre\iou
week. Even so, it appears to have enough momentum to carry it.
The average daily trading range is approximately $1.50/share. Our
money management rules set our stop loss at 2 percent or $58.80 cents.
By purchasing a put option at the closest strike price of $57.50 we only
have to pay $.20 per share. In this case in order to protect ourselws
from the additional $1.30 loss, the difference between our money manage
ment stop loss and the available option strike price, we use a soft stop
order at $58.80 to exit our stock and a hard stop at $57.50 to cover any
losses.
In Figure 16.3 we see Coca-Cola drop in value by over $4.00. Half of
that loss falls below our stop loss order of $58.80. As the market con
tinues to drop, our put option gains in value. We paid $.20 to buy a put
option at $57.50. Once the market price breaks below $57.50 our op
tion contract shifts from an out-of-the-money option to an in-the-money
option. This drives the value of the $57.50 option from $.20/share to
$1. 15/share. This $1.15 offsets most of the $1.20 we lost, $60.00 minus
$58.80.

If you didn't have the put option protecting the position you would not
have anything to offset your losses. Every 100 shares would be $120 out of
your pocket. If you are holding onto an SSF contract, that could represent
as much as 10 percent of your accounts margin value.
Collar
The most common option/stock relationship that traders are aware of is
the covered call. A covered call is considered an income strategy for buy
and hold stock traders. Covered calls are simple to conceptualize. If the
market lacks momentum or volatility, you can sell options against your
shares with a reasonable expectation that the options won't be exercised.
If they are exercised you have the underlying shares to protect you from
losing more than you invested.
A sister strategy to the covered call is the collar. In Chapter 7 we dis
cussed collars in depth. The concept is effectively the same as the covered
call. The difference is that you also purchase a put option to protect your
stock position against any drop in price.
In Figure 16.4 we take a look at Tyco Inc. The market begins a bullish
move on May 13th, 2008. To protect ourselves from a drop in price,

we purchase an at-the-money put at $45 while simultaneously buying
shares at $45. The cost of the option is $.90/share. To cover the cost
of the option we then sell a call at $47.50, a price that Tyco shares
failed to exceed throughout April. The $47.50 call brings in a premium of
$.25/share, which means that your total option expense does not exceed
$.65/share.
What makes this an attractive opportunity is that there are two ways to
profit. The first is that you can make $1.85 in profits from the actual stock
position itself, if the market moves in your direction but doesn't exceed
the value of the sold call-$2.50 minus the cost of the $.65 in net option
premiums. The second way to profit is if the market moves down against
your shares and you gain the increase in value of the put option and the
entire premium from the call.
This is no different than the collars we created for futures or forex con
tracts, yet it is a little-used technique. Depending on where you purchase
your protective put, you could end up with a net-zero expense, depending
on the amount of premium you collect on the call you sell. This is a ver
satile strategy that allows you to extend the buy and hold life of any stock
that you want to keep in your portfolio.

CONCLUSION
The strategies in this book are universal. They are designed to help pro
tect your principal while at the same time maximizing your profit poten
tial. Whether you trade futures, forex, CFDs, or stocks, risk management is
essential to your success. In today's sophisticated environment of swaps,
swaptions, off-balance sheet derivative transactions, and interest strips,
the information provided in this book has been a rudimentary look at what
you can do to protect yourself.
Long gone are the days investors could stick to a particular invest
ment type and expect to achieve the same results that they expected even
a decade ago. With the telecommunication bubble burst, dot-com bubble
burst, and the real estate bubble burst all happening back-to-back, every
day investors need to have a set of tools to help protect themselves. The
strategies presented throughout this book have been designed to do just
that, regardless of the market circumstances.
