because the stock market drifts higher over any decent, long period of
time, not because stock investors are better investors. In addition, there
is no time limit when you invest with stocks. Futures and options expire.
Forex doesn’t expire but the high leverage keeps people from hanging
on to positions for years the way they can with stocks. Investors will
often hang on to losing positions in stocks for years waiting for them
to return to profitability. That is technically possible in forex, but it’s
rarelydone.
The high leverage creates a mentality toward trading that works
againsttraders.Basically,tradingforexattractsa“getrichquick”mental-
ity that works against the trader. Contrast this mentality with the normal
stockinvestingmentalitythatlookstobuyandhold.
The pressures of dealing with high leverage cause the usual forex
trader to make a lot of mistakes. And those mistakes cost more than in
the unleveraged stock world. The high leverage puts a lot of mental pres-
sure on the forex trader that is simply not there in as high a degree for a
stocktrader.
The sum of all these differences is that the forex trader has a much

I’m writing this Preface on a plane to Singapore where I will first give a
speech to about 2,200 people and then relax in several Asian countries in
beachhouses.
How can I do this? Internet access. That’s it. I do all my analysis and
trading online. I can’t live in the real boondocks because I need Internet
accessbutIcanlivearemarkablelifestyleanyway.Myfirststopafterthe

Guesswhat?Idon’tevenreallyneedconstantInternetaccess.Ireally
only need Internet access for about 15 minutes a day. I prefer more than
that because I post a lot of instructional videos on my educational Web
sites and that takes more time and bandwidth. But how about just a few
minutes at an Internet cafe´ in China or London or wherever? That’s all I
need.Thetruegoalforme,andmostpeopletradingforex,isnottomakea

Thisisaverystrongstatement.
HowdoIknowthatthisistrue?HowcanIbesosure?
I have spent many years training traders. I have been teaching these
techniques for over 25 years. More important, I have been training retail
investors with no experience at all trading let alone trading forex. It has
been a very gratifying experience. I have really enjoyed watching people
createanewlifeforthemselves.Everysingleoneofmyretaileducational
clients has made money trading forex, except one. (And he is down just
alittle.)
At one point, I foolishly offered a mentoring program called Extreme

OVERVIEW OF THE CONTENTS
I’vedesignedthisbooktobeusefulforanyonewhoisinterestedinmaking
moneytradingforex,fromnovicetopro.
This book explains all the basics that a novice needs to know to get
going. At the same time, experienced traders will find the systems and
methods,particularlymyenhancementsofclassicmethods,tobeofsignif-
icantvalue.Everytraderwillfindthesectionsonthepsychologyoftrading

ButIassumethatyouknownothingabouttradingforex.I’vealsoincluded
a number of real stories of my trading, to give some flavor of the life of a
professionalinstitutionaltrader.Evenifyouhavesomeexperiencetrading

theforexmarket.Thischapterintroducestrendanalysis.Thistechniqueis

In addition, I introduce to the public for the first time the Bishop tech-
nique.Thisuniqueindicatorhasatremendoustrackrecordofgettingout

I’m also introducing in this book a new way to filter trades. This fil-
tereliminatesabouthalfofmylosingtradeswhileonlyeliminatingabout
5 percent of my winning trades. What a great tradeoff! It dramatically
enhancestheprofitofthetrendanalysisandothertechniques.
Chapter 3 is all about channel breakouts. This classic technique has
been around since the 1960s. It’s been around that long because it is
that profitable. I’d estimate that most of the largest and most profitable

tomissthisidea.Ithenaddinanotherexitstrategycalledthelastbar.Igot
this idea from ace trader Peter Brandt. It sharply reduces the risk in any
given trade to a trivial amount. As you can imagine, cutting risk to small
amountsdramaticallyenhancesyourprofitsattheendoftheyear.
I introduce the Conqueror in Chapter 4. This is a truly unique trad-
ingsystemthatwasoriginallydesignedbylegendarytrader/analystBruce
Babcock,enhancedbyacesystemresearcherNelsonFreeburg,andfinally
tweakedbyme.Thissystemmonitorsthemarketfromthreedifferenttime

Iknowthatusesdifferentexitandentrytechniques.
The Conqueror is a technique that has a very hard time entering the
market. It wants all the conditions to be perfect before entering a trade
butjumpsoutofthepositionattheslightestintimationofweaknessinthe
trade.IlovethissystemandIthinkyouwill,too!
Chapter 5 introduces how to use stochastics profitably. It seems like
everybodyusesstochastics;theyareperhapsthemostpopularindicatorin

how to profitably use stochastics while sidestepping the usual traps that
drainmoneyfromyouraccount.IshowyouhowIusestochasticstoiden-
tify short-term turning points and, more important, how to identify major
turningpoints.Asabonus,Ihaveincludedanamazinginterviewwiththe
inventor of stochastics, George Lane. I had the privilege of interviewing
him before he passed away. This hard-hitting interview reveals how he
inventedstochastics,wheretheygottheirname,and,mostimportant,how
Georgehimselfusedstochasticstomakemoneyinhistrading.Heliterally
states that, used correctly, “it is damned near infallible”! This interview
ispriceless.
Another unique feature of this book is that I show you different
profitable techniques to use over different time horizons. The techniques
discussedherearetechniquesthatlookatthemarketfromtheperspective
ofdaystoweeks.Chapter6introducesseveraltechniquesthattradeover
a much shorter term. These techniques hold positions for less than one
day.Thesepattern-recognitiontechniquesaregreatforthosetraderswho
want to make money during the day rather than over the next week or
month. I like to think about these trades as just churning out some nice
profitsdayafterday.Nomonsterprofitsbecauseyoucan’tmakemonster
profits in just a day. But making a nice chunk of money during the day is
averynicething.
This chapter also introduces the multiunit tactic. This technique uses
multiple contract positions to give you more flexibility in your exits.

youraccount.Ninetypercentofforextraderslosemoneywhileonlyabout
5percentmakemoney.Iarguethatoneofthecriticaldifferencesbetween
thewinnersandthelosersisthatthewinnersknowhowtocontroltherisk
intheiraccount.
Chapter 7 drills down on this important subject and gives you clear
instructionsonhowtocontroltheriskinyouraccounttoensurethatyou
will be a profitable trader. I even take risk management one step further
and show you how to use it as an offensive weapon, not just a defensive
one. The concept of using risk management as a method for enhancing
profitsisrarelytalkedaboutinthemarkets.Thischapteriscriticalbecause
youneedtobeabletosurvivetheinevitablelosingstreakswithoutlosing
any significant money and to also be able to maintain the proper mental
state.Youmustnevergettoasituationthatisbothfinanciallyandmentally
debilitating.
The next chapter, Chapter 8, shows a new technique called the Sling-
shot as well as the mini-Slingshot. I also use this chapter to extend the
discussionofriskmanagement.TheSlingshotisaveryinterestingchapter
due to the unique concepts embedded in it. It builds on the risk manage-
mentconceptsfromthepreviouschapter.
Ibelieve thatriskmanagement isactuallythesecond-most important
factorforinvestmentsuccess.Chapter9looksatthebiggestblockagainst
making money in the markets: you. It is your psychology. You are the
biggest problem. Intellectual skills are trivial. You will rarely have prob-
lemswiththemethodsthatIpresentinthisbook.Thebasicriskmanage-
mentrulesarealsoeasytoapply.Butthepsychologyoftradingisintense
and few can master it. I want you to be a huge success; it is the real key
tomakingmoneyinthemarket.Pleasedonotdisregarditorpushittothe

not make any money with them if you don’t have the proper psychology.

2 HOWTOMAKEALIVINGTRADINGFOREIGNEXCHANGE
SELL A YARD OF CABLE
I was the treasurer of the New York branch of a Swiss bank in the late
1980s. We had a client who was a cotton merchant from Turkey. He
speculated in forex as a paying hobby. Late one afternoon in New York,
he called one of our dealers and placed an order tosell a “yard of cable.”
Let me translate that into English. What he wanted to do was to sell
1 billion British Pounds. (The only currency that is capitalized is the
Pound;allothersarelowercase.Forextrivia!)Wewereshockedatthesize
oftheorder.Thatwouldbeahugeorderforanymajorfinancialinstitution,
let alone for a single individual. We were the counterparty on all orders
from our customers so we were expected to take the other side of his
trade.Noway.Weweren’tbigenoughtotakeonsuchalargeposition.
All foreign exchange trading, except for a small amount on the Inter-
national Monetary Market, is over the counter. There is no exchange. All
transactionsaredoneoverthephone,withabroker,orviasomeelectronic
meansbetweentwoentities.Entitiesareusuallyfinancial institutionsbut
areoftencorporationsandsometimesindividuals.Thatmeansthatwhena
retailinvestor,suchasmyself,putsinanorderthroughanonlinebroker,
thecounterpartyispracticallyunknown.Itcouldverywellbethebroker.
However, the broker could be aggregating prices from different brokers
or institutions. The source of the prices are unknown, which is very dif-
ferent from the stock market because a stock is generally traded only at
oneplace,suchastheNewYorkStockExchange(NYSE).Technically,the
NASDAQisanover-the-countermarketthatiscentralizedinoneplaceso
itis,effectively,anexchange.Forexiscompletelydiversified.
Back to the yard of cable. The size of his order meant that we had to
lay off the risk to other dealers. But there was no way that we could find
adealertotakethewholebillionPounds.Even100millionPoundswasa

ItwasverylateintheafternoonandIonlyhadafewforexdealerson

the top of the T. I could see and hear everything on the desk this way. I

simultaneously said, “Yours, 100.” Saying “yours” meant that the Pounds
were sold to the buyer and were theirs. We would have said “mine” if we
were buyers. The “100” was the quantity that we sold them, in this case,
100millionPounds.

The pressure from our order caused a vacuum to open up under the
price. We may have sold a billion cable at 43 but the price was 100 pips
lower in a fraction of the second. A pip is the smallest normal increment
that a currency trades in even though some brokers quote in tenths of a
pip.Ageneralruleofthumbistostartwiththefar-leftdigitinapriceand

TRANSACTION COSTS
The biggest transaction cost in trading forex is the bid/ask spread. The
bid/ask spread is the difference between the bid price and the ask, or of-
fer, price. For example, suppose that the market is 63 bid and 66 offered
orasked.Youwillhavetobuyat66ifyouwanttobuyorsellat63ifyou

Hopefullythemarketwillmoveinyourdirectionrightawayandeliminate

The point is that the bid/ask is an implicit cost in every transaction. The
bid/askspreadcanbeanywherefromonepiptotensofpips.
The more liquid the instrument, the narrower or tighter the bid/ask
spread.So,generally,itismuchcheapertotradeEUR/USDthanGBP/AUD.
The bid/ask could be ten pips on the GBP/AUD at the same time the
EUR/USD may only be two pips. Everybody pays the bid/ask spread un-

Transaction costs become more important the shorter the time hori-
zon of the trader. A person who is going to hold a position for months
could care less about the cost of the bid/ask spread. A three-pip spread
over months is irrelevant. But three pips is highly important for a trader
who is doing many trades throughout the day. Their profit objective may
only be 20 pips; three pips is a significant hit on profitability. Remember,

The quantity changes with each order. As mentioned earlier, the market
always has a bid price and an ask, or offer, price. A market order to buy

immediately.

the market when it rallies. Let’s assume that the market is 38 bid and 39

Thatmightbeanextremeviewbutthereissometruthtohisconcept.
So I decided to strip my trading down to the bare essentials. I wanted to
really get to the heart of trading. No BS, just rock-bottom truth. In fact, I
wantedtostripthingsdownsolowthatwhatIwouldcomeupwithwould
soundlikechild’splay.
The basic truth of trading is that we must be long when the market
is bullish, be short when it is bearish, and stand aside when it is neutral.
Simple,yes?

WHAT IS A TREND?
Turns out that there is a classic definition of a bull or bear market. A
bull market is any market that is making higher highs and higher lows.

However,itissimpleonlyifweagreeonwhatahighorlowis.Andthat

meanings.Theycanrefertothehighorlowofagivenday’sbar(orcandle)

IthinkwecanagreethatthehighinthemiddleofAprilismoreimpor-
tantthanthehighsinthemiddleofOctober.Wecanseethatveryclearly

DeMark’s rating system is simple. Choose a swing high or swing low
in Figure 2.1. For example, let’s look at the first circled high on the chart

Let’s do this with the highest bar in August. We know that it is a swing
high because it has at least one bar on either side of it with a lower high.

Let’s now look at the next circled bar to the right of the one we just

41-barhigh.Onceagain,let’scountbars.Weknowthatthereisonetothe

I’dcallthata10-barlow.
You can go through all the highs and lows on the whole chart rating
thembyhowmanybarstheyhavetotheleft.Itisclearthatweintuitively
rank bars with higher numbers as being more significant than bars with
fewer numbers. This then leads to the concept that we can now use ob-
jectivity when describing chart patterns. For example, we can now agree
that we willonlydraw up trendlines that connect five bar or higher lows.
Lookingatthechart,identifyallthefive-barlowsanddrawatrendlinecon-
necting the two most recent five-bar lows. We will never disagree about
wheretodrawthetrendlinebecausewehaveagreedthatfive-barlowsare

Which leads to the next step in our journey. What bar level is signifi-
cant? What bar level should we be focusing on to eliminate little random
blipmovementsandkeepusfocusedonwhatisreallyimportant?

From now on, I’m going to focus only on significant swing highs and
lows,previouslydefinedasthree-barhighsorlows.We’regoingtoignore
allswinghighsandlowsthataretwo-barhighsorlows.
Let’s take a look at Figure 2.2. This chart shows the same currency
pair over basically the same time frame but I have changed the circles
from what I intuitively identified as significant swing highs and lows to
what I have now objectively defined as three-bar high and lows. Note
that there are not too many changes. The chart is roughly the same.
However, now the significant highs and lows are objectively defined.
Usingouragreed-upondefinitions,oursignificanthighsandlowswouldbe
thesame.
HOW TO PROFITABLY TRADE BULL
AND BEAR MARKETS
Now that we agree on what the trend is in the market, we can go to the
nextstep.Rememberthatabullmarketisdefinedasamarketthatismak-
ing higher highs and higher lows. A bear market is a market that is mak-
ing lower highs and lower lows. A neutral market is defined as any other
condition.
The highs and lows can come in any order. So, we could make two
highs followed by two lows. Generally, however, we oscillate between
highs and lows such that we make a high, a low, a high, and then a final
low. But remember, it doesn’t matter in what order the highs and lows
occur.
At the top of the chart in Figure 2.3, look at the high in August. I’ve
labeledthefirstfourhighsandlows.Notethatinthiscase,thesecondhigh
is lower than the first high; we can say that we are making lower highs.
Also note that the second swing low is lower than the first low. Thus, we
can say that we are making lower lows. This is the definition of a bear
market.
My concept is very simple but powerful. We must always be long in
bullmarkets,beshortinbearmarkets,andstandasideinallothermarkets.

It is a higher low. So, at that point in time, the market is making lower
highs but higher lows. So, it’s a neutral market, right? The market then
breaks lower and the next circle is a new lower low and the bear market
isbackinplace.

Onceyouunderstandsignificantswinghighsorlows,tradingthemarkets

whenthemarketturnsintoabearmarket,andstandasidewhenthemarket
isinanyothercondition.Let’stakealookatsomeexamples.
In Figure 2.4, start at the top swing high in August. That is our first
swinghigh.Itisthenfollowedbyaswinglowandthenaswinghigh.Note
that I have drawn a horizontal line at the low of the first swing low. Our
rule is to go short when the market breaks that horizontal line at the low
ofthefirstswinglow.I’veputanarrowpointingdownonthedaythatwe

thatwewon’tputinanewlowerswinglowafterwebreakthatfirstlow.In
thiscase,thelowerlowthatconfirmsthatweareinabearmarketactually

In other words, I can put in a sell short order under the first swing
low as soon as I have a confirmed lower high. At the second high, I have
conformed half of the definition of a bear market: lower highs. Now all I
need to get short is to wait for a break of the first swing low to confirm
thatwewillbemakingalowerlow,againconfirmingabearmarket.Once
again, I don’t need to wait until the lower low occurs to get short. I just

AVERAGE DIRECTIONAL INDEX
I think that I have the greatest mentoring clients. I provide a mentoring
service through the Investment Mentoring Institute. One of the great joys
is that I get to learn a lot. My students are diligent about making money
so they intensely investigate the markets. One of them came up with an
improvementonwhatIwasteachingandIwanttoshareitwithyou.
First, let me tell you about average directional index (ADX). Here is
howStockCharts.com(recommendedforstocktraders!)describesADX:
J. Welles Wilder developed the Average Directional Index (ADX) to
evaluatethestrengthofacurrenttrend,beitupordown.It’simpor-
tant to determine whether the market is trending or trading (mov-
ing sideways), because certain indicators give more useful results
dependingonthemarketdoingoneortheother.
TheADXisanoscillatorthatfluctuatesbetween0and100.Even
though the scale is from 0 to 100, readings above 60 are relatively
rare. Low readings, below 20, indicate a weak trend and high read-
ings,above40,indicateastrongtrend.Theindicatordoesnotgrade
thetrendasbullishorbearish,butmerelyassessesthestrengthofthe
current trend. A reading above 40 can indicate a strong downtrend
aswellasastronguptrend.
ADX can also be used to identify potential changes in a market
fromtrendingtonon-trending.WhenADXbeginstostrengthenfrom
below 20 and moves above 20, it is a sign that the trading range is
endingandatrendisdeveloping.1
J.Welles Wilderconstructed ADX asanindicator that measured how
strong a trend was no matter if it was up or down. The idea was not to
identifythetrendbutthestrengthofwhatevertrendwasinplace.Iwon’t
gointohowtheindexisconstructedbecausethereisplentyofinformation

Turns out that this simple system has been consistently profitable
sincehefirstwroteaboutitinthe1960s.However,therehavebeenmany
enhancementsbyotherstothebasicrulesoutlinedbyDonchian.
There has been a lot of research into channel breakouts in the inter-
veningyears.Channelbreakoutsbecameperhapsthemostdominantform
of trend following in the 1980s. Famous traders, such as Richard Dennis,
becameincrediblyrichandfamoususingchannelbreakouts.Now,billions
ofdollarsarebeingtradedusingchannelbreakouts.
Ithinkthatthebasicpremisebehindchannelbreakoutswasthatprices
would drift sideways unless a new fundamental environment came into
play. New fundamental data would cause the market to need to discount
that new information and cause the price to move in one direction or an-
other.Thismovementcausedbyachangeinthefundamentalswouldtrig-
gerabuyorsellsignalonthechannelbreakout.Thechannelbreakoutwas
notpredictingachangeinpricesbutwasadeptatidentifyingthem.
Anotherwaytolookatitwastoconsiderwhatmustbehappeningin
amarkettocausethepricetomakeanewone-monthhigh.Something,we
don’t know what, must be happening that is significant in order to cause
the price to move to a new one-month high. Note that generally bigger
fundamental factors are necessary to break longer channels. It is likely
thatsomethingfarmoresignificantishappeningwhenapairmakesanew
three-monthhighthanifitmakesathree-dayhigh.
This is a critical concept. Generally, we can gauge the power of the
movebythelengthofthebreakout.Ittakesabiggerfundamentalchange
in a market to make a new 52-week high than a new five-day high. I pay
muchmoreattentiontonew52-weekhighsthanfive-dayhighs.Takenote
ofthisconcept!
I’m going to show you how to trade channel breakouts, including my
ownenhancements.
WHAT IS A CHANNEL BREAKOUT?
A channel breakout is simply a breakout of the high or low of a certain
numberofdaysinthepast.Forexample,tofindtheentryandexitpoints

and identify the highest price and the lowest price during that period of

In the late 1980s I started using what I called the 40/20. When there
wasabreakofthe40-dayhighorlow,weenteredlongandshortpositions.
The40/20wasthesamesystemasthe4WR,exceptthatthetimewastwice
as long. You could say that entries were made using an eight-week rule.
However,theexitswereonabreakofthe20-dayhighorlowdependingon
whetheryouwerelongorshort.Thismeant,forexample,thatyouwould
enter long when the market made a new 40-day high and you would exit
thattradewhenitmadeanew20-daylow.Notethatyoudidnotgoshort
when the market made a new 20-day low; you only exited your existing
long position. You would be flat the market if you got stopped out. This
is different from the classic channel breakout. With the classic channel
breakout,youarealwaysinthemarketwhilethenewmethodhasyouon
thesidelines.
This was a major breakthrough in channel trading. Often a market
would be in a nice strong rally and then quickly dip to the bottom and
getshortonwhatwasreallyjustaretracementinamajorbullmarket.The
rally on the British Pound chart (Figure 3.1) in September is an excellent
example.Inhindsight,wewouldn’twanttogetlongonthatbreaktonew

I used the 40/20 for many years. Studies and my own experience

Ilaterchangedtoa55/20afterthereleaseoftheTurtleSystemtothe
public. The Turtles were a group of traders trained by legendary traders
RichardDennisandWilliamEckhardt.Theywerebasicallytrendfollowers
and their core techniques were channel breakouts. They had settled on
55/20parameters.TheTurtlesweresomeofthemostprofitabletraders,so
I was intrigued to find out that they were users of channel breakouts. In
additiontousing55/20,theywerealsousingtheclassic4WR!
I love to learn, particularly from great traders. Dennis and Eckhardt
certainly fit that description, having made hundreds of millions of dollars
by the mid-1980s. It was amazing that they achieved that much success
usingtheold-fashioned4WR.
But they had also found out that using alonger-term entry parameter

I had not checked which parameters were best so I tested whether
the 55-day parameter was better than my 40-day parameter. It was! Ac-
tually, just about everything between 50 to 60 days had about the same
results. So I enhanced my trading by switching to the parameters that
the Turtles were using. Basically, I was shifting from a two-month break-
out to almost a three-month breakout. I was going to be trading less

place.
To repeat: Entries are made using 55 days but exits are made with
20days.Let’slookatanexample.Figure3.2isthesamechartasshownin

two lines below the prices. The higher line is the 20-day low line and the
bottomlineisthe55.
Let’s follow the same process we did earlier but this time add in the
55-dayparameter.
First, note that we do not get short in early April but wait until early
May.Thisshowsacoupleofthings.First,55-daybreakoutswilloccurfar
less often than 20-day breakouts. In this case, the market had to drop
for another month to create a strong enough bear market to trigger the
55-daylow.Second,thisactuallyhurtusinthistradebecausewesoldata
pricelowerthanwewouldhaveusingthe20-daylow.Ontheotherhand,
I actually don’t mind the lower price for the entry because it means that
I didn’t have my money tied up for about a month with a market going
nowhere. I don’t want to invest in things that are going sideways. It’s a
wasteoftimeandattention.
We get short then in early May and get stopped out when the mar-
ket moves above the 20-day high near the end of June for a loss of about
450 pips. Ugh. Now we are on the sidelines, not long. The market then
moves sideways and then breaks the 55-day high and gets us long in the
middle of July. That trade quickly fails and we are stopped out right at
the beginning of August for about a 650-pip loss. A few days later, we get
short when we break the 55-day low on August 8. The market then col-
lapsesandweshowaprofituntilthesharprallystopsusoutneartheend
of September. We still make about a 750-pip profit. We get short again in
earlyOctoberandwouldbeshowinganiceprofitasthechartends.
Note that this shift to 55 days eliminated the short position in early
June.Welostalittlemoreonthelosingtradesthanwhenweusedthe4WR,

A lot of people ask me what will happen if these two parameters

There is no question that a method can become too popular and the
performance begins to degrade. But this technique is robust. First, few

THE PROS AND CONS OF
CHANNEL BREAKOUTS
The biggest argument in favor of channel breakouts is that they are ex-
tremelyprofitable.Theyarethecoretechniqueusedbythemostprofitable

I recognize that my job is to make money, not to be brilliant or creative
or even right. It’s to make money. So I want to use techniques that make
moneyandthechannelbreakouttechniquemakesmoney.

possible false breakout. But don’t fear, I will discuss the ways to protect
againstseriouslossesusingchannelbreakouts.
Themaindisadvantagewiththechannelbreakouttechniqueisthatthe
stop loss is a long way from the entry point. I haven’t talked about risk
management yet (see Chapter 7), but let me just say that the wider the

words, you can’t take a normal-size position because the risk is so high
duetothedistanceoftheentrypricetotheexitchannel.Gettingstopped
outisapainfulexperiencebecauseofthedistancebetweentheentryand
exit channels. So what we need to do is to enhance the rules of channel
breakoutstoimproveperformanceandreducerisk.
THE BISHOP
My first enhancement is to use the Bishop to trigger liquidation signals.
Take a look at Figure 3.3. I have taken Figure 3.2 and added the average
directionalindex(ADX)indicatoratthebottom.Asyoucansee,theBishop
gaveustwogoodsignals.I’veputthecursoronthefirstsignaltomakeit

In any case, the net result of adding the Bishop exit signal is a major
improvement to profitability for the year. I think this is a good example
becauseithasonebigwinnerandonesmallloser,whichistypicalofthe
Bishop. It will make some amazing calls that add to our bottom line but
then will have a signal that hurts us slightly. The net result is still a big
winner.
ADX FILTER
My next enhancement to the basic channel breakout is to add the ADX
filterthatIintroducedinthepreviouschapter.Let’stakeanewlookatthe
GBP/USDchartinFigure3.5.ThisfigureshowstheADXacrossthebottom

theADXwasrising.Asaresult,theADXfilternevereliminatedanytrades.
InFigure3.6,thecharthasbeenmovedtotherightsothatyoucansee
themorerecentpriceaction.I’veputthecursoronDecember4wherethe
marketbreaksdown.AlsonotethebreakdownjustattheendofDecember.
The ADX was declining in both cases so we would not have taken either
of these trades. As the chart shows, there was no real follow-through on
eitherofthesetrades.TheADXfiltersaved usfromthesharprallytothe
20-dayhighwherewewouldhavebeenstoppedoutforalossofover800
pips.TheADXfilterhelpedusdodgeabullet.
The ADX filter would have gotten us out of the trade at the end of
December as well. This would have saved us a little money because we
would have stopped ourselves out due to a new technique I’m going to
show you next. But I still wouldn’t have minded not entering that trade
anyway. The market moved sharply higher and I would have been suffer-
ing mightily for a couple of weeks until the market finally broke down in
the middle of January. I would have preferred not to enter this trade and
insteadgetinalittlelowerinthemiddleofJanuary.
Using an ADX filter means that we will be trading slightly less often
because, by definition, some of the trades will be not entered because at
leastsomeofthetimetheADXwillbemovinglower.Ourprofits,however,
aregreatlyenhancedbecausewewillusuallyeliminatetakingonsomelos-
ingtrades.Rarelywillwebeeliminatingaprofitabletrade.It’snobigdeal
if we eliminate a winning trade because we will get in at a slightly lower
price. Remember, if the market breaks through the 55-day high/low and
the ADX is declining, we will look to get in on the next breakout, which
only requires one countertrend move. For example, we break to a new

THE PRINCIPLE OF
INSTANT GRATIFICATION
I believe that one of the key underlying principles of profitable trading is
the principle of instant gratification. This means that we should show a
profitfromtheverybeginningofthetrade.Thinkbacktoyourmostprof-
itabletrades.Weren’ttheyprofitablefromtheverybeginningofthetrade
or just after that? I think that my losing trades were nearly always losers
fromthefirstdayon,too.Basically,youcanalmostpredictwhetherornot
a trade will be profitable by the price action of the first couple of days.
We must always find ways to make sure that we are profitable from the
beginningofthetrade.
This principle is one of the reasons that I prefer to be a buyer on
strength and seller on weakness. This sharply increases the chances that
mytradewillbeprofitablefromthestart.
TheflipsideofthisprincipleisthatIdon’tliketoholdpositionsthat
are losing money. I want to get out before they become bigger losers. I
don’twanttowaitaroundtoseeiftheyturnintowinners.Iwanttogetout
rightaway.
REJECTION RULE
This leads me to the next enhancement to the classic channel breakout
method: the rejection rule. This rule is designed to ensure that we are in
syncwiththeprincipleofinstantgratification.
Markets break out of support and resistance all the time. Sometimes
the market will follow through and we will have a winning trade. Other
times the market will fail and fall back below the breakout level. The
question is whether the breakout was a false breakout or a premature
breakout.Afalsebreakoutisabreakoutthatsimplyfailsandnevershows
anyfollow-through.Apremature breakoutisabreakoutthatinitiallyfails

they could overwhelm the bears. Breakouts cannot be predicted but we
wanttoprotectourselvesagainstanysortofbreakoutthathasnofollow-
through.
Icallthisruletherejectionrulebecausemarketswillrejectapriceif
the price is too high or low for current conditions. The price may break
out above a 55-day high but then move back to below the breakout level.
In this case, the market has rejected the new high. The bears are able to
quickly mount a counterattack and reject the breakout. The bulls do not
haveenoughstrengthtokeepthemarketabovethebreakoutlevel.
TakealookatFigure3.7,whichfocusesonjustoneshortperiodofthe
previousfigures.Anarrowindicatesthebreakoutthatwewanttoview.
The first part of the rejection rule is the five-day condition. I want to
see that the 55-day high has been flat or declining for at least five days
priortothebreakout(usetheoppositeforbreakdowns).Thefive-daycon-
dition ensures that we don’t apply the rejection rule to markets that are
runningstronglyupordown.Weonlywanttousetherejectionrulewhen
themarketisroughlysideways.Wewanttofindallthereasonsintheworld
to hang onto a position when the market is running. We want to look for
reasons to bail out if the market is going sideways. So we only apply the
rejectionrulewhenthefive-dayconditionisinplace.
Figure 3.7 shows that the five-day condition is in place. The 55-day
channelhasbeenflatforoverfivedayswhenthebreakoutcomesonJuly
15(seearrow).Therejectionruleisnowinplace.
Therejectionruleissimple:Ifafive-dayconditionisinplace,liquidate
a55-daybuysignalifthepriceofthemarketclosesbelowtheinitialbreak-
out level on the day of the breakout or the next day. In other words, the
pricemustcloseabovethebreakoutlevelforthefirsttwodaysofthetrade
or you will exit on the close. If you can’t exit on the close for whatever
reason—forexample,ifyouhaveajobthatdoesn’tallowyoutowatchthe
marketsduringtheday—thenexitassoonaspossible.
Let’stakeanotherlookatFigure3.7.Themarkethasbrokenabovethe

ketopenedbelowthe55-dayhighbutbrokethroughduringtheday.First,
wewanttochecktoseeifthemarketclosesabovethebreakoutlevelofthe
55-day high on this first day. In this case, the market closes above the
55-day high so there is no rejection. However, the price closes below
the breakout level on the second day of the trade so we exit the trade
immediately.
(cid:1)
We are still looking at the original 55-day breakout level that caused
us to initiate the trade, not the new 55-day high created by the
breakoutday.

Adding the rejection rule adds significantly to the classic channel
breakout. But there are two drawbacks. The first is that we don’t really

yesterday’s close. The true low is the lower of today’s low or yester-

The true range is simply the true high minus the true low. The
true range is designed to better measure the totality of price move-

Golongifallthreeconditionsarepositive.Goshortifallthreecondi-
tionsarenegative.Standasideonanyothercondition.I’llgettotheprotec-
tivestopinaminute.
Let’s consider this entry situation. Basically, we are looking at three
different time horizons. First, we are looking at the price action over the
last10dayswhenwelookatconditionone.Conditiontwoisreallylooking
atthepriceactionofthelast20days.Finally,conditionthreeislookingat
thelast40days.
Wedonotgolongorshortuntilallthreetrendsinthemarketarecon-
gruent. The concept of applying three different time frames is unusual in
trading. I had kind of a “doh” moment when I first saw it because it is so
obviousyetneverreallydone.
Basically, we are making sure that whatever trend is in place is pow-
erful enough to turn all three directions bullish or bearish. A sideways
market will not trigger the three conditions and we will stand aside in
those situations, which is perfect. Only when the market really starts to
move in one direction or another will the three trends line up and we
will enter the market. Otherwise, one or more of the three conditions
will be positive or negative and we will look for opportunities in other
markets.
Itis,therefore,difficulttogetabuyorsellsignalfromtheConqueror.
Mostofthetimeitsitsoutofthemarket.Itstubbornlywaitsforthemarket
to really get going in one direction or another before it jumps in with a
long or short position. This is one of the most important features of the
Conqueror. It sits out when the market is drifting sideways or has only
a slight trend. This saves a lot of money in whipsaw losses. It is also a
significantimprovementovermosttradingmethods!

The Conqueror sits back and waits until the trend is conclusively in
one direction before entering. At this point, there are two negatives and
one positive foronly anet negative of one. Thisisnot conclusive enough
fortheConqueror.

Wegoshortonthecloseoftradingonthedaythatthethirdcondition

we are now short. All three conditions have been triggered. Where is our
protectivestop?Nowitgetsreallyinteresting.Wearegoingtouseseveral
differentmethodstodeterminetheprotectivestop.
Thefirststopisasimplemoneymanagementstop.Forastandardcon-
tract, place a stop that would be a $2,000 loss. In other words, figure out
how many pips represents $2,000 and place a stop that many pips away
from the entry price. Fortunately, this stop will rarely be triggered. The
other forms of stop will be triggered far more often. Still, we want some
disasterinsuranceinplace.
I’veaddedanotherpaneltothechart(seeFigure4.2).Thenewlower
panel shows the average true range (ATR) over the past 40 days. This is
simplythe40-dayaverageoftheATR.YoucanseethattheATRwasabout
0.024onthedaywewentshort.Thatisreally240pips.Youcanalsoseethat
the market was becoming more volatile from August through November.
The ATR was slowly moving higher during this period showing that the
average range forthe day was increasing. Infact, itincreased fromabout
150pipsperdayto350pipsperday.
This is the point where we create the two different versions of the
Conqueror. Conqueror I will create a stop two times the ATR away from
the current close while Conqueror II will create a stop 12 times the ATR
away from the current close. Let’s look closer at the current situation as
anexample.
Let’ssaythatwegetshortat1.7400.TheATRonthatdayis0.0240,or
240 pips. Conqueror I will place a protective stop loss 480 pips above the
lowestcloseinthemove.Ondayone,thelowestclosewillbethecloseof

changethestop.
In addition, you would also change the stop as the ATR changes. We
startedwithanATRof240pipsbutiteventuallygetsuptoabout350pips
in November. That means that we would start by adding 480 pips to the
lowestclosebutcouldbeabout700pipswideinNovember!

I like this because it widens out the stop when the market is more
volatile.Thatisperfect.
The day after the entry bar, which is marked with the third arrow,
closes slightly up. We would keep the ATR stop at the same level. How-
ever, the next day shows a drop and a lower close. We would lower the
stopto480abovethenewlowerclose.Andsoon.
Conqueror IIusesthesameideaexcept thestopis12timestheATR,
or about 2,880 pips above the lowest close. That is a significant distance
from the market so few traders will be able to trade it. I mention it here
becauseitisaprofitablemethodbutchallengingforanyonebutthemost
highly capitalized to trade. I won’t mention it again in this chapter. From
nowon,I’llonlyspeakoftheConquerorasbeingConquerorI.
ADJUSTING THE STOP
So far we have discussed two different stop loss techniques: the initial
$2,000moneymanagementstopandthetwotimesATRstop.Nowcomes
thereallyinterestingpart.
We are going to adjust the ATR stop by how many conditions are in
play.Rememberthatwewentshortwhenallthreeconditionswerenega-
tive.Everytimeafactorchangessign(positiveornegative),wewillreduce
thesizeoftheATRstopbyathird.Let’sworkthroughanexample.
We originally put on the trade in Figure 4.2 with a 480-pip stop. (I’m
goingtoignoresubsequentchangesintheATRinourcalculationsbutyou
shouldn’t in the real world.) Note that all three conditions remain nega-
tive until the downward-pointing arrow in Figure 4.3. At that point, the
price closes just barely above the 10-day MA, which turns that condition
positive.
Wetakeour480-pipstopanddeductone-thirdof480.One-thirdof480
is158pips.Wesubtract158from480,givingusanewtrailingstopof322.
The lowest close occurs a couple of days before that at 1.7029. We place
our new protective stop loss 322 pips above that at 1.7351. The price on
thatdaydoesnotstopusoutbutthereisaspikehighertwodaysafterthe

We would not have been stopped out if we had continued with the

WHAT ARE STOCHASTICS?
Stochastics are a form of oscillator. An oscillator measures the rate of
change of prices. The simplest oscillator takes the current price and sub-

market ahead of the actual turn in price because changes in momentum
leadchangesintheactualprice.Thisideafollowstheanalogyofphysics.
Therateofchangeofanobjectwillshowdecreasingmomentumuntilthe

The big criticism of oscillators is that they sometimes give a trading
signal but the market is in such a strong trending mode that the signal is
false.Thecommonwisdomisthatoscillatorsdowellinnontrendingmar-

The simpler the oscillator, the more sensitive it is to current market
price action. For example, a simple oscillator based on the 10-day rate of

Fortunately,youwon’tneedtoknowthemathunlessyouwanttofid-

just outlined. The software packages and quote systems often allow you
tochangetheparameters.
Theoneimportantquestionthatmustbeaddressedisthetermofthe

answer is 14 days, which many people claim is about half of the normal
cycleofforexprices.Otherpeopleuseninedays,thoughIhaveneverheard

HOW TO USE STOCHASTICS

Stochastics can be used as an overbought and oversold indicator. This is
the most common use. The underlying idea is that a market will not nor-

Conversely, a sharp drop in price, without a retracement, will lead to an
oversoldmarket.
The basic theory is that prices cannot go too far too fast. If they do,
then they are ripe for a retracement. The retracement is necessary to
“correcttheoverbought situation.” Amarket that hasshot upquickly has
movedthepriceofthepairawayfromtheunderlyingvaluetooquickly.As
a result, the market will set back slightly to induce more buying into the
market.

suadetradersfrombuyingthemarketafterthemarkethasmovedstrongly.

In general, the concept of overbought and oversold works. Typically,
whenthestochasticsgetabove80percent,themarketisoverbought;when
stochasticsgetbelow20percent,themarketisoversold.Youshouldnor-
mally expect a correction to ensue relatively soon. This is the way that
mostpeopleusestochastics.However,justbecauseitgenerallyworksand
callscorrectionsaccuratelydoesn’tmeanthatitisprofitable.Infact,sell-
ingwhenstochasticsgetabove80percentandbuyingwhenstochasticsget

Some people modify the method and sell when the stochastics get
above 80 percent and the %K crosses down below the %D and buy when
the stochastics get below 20 percent and the %K crosses above the %D.
Thisworksbetterbutisstillamoney-losingstrategy.

cepts of overbought and oversold work during mild trends and sideways

suggested that you are better off buying when the %K crosses above the
80 percent line and selling when the %K crosses down below the 20 per-
centline.Thisisactuallybetterthanwhatwehavebeentalkingabout,but
italsolosesmoney.
First, you must determine what kind of trader you are before using
stochastics as an overbought or oversold indicator. You should consider
using stochastics if you are the type of trader who wants to buy dips and
sell rallies in trendless markets, and is willing to lose when the market
finally starts to trend. If you are a trend follower, then you should ignore
the stochastic overbought and oversold reading. Stochastics will register
an overbought reading for weeks during a major explosive bull market.
The more explosive, the more the indicator will falsely be considered
overbought.

TRADING SIGNALS FROM CROSSOVERS
Perhapsthemostcommonuseofstochasticsistogivetradingsignalsde-
rived from the crossover of the slower moving line, the %D, by the faster
moving line, the %K. The idea is that you sell the market when the %K
crossesbelowthe%Dandbuywhenthe%Kcrossedabovethe%D.
It is usually considered that the best signals come when the stochas-
tic crossover occurs when the stochastics are above 80 percent or below
20 percent. These two levels give the most room for the signals to make
moneysincethesignaloccurredwhenthemarketwasoverboughtorover-

Obviously, many investors will not want to trade in a market using
a monthly signal but even these people will want to consider using this
as a powerful trend indicator to filter short-term trades. In other words,
takeshort-termtradesonlyinthedirectionofthelong-termtrendasiden-

method can be used to time longer-term trades such as forex hedges for

THE BEST WAY TO MAKE MONEY
USING STOCHASTICS
Now we get to the fun stuff. This is the real way to make money using
stochastics.Letmefirstdescribewhatdivergencesare.
Oneofthemostpopularmodesofusingstochasticsisdivergences.A
divergence occurs when the price and stochastics diverge from following
roughly the same path. In other words, if the price makes a new high but
thestochasticsdon’t,youhaveadivergence.Ifthestochasticsmakeanew
highbutthepricedoesn’t,youhaveadivergence.Divergencesaremainly
usedtopredictandtradeachangeintrend.
The typical divergence is when the price makes a new low but the
stochasticsdon’torthepricemakesanewhighandthestochasticsdon’t.
In other words, the momentum of the price is less strong than the price
itself.
TherearenospecificentryandexitrulesbutI’llshowyouhowtouse
stochastic divergences to create massive profits. We’ll have to use other
techniquestoactuallycreatethetiming.We’llusestochasticstocreatethe
environmentformakingextramoney.
I have studied this type of divergence and have found that diver-
gences on the daily chart mean something different than divergences on
the weekly chart. Divergences on the daily chart typically mean only that
the market will likely have a short-term countertrend move. In general, I
lookforthemarkettochangedirectioninonetofivedays(butmostlikely
in two to three days) and have a one-to-five-day countertrend move (but
mostlikelyatwo-to-three-daycountertrendmove).
A weekly divergence usually means that an intermediate-term trend
change is about to happen. At the least, a weekly divergence means that
there will be a significant countertrend move. I think that the size of the
countertrendmovesonthedailychartisnotpowerfulenoughtoovercome
the countertrend nature of the trade as well as the problem of deciding
whenthecountertrendwillbegin.

On the other hand, the size of the projected weekly countertrend or
new trend move was substantial and very tradable. There still remained
the problem of being able to predict when the divergence would actually
create the resulting change in trend. Nonetheless, a weekly divergence is
farmoretradablethanadailydivergence.
It is a common belief that divergences do predict changes in trend,
even if only a short countertrend move. But it is important to realize that
you can’t simply buy or sell when the divergence occurs. In virtually all
cases, the market continues its trend for several more bars before suc-
cumbingtothepowerofthedivergence.Manytraderspointouthowgreat
divergencescalledhighsandlowsbutfew,ifany,arguethatthedivergence
actually lasted for some period of time before the price turned direction.
Let’slookatacoupleofexamples.
InFigure5.3,weseethepricemakeasignificantlowaboutninebars
fromtheleft(mid-December).Thestochasticsalsomakealow.However,
six bars later, the market makes a new low close while the stochastics

Note that I said a new low close, not a new low. That is because the
relationshipoftheclosestotheclosesistheimportantfactor,nottherela-
tionshipofthelowstothelows.Thisisbecausestochasticsarebasedon
theclosingprice.
Inthiscase,therewasstochasticdivergencebutthepricedidnotmake
a new significant low for three more bars. In our study, the divergence
came three days in advance of the actual bottom. We then measure the
distance from the actual bottom to the subsequent high to get an idea of

of daily divergences was random. This tends to reduce the value of daily
divergences.

I’m about to say something that is astounding and perhaps heretical:
Itcould bethatdivergences aresimply illusions. Perhaps wearecreating
a pattern where none exists. For example, I could create a system that
predictedacountertrendmovesoonaftereverydaynamedTuesday.Well,
sure enough, this system will call 98 percent of every countertrend move
within two weeks. In other words, only rarely will a market go two full

GO WITH THE TREND
I sometimes use stochastics as a mechanical trading system or as a trend
indicator. The basic rule is to buy when the %K stochastic crosses above
the50lineandsellwhenitcrossesbelowthe50line.Youarealwaysinthe
market.Iusethisruleonboththeweeklyanddailybars,butmainlyonthe
dailyones.
My experience is that the performance is similar to using any
intermediate-termtrend-followingsystem.Youwillgetchoppedupduring
sideways price action but will make major profits when the market gets
intoamajortrend.
Colby and Meyers tested this concept on NYSE Composite weekly
data. (See the Appendix for more information.) They add one additional
filter:The%Kandtheweeklyclosingpriceareabovetheirpreviousweek’s
level.Theirresultswerethatthiswasaprofitablesystemusingjustabout
any length of parameter. This shows that the method is robust. However,
profitswerebestnearthe45-weeklevel.
ColbyandMeyerspointoutthatonlyabout39percentoftradeswere
profitable. That is about what you would expect from any intermediate-
termtradingsystem.
Theconclusion:Thisisasolidtrend-followingsystemthatcanbeused
onbothweeklyanddailydata.Thepercentageoftradesthatarewinners
will be near 40 percent but the winners will be greater in size than the
losers.Onegreatadvantageofthismethodisthatitisfreewitheverychart-

modifymyalreadyexistingtradingmethods.
Weekly stochastics are far more powerful than daily ones since they
lead to either a significant retracement or a major trend change. My trad-
ing strategy here is to use them the same way I described using the daily
stochastics, but I will also become aggressive at finding an entry point in
the direction that the divergence is predicting. For example, let’s assume
that the market is moving higher but develops a bearish stochastic diver-
gence.Thatwouldpredictatleastastrongretracementthatisbigenough

ple, the market is heading higher but a divergence appears. I’ll get short
if I see something like a reversal bar down on the daily chart. It doesn’t
have to be much of a signal to get me short. I’ll also use that signal to
exit my position trades from techniques such as the Conqueror or trend
analysis.
INTERVIEW WITH GEORGE LANE

George Lane. He was quite old at the time and has since died. He was a

A: Some people say that when the stochastics first cross
80 percent that is a good time to buy and that is a good
trendsignal.
GL: That’s Jake Bernstein’s interpretation. He discovered, and
we have been teaching for 47-some years, that sometimes
stochastics goes on up to the top and the market keeps on
going.Inotherwords,there’sjustsodamnmuchmomentum

You see, if the market comes down and gives me a left-
handed crossover...I’m going to wait for the right-handed
crossover. But then K rallies and then comes back and
kisses D and then starts to go back up again. Now I have
a convergence in K only. So I jump on it and go. It means

We used RSI along with stochastics for several years

two oscillators so we just quit using RSI because we don’t
needit.

Okay, we are long. The exit of the position will always be the close
of trading on the breakout day. So, in this case, we make a modest profit
because the close of trading turns out to be higher than the high of the
insideday.
Let’snowlookatalosingtrade.GoovertoMarch20inFigure6.1.Here
we see another inside day. We put in our orders just as described earlier.
The price breaks to the upside and we get long. Unfortunately, the price
sags back and closes below the high of the inside day, which means that
the trade is a modest loser. In this case, the bulls had some strength but

have been written about buy and sell signals. Virtually every book is on
how to use a system to create profitable trading. But nobody talks about
what to do after the original trade is over. In particular, nobody tells you
whattodowhenthetradefails.
Averyoldtradingpreceptsaysthatafailedsignalisasignal.Soevery
trade that is a losing trade might be setting up a winning trade. Take a
look at every technique you are using and see if it is profitable for you to
reverseyourpositionwhenyougetstoppedoutofatrade.So,forexample,
suppose you are short using the super-duper widget system and you get
stopped out. What would happen if you were to reverse your position to
the long side? And perhaps hang on just until the end of the day? I’ll bet
youhaveanewprofitablesystem!
In this case, we are reversing our position whenever we get stopped
out using inside days. A stopped-out inside day trade is always a double
whammy.
Inside days tend to be profitable in about 55 percent of trades with
the average winning trade much larger than the average losing trade. But

techniques(seeChapter7formoreinformation).Butmosttraderswillbe
abletoputontwoormorecontractswhentheyenteraposition.Youcan
usethemultiunittechniqueaslongasyoucanentertwoormorecontracts.
Virtually all written material, including this book, assumes that you
will only have one contract on. Even if more contracts are assumed, it is
assumed that the entry and exit arethe same for both positions. But why

Inthiscase,let’sassumethatwehaveenoughmoneyinouraccountto

day technique. We would buy two contracts at that point. But instead of
holdingbothpositionsuntilthecloseoftrading,whichisthestandardexit,
we liquidate one of the two contracts when there is a 20-pip profit. We
carry the second position to the end of the trading day just as described
in the standard rules for this method. Does the multiunit tactic enhance
profits?Yes!
Let’s look at the three trades in Figure 6.1. On the first trade, on the
left, we make more money because we take off one of the two positions
nearthehighofthedayandthenthepricesagsbackdowntotheclose.We
enhancedprofitsslightlyhere.
Let’s take a look at the double whammy day in the middle. Here, we
short two contracts and take profits on one of them quickly. The market

the profit on the first contract essentially covers the loss on the second

REVERSAL DAYS
My second pattern recognition method is another classic: reversal days.
This is another technique that has been around for decades. And, once
again,I’llprovidesomeenhancementsforit.
The reversal day concept comes from the idea that it is important to
watchforsituationswhenthemarketstartsoffinonedirectiononagiven
daybutthenturnsaroundandmovessharplyintheotherdirection.
Let’s take a look at a typical Reversal Day. Figure 6.2 shows four
different reversal days marked with arrows. Let’s take a look at the
firstone.
AReversalDayoccurswhenapairmakesalowerlowthantheprevi-

the market makes a higher high than the previous day and closes lower.
The first arrow on the left is pointing to a bullish Reversal Day. You can
see that it made a lower low than the previous day but closed higher on
theday.Now,takealookatthedaybeforetheinsideday.Onthisday,the
market opened then traded up to the highs, showing that the bulls were
in control of the market early in the day. But the market closed near its
lows,showingthatthebearshadtakencontrolofthemarket.Thisbearish
control continues at the beginning of the inside day on February 20. The
market moves lower on a continuation of the bearish price action of the
February19.
But then the bulls start to take control. They come in with enough
powerthattheyareabletomoveabovethepreviousday’scloseandclose
higher for the day. In fact, they were so powerful that they were able to
even break above the high of February 19, though they weren’t able to
maintain that level. Still, it took a lot of buying power for the bulls to be
abletoturnthetideofthebearsfromthatdayandbullthemarkethigher.

RIDING THE REJECTION RULE
The third pattern-recognition technique is a unique method I call riding
the rejection rule, or RRR. Read about the rejection rule in Chapter 3 on
channelbreakoutsifyoudon’tremembertherejectionrule.Iamgoingto
showyouhowtoturnalosingtrade,triggeredbytherejectionrule,intoa
profitable trade. In effect, this method is another of our lemonade trades
becausewetakealosingtradeandturnitintoeitheraprofitabletrade,or
atleastlessofaloss.YoucanalsouseRRRasastand-alonetechniqueto
makemoney!
The basic concept of this technique came from my reading of Linda
BradfordRaschkeandLarryConnor’sbookStreetSmartTrading(M.Gor-
donPublishingGroup,1996).TheyoutlinedatechniquecalledTurtleSoup.
ThatwasthegenesisofRRR.
RaschkeandConnornoticedthatmarketsoftenfailtofollowthrough

The4WRwasthenadaptedbytheTurtles(agroupoftraders,onlysomeof
whom have ever been named). Raschke and Connors feltthatthe market
wouldoftengotothesebreakoutlevelsandfail.TheTurtlemodifications
didn’treallyaddressthisissue.
So Raschke and Connors thought that they should trade the failed
breakouts. Remember that I told you that a failed signal is a signal. RRR
isatechniqueforfindingfailedsignalsandthenjumpingonthem.Weare
looking for a breakout that fails and then profiting from that failure. The

RiskManagement 107
First, let’s assume that we bet $10 on every flip of the coin. That’s
10 percent of our bankroll of $100. What are the chances that we will get
wiped out sometime during our 1,000 coin flips? Turns out that we have
over a 90 percent chance of getting wiped out. The reason is that all we
need is a net of 10 losing trades and we are wiped out. And there is over
a90percentchancethatwewillgetthatconditionsometimeduringthose
1,000flips.
Now,let’sonlybet$1oneachflip.Whatarethechancesnowthatyou

becausenowweneedtogetanetof100losingcoinflipsinthe1,000flips
andthechancesofthatareverysmall.
One of the key factors to consider is that the return and risk are
asymmetrical. How can that be when the odds are 50–50 on each coin
flip? Shouldn’t I always end up with roughly $100 at the end of the
game?Nope!
Let’s simplify the game for purposes of demonstration. Let’s assume
thatyouaregoingtobet$100oneachcoinflip.Unfortunately,youlosethe

That is the situation we have with trading. You may have a good sys-
tem, but getting wiped out means you don’t get to trade anymore to take
advantage ofthat good system. But making money inthe beginning helps
youfromgettingwipedoutbutdoesn’tcompletelyeliminatetheprospect.
As a result, we need to have proper risk management to make sure that

HOW TO MAKE SURE WE ARE
NEVER WIPED OUT
TherewasafamousGreekphilosophernamedZeno.Hedevelopedsome-
thing that has come to be known as Zeno’s Paradox. I like to use it as an
example of how the methods that I’m going to show you ensure that you
don’tgetwipedout.
Zeno presented thefollowingsituation: Anarcher shoots anarrowto
atarget.Atsomepoint,thearrowreachesahalfwaypoint.Okay,fromthat
halfway point to the target there is another halfway point. And from that
new halfway point to the target is a farther halfway point. How can the
arroweverreachthetarget?
I can’t answer that paradox but I do know that we can use a similar
idea when designing a risk management scheme. We can make sure that
ourequitynevergetswipedout.

FIXED FRACTIONAL

imum on the first three trades. You will lose $1,000 on the first trade,

It should now be no surprise that you will only risk $980 on your next

RiskManagement 109
HOW MANY CONTRACTS SHOULD
I PUT ON?
Suppose you have $100,000 in your trading account and you are risking 1
percent on each trade. You see a great trend analysis trade developing. It
turns out that you will have to risk $750 on the trade per contract. How
manycontractsshouldyouputon?
Basically,youtaketheriskthatyouareallowedforthatcurrencypair
and divide the risk per contract into that risk. That gives you the number
ofcontractsthatyouareallowed.
The rule is that you can only risk 1 percent of your $100,000 on each
trade. That means that you can only put on one contract since you are
allowed to risk $1,000 and each contract is a risk of $750. Thus, risking
two contracts would be $1,500 and that would be too much risk for the
portfolio.Soyouonlydoonecontract.
Don’tchangethestopjustbecauseyouwanttodotwocontracts.You
shouldalwayspicktheoptimalstoppointandthenseehowmanycontracts
youareallowedtobuy,nottheotherwayround!
The risk management rule is there to make sure you stick tothe self-
disciplinenecessarytomakemoneyinthemarketsandnotgetblownout
byafewbadtrades.
Oneofthepotentialproblemswithrestrictingyourriskthiswayisthat
youneedtohavealargebankroll.Itishardtotradeforexusingstandard
contracts without risking at least $750 per contract. That means that you
must have $75,000 in your account to stick to the 1 percent rule. Many
tradersdonothavethatmuchmoneyintheiraccounts.
So you have two choices. First is to trade the mini- or even micro-
contracts that are available from many brokers. This means that you will
berisking$75onamini-contractratherthan$750onastandardcontract.
Note also that using a mini-contract allows you to take any intermediate
amount of risk up to your risk limit. The second choice is to earn more
moneytodepositintoyouraccount.
HIGHLY CORRELATED POSITIONS
Based on the risk management rules, you cannot be trading highly cor-
related pairs as if they were separate positions. For example, EUR/USD,
USD/CHF,andGBP/USDarehighlycorrelated.Youshouldapplythe1per-

There is a concept called the law of large numbers. A Swiss mathe-
matician, Jakob Bernoulli, developed this in a treatise published in 1713.

He proposed that the expectation of a particular series approaches the
ideal the larger the numbers being used. Let me translate. Let’s say that
wehaveamethodthatwins45percentofthetimeandtheaveragewinner
is2.2timestheaverageloser.Thosenumberswillonlybetrueinthelong
run. Perhaps we only make three trades. All of them could be winners or
all could be losers. That is not even close to the expectation of winning
45percentofthetime.However,thelawoflargenumberssaysthattrade
this method 100,000 times and the number of winners will be very, very
closetotheideal45percent.
Let’slookatanotherconcept:expectedvalue.Theexpectedvalue,or
EV, of a trade is simply the percent chance of winning times the average
sizeofawinningtrademinusthepercentchanceoflosingtimestheaver-
agesizeofalosingtrade.
EV=(%W∗AvgWinner)−(%L∗AvgLoser)
Simple!
But here’s the key concept: Virtually everybody looks at every trade
equally. I put on a channel breakout trade in EUR/JPY and another trade
inUSD/CHFusingtrendanalysis.Ilookateachofthosetradesasequal.I
willriskexactlythesameforeachtrade.PerhapsIwillrisk0.5percenton
eachofthem.
But those two trades are not equal. Perhaps one technique is better
than the other technique. Perhaps one of the markets is in a well-defined
trend and the other is drifting sideways. It makes more sense to weight
bettertradeswithalargerposition.
Anotherwayofdescribingriskmanagementisassetallocation.Where

will always want to invest in the best investments with larger positions

someveryinterestingconcepts.
Basically, the Kelly Formula is telling us that we should put on a
position large enough that we would lose 22 percent of our portfolio if
there was an average loss. This may seem like an extraordinary amount
of risk. And it is. But Kelly is based on maximizing profit, not finding a
balance between risk and reward or trying to get the most conservative
position.
Note that each trade loss would be 22 percent of the remaining port-
folio. So we are effectively stopped from getting wiped out but we could
suffer greatly. For example, we have our $100,000 account. I used the ex-
ampleoflosingthemaximumof1percentwhenusingfixedfractional,soa

basedonaverageloss,notmaximumloss.Thismeansthatyoumayactu-
allylosemuchmoreifthemaximumlossishit.
The idea of using the average loss works just fine in the context of
gambling because the maximum loss and the average loss are often the
same.Youbet$2onanagandloseandtheaveragelossandthemaximum
lossarethesame.
Buttradingisdifferent.Theaveragelossisusuallylessthanhalfofthe
maximum loss. So we can’t use Kelly as is. We need to modify it to take
intoaccountthissignificantdifference.Wemightotherwisefindourselves
in deep trouble. I would also suggest that it would be psychologically de-
bilitatingtotakesuchlargelosses.
One of the keys to using Kelly is to realize that it is a way to ratio-
nally determine the relative value of differing trades. Suppose that Kelly
saysyoushouldrisk22percentonthisparticularpairusingthisparticular
techniqueandsaysyoushouldrisk11percentonadifferentpairusingthe
sametechnique.Thisclearlymeansthatyoushouldrisktwiceasmuchon
thefirsttradeasthesecondtrade.
Perhaps that means that you use Kelly to modify the fixed fractional.
Inthiscase,perhapsyoutake2percentriskonthefirsttradeand1percent
onthesecond.
I suggest that you do not use the pure Kelly but use what is called a
fractional Kelly.ThemostpowerfulfractionalKellyisahalf-Kelly,which
is when you put on a position half of what is recommended by Kelly. By
doingthis,itreducesyourriskby50percentbutonlyreducesyourreward
byafewpercent.Yourrisk-adjustedreturnactuallygoesup.Still,thismay
meanthatyouareriskingover10percentonagiventrade.
Another way to modify Kelly is to use maximum loss in the calcula-
tioninsteadoftheaverageloss.Inotherwords,taketheKellypercentbut
divideintothelargestloss,nottheaverageloss,andyouwillbemuchmore
conservative.
SohowshouldyouuseKelly?Here’swhatIdo.
First, I keep very good records of all my trades. That way I can see
whattheperformanceisofeverytechniqueandcurrencypair.Thatrecord

I don’t make any decisions on risk management until I have at least
30trades.Inaddition,IreallywouldpreferthatIhave30tradesindiffer-
ent types of markets. How well does this technique/pair work in trending
markets or sideways markets? With 30 trades, I can start to make some
rationaldecisions.
Second,IusetheKellyweightingstochangemyfixedfractionaltrade

BEWARE OF TAKING PROFITS
TOO EARLY
“You can’t go broke taking a profit” is something I’ve heard many times
overthelast30years.ButwhatI’vefoundisthatyoucangobroketaking
aprofit.
Every method has a certain number of losses and a certain num-
ber of gains. That is the nature of every method. There can be variances
around that number for short periods of time but not over the long run.
Let’s go back to our example of losing $1.00 on each losing trade and
making $2.50 on each winning trade and 45 percent of our trades are
winners.
Weknowthroughsimplemaththatthisisawinningmethod.Butwhat
ifwetookprofitseverytimewehada$1.00profit?Thatwouldmakethisa
money-losingmethodimmediately.Wearelosingonmoretradesthanwe
are winning so making/losing equal amounts of money on each trade is a
surefirewaytolosemoney.
Realistically,though,takingquickprofitswilllikelyboostthenumber
ofwinningtradestolosingtrades.Thismaybeenoughtomakethisaprof-
itable system. However, we would have to boost the number of winning
tradescomparedtothelosingtradesbyalargeamounttoequaltheprofits
oftheoriginalratio.
Allmethodshavelosingtrades.Thatisthepriceofplayingthegame.
We need a certain number of winning trades of a certain size to pay for
thoselosses.Thewinningtradesthatarebeyondthatlevelcreatetheprofit
forus.
Everymethodhasanaturalprofileofwinningandlosingtrades,their
size and frequency. Let’s assume that you are using a winning method.
Cutting the size of the winners will usually cause a higher number of
winnersbutatamuchsmallersize.Imaycutthesizeofthewinnerfrom
$2.50 to $1.00. The average size of my winner is now just 40 percent of
theprevious size.ThatmeansthatImusthave150percentmorewinners
thanIdidbeforetoequalthedollarsthatIhadmadebeforeinmytrading.
RememberthatIwasmakingonly45percentofmytradesasprofitswith
theremainderbeinglosses.Adding150percentofthe45percentwinners
wouldmeanthatIwouldhavetohavemorewinnersthanIhavetradesto
equaltheprofitsoftheoriginalmethod.That’simpossible.
Basically, the base method lost on slightly more than 50 percent of
the trades but the winning trades were 2.5 times the size of the losing
trades. It is impossible to make as much money as this method if I cut
the profits to only 1 times the size of the losing trades because I would
have to have more winning trades than I have trades to make that much
money.

122 HOWTOMAKEALIVINGTRADINGFOREIGNEXCHANGE
It comes back to the old trading adage of letting your profits run and
cuttingyourlosses.
We need to be careful when we take profits too early. Most of the
techniques in this book are trend-following techniques. That means that
we want to follow the trend as long as it is trending. Generally, we have
no idea of how far a trend will go. So we want to give that method
as much room as possible to let the trend make us as much money as
possible.
Basically, we let the trend run until we are stopped out. I have said
that protective stops should have two attributes. First, they should filter
outrandomnoise.Wedon’twanttobestoppedoutbecauseofsomeblip
in the market, only because something significant has happened. Second,
weonlywanttobestoppedoutwhenwearewrong.
Inthecaseofatrend-followingtechnique,weonlywanttobestopped
outwhenthetrendisnolongerourfriendandthemarkethasturnedneu-
tral or bearish. So why would we ever want to take profits before getting
stopped out? There are two reasons: psychological profits and confirma-
tions.We’llexplorebothinthepagesthatfollow.
PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFITS

One solution to psychological stress is to boost the number of win-

reinforcement that comes from having a winning streak increases. Even

CONFIRMATIONS
Aconfirmationcomeswhenasignaloccursandthereisanotherindicator

an example of a confirmation. The ADX must be climbing to confirm the
breakoutsignalof,say,channelbreakout.Ineffect,theremustbetwosig-

Confirmations are an important concept because you are effectively
making sure that the original signal is correct before taking action. This

MAXIMUM EXCURSION ANALYSIS
Ifirstranacrosstheideaofmaximumexcursionanalysis(MEA)fromKent
Calhoun.Hedidn’tcallitthatbutItooktheideafromhimandmadeitmore
general than what he was doing. He basically looked at different types of
technicalsignalsinfutures,suchasheadandshouldersorbreakouts,and
measuredhowmuchdidthefuturescontractgoafterthatsignal.
For example, how far did the market move after breaking the 55-day
high? (It is actually more difficult to answer this question than it sounds.
Whatobjectivecriteriawillyouusetodeterminethefarthestthattheprice
went? Oh, it went up 500 pips. But what about the 5,000 pips it went up
over the next year? Do you count that as part of this signal or is that just
drift in the price?) However you determine this, it will form a classic bell
curve.
One of the problems in Kent’s method is that he plotted the absolute
price changes that came from a signal. That meant that a signal when
EUR/USD is 1.5000 was treated the same as when it was 0.8000. Clearly,
the moves will be bigger when the price is higher than when it is lower.
However, thepercentage move willlikelybeabout the same. Soweneed
to adjust the maximum excursion to the price level. This can be done by
simplytrackingthemaximumexcursionsaspercentsratherthanasabso-
lutepricemovements.
So now you have adjusted everything to percentages. You will now

Slingshot 125
There is another amazing idea that comes from MEA: You can turn
losingtechniquesintowinners.
There are a million trading techniques out there. Most of them are
garbage.Theyareconsistentlosers.ButtheprincipleofMEAcanturnthem
intowinners.
Typically, a trading method has an entry and an exit rule. They are
usually the same rule. For example, a moving average crossover method
willbuywhentheshortermovingaveragecrossesabovethelongermoving
average and then reverse and go short when the shorter moving average
crossesbelowthelongermovingaverage.Thiscanbeaprofitablemethod
if the length of the moving averages are correct but can also be a losing
techniqueifthelengthiswrong.
Iknow that the 5/10 moving average crossover is a money-losing sys-
tem.(Golongwhenthefive-daymovingaveragecrossesabovethe10-day
moving average and go short when the five-day moving average crosses
belowthe10-daymovingaverage.)Youshouldneverusethissystem.But

itable.)Thisisastoundingbecausewehaveturnedanunprofitabletrading

I’ve not seen anyone really do any research into the use of MEA as a
means of creating and/or enhancing profits of trading techniques. In fact,
remember the multiunit tactic for the inside days technique (Chapter 6)

WHY DO YOU TRADE?
I ask the audience members why they trade. Of course, the answer is to
makemoney.Iaskthemiftheyarereallysure.Bythistime,theyarestart-
ingtosecond-guesstheirfirstanswer.But,inthefinalanalysis,theystick
with their answer: that they are trading so that they can make money. I
think that that is completely wrong. I think that people trade for tons of
otherreasonsandthatmakingmoneyisarelativelyminorreason.Nobody
reallyknowswhyeachindividualpersontradesbuttherearemanyreasons
otherthanmakingmoney.
Ifirstdiscoveredthisabout20yearsago.Backinthe1970s,Imanaged
futures money with a partner. We offered two different accounts to our
prospectiveclients.Thefirstaccounttradedonlycommodityspreadsand
was making 200 percent per year while the second account traded only
outrightpositionsandwasmakingabout100percentperyear(pleasenote
that these returns were so high because I didn’t know as much as I do
nowaboutriskandmoneymanagementandweweresimplytakingfartoo
muchrisk).
Of course, everybody opened up a spread account because it was
making 200 percent per year. Within six months, nearly everybody had
shifted their account to the outright program in spite of the fact that it
returned only half as much! This stunned us because we always assumed
thatpeopleinvestedinfuturestomakemoney.Infact,theywereinvolved,
Ibelieve,fortheaction.Theywouldcallusupwhentheywereinvestedin
the spread account and ask how their account was doing. We would
respond that they made $12.50 the previous day because a back spread
in the corn market has moved one-quarter of a cent. On the other hand,
they would call about their outright account and we could say that the
value of the account had moved $1,000 because of some big move in the
bellies.
The point is that they wanted the action of the futures markets, not
the profits. Their primary motivation was action and making money was
secondary. It’s okay to pay to see a movie because of the entertainment

It’s interesting to note that nearly all the articles and books written
about forextradingareabout entryand exittechniques. Yet tradingtech-
niques developed by Richard Donchian in the 1960s have been shown to
make money for every year since then. We already know techniques that
make money, yet 90 percent of traders lose money. Odd? Yes! It is clear
to me that it is more important for many people to continue to figure out

The point of this is that my guest lecturer was far more interested in
beingrightthaninmakingmoney.
This is one of the critical concepts necessary to become a profitable
trader.Youmustfocusonmakingmoney,notonbeingright.Infact,super-
analyst Ned Davis once wrote a slim book called Being Right or Making
Money.Noticethatit’snotcalledBeingRightandMakingMoney.Toboth
ofus,tryingtoberightisablocktomakingmoney.
Trying to be right means that your ego iswrapped up in the outcome
of the trade. You will, therefore, have the tendency to want to hold onto
losers longer than you should. They will become larger than they should

selves as people. Having a winning trade is a way to validate themselves
and make them feel good about themselves. It shows them that they are
smartandcleverbecausetheywereabletopegthemarket.
I once did a session with a new mentoring student of mine. I spent
the first three sessions dealing only with the psychology of trading. His
background is in the mental health profession so he was very self-aware.

Trying to be right also creates a tendency to cause overanalysis of a
position. Some traders will overanalyze a position to make sure that they
are right and then end up missing the move. They were never wrong, but
theydidn’tmakeanymoney.

I think that this list can be grouped into three major categories: lack

fallintotwocategories.
I can’t say that where I place each of these reasons is the final word.
Some of these reasons flow between different categories. I think that not

irrelevant because what we really want to do is focus on the three main
categoriesandhowtodealwiththem.
Thethreemaincategoriesarelackofdiscipline,knowledge,andcap-
ital. The latter two are probably the easiest to deal with and lack of dis-
cipline is usually the hardest. Why? Because it involves a change in your
character. Money and knowledge can always be acquired, but changing

They knew they had no goal, plan, and/or confidence but hadn’t
done anything to correct this potentially fatal flaw in their trading. Why
not? I believe that the answer lies first in the discussion of why people
trade.Perhaps—andthisislikelytheproblem—makingmoneyisnottheir
priority.
But let’s assume that this is not the case and that they really are mo-
tivated to make money trading forex. I think then that the problem is a
lack of self-discipline. Once again, they know the problem but have not
conquered it.Solving these kindsofproblems requiresaninsight intothe
problem, a plan to solve the problem, and the self-discipline to apply the
solution.
Clearly,peoplehaveaninsightintotheproblemortheywouldn’thave

ADDRESSING A LACK OF CAPITAL
A lack of capital means that you are overtrading and risking too much of

Thefirstsolutionobviouslyrequiresyoutoeitherearnandsavemoney
ortoallocatemoreofyourcurrentassetstoforextrading.Thesecondsolu-
tioniseasytodoaswell.However,theproblemcomeswhenyouraccount
is very small, such as under $10,000. It’s easy to find lots of interesting
trades when your account has $250,000 but much harder when you only
have$5,000.
A detailed description of money management concepts is beyond the
scope ofthisbook.However, let’sassume thatyourisk1percentofyour

There are several solutions. First, save and invest more money. The
more money you have in the account, the more you can risk per trade.
For example, using a 1 percent bet size, you could risk $200 on a $20,000
account, $500 on a $50,000 account and so on. There are obviously a lot
moretradeopportunitieswhenyoucanrisk$500thanwhenyourisk$100.
A second alternative is to risk more per trade. For example, risk
2 percent or 3 percent of your equity on each trade. This will give you

many more opportunities to make money but it will increase the risk
ofruin.
Sometimes this is the only alternative. You take more risk than you
should in order to play the game. However, the greater the risk you take,
the greater the chance that you get wiped out. It’s sort of like “double or
nothing.”Ontheotherhand,prudentmoneymanagementmeansthatyou
are much more likely to succeed and that you are treating trading forex

He casually replied, “I like to keep the risk to a third or less of my

say that he bet a third of his total bankroll on each trade? I had to
ask again and he stated that this was the case. He seemed proud of his
conservatism!

Inmycareer,Ihavehiredmanypeopletobetradersforme.Manyhad

tion that they had self-discipline. Had they been in the Marines or other

It has been my experience that Marines and athletes are represented
far beyond their normal representation in society in the numbers of suc-
cessful traders. Why? Because it takes tremendous self-discipline to be
successfulinthosetwoareas.
NoticethatIdonotlookforpeoplewhoknowalotaboutforextrading

Ihopetodointherestofthechapter.
Unfortunately, self-discipline is not something that can be taught. It
has to come from within. Nobody can create self-discipline for you. This
sounds reflexive: You must have self-discipline to acquire self-discipline.
To a certain extent, this is true. This chapter will not teach you self-
discipline; only you can do that. However, it is often possible to pick
up techniques or tricks that can boost your self-discipline. You may find
that some of the following techniques provide the impetus toward self-
discipline.Somemayworkforyouandotherswillfallflat.

I believe that trading success is built on the excellent execution of a
few fundamentals. You don’t need to get fancy, just focus on the funda-
mentals. I think that you will find that most of your losing trades come
frombreakingafewfundamentalrules,suchasnotplacingandstickingto
apresetstoplosslevel.
Switching the focus onto learning and away from profits and losses
helps to reduce the emotions associated with trading. You can look at
each trade much more objectively because you almost don’t care if you
madeorlostmoney.Inacuriousway,youmighteven“enjoy”losingtrades
more than winning trades because you can usually learn more from the
experience.
Noticethatthispointofviewhelpstopromotegoodtradingpractices.
Remember, you should be noting everything you did right in the trade as
well as what you did wrong. This will reinforce behavior that produces
profitabletrades.Inaway,thedefinitionofagood tradechanges.Atrade
becomes a good trade when you learn something new, not only when it
makesmoney.
Notice how powerful a different mind-set can be. Making or losing
money on a given trade becomes no big deal. Instead, you try to analyze
yourtradingdispassionatelytoseehowtoimprove.Youarealmostforced
tobeobjective.
The flip side is that a tremendous pressure will be taken off of you.
You are no longer judged (by yourself) by the success or failure of your
lasttrade.Thepressureofsuccessisreplacedbythepressuretoimprove

okay, but few people have the self-discipline to simply follow a system.

STRESS-FREE TRADING
Oneofthekeystoprofitabletradingistoreducestress.Mostofthischapter
is about techniques to reduce or eliminate stress. Stress is unhealthy and
getsinthewayofprofitabletrading.Oneofthekeystoreducingstressis
tothinkintermsofprobabilitiesratherthaninabsolutes.
Think of the stress when you put on a trade and naturally think, “I’m
goingtomakemoneyonthistrade.”Thatiswhatwenormallythinkwhen
weputonatrade.Actually,weshouldbethinking,“I’mprobablygoingto
makemoneyonthistrade.”
The first statement will create a lot of stress if you have a losing
trade.Youinternallypredictedsomethingthatdidn’tcometrue.Youwere
wrong. You don’t want to be wrong. You feel stress. The second state-
ment creates far less stress if you have a losing trade. You predicted
that you would make money but you also predicted that there was a fair
chancethatyouwouldlosemoney.Youweresortarightandsortawrong.
Bigdeal.
I turn a profit on less than 50 percent of my trades but I am still
a money-making trader. So my internal prediction is, “I’ll probably lose
money on this trade but I will make money on my trading.” How much
less stress is that? I’m actually predicting that I will lose money on this

As traders, we must be both humble and bold at the same time. We
mustbehumbleandrealizethatwewillhavemanylosingtrades,hundreds

At the same time, we must be bold so that we have the courage and

BE THE CASINO
In my trading classes, I ask my students how many of them have been to
acasinoandgambled.Themajoritywillraisetheirhands.Ithenaskthose
whoconsistentlymakemoneytoleavetheirhandsintheair.
Allthehandsgodown.
Itisalwaysastoundingtometoseethatsomanypeoplegotoacasino

They say that it is the thrill that they might win. Might! Of course I chide
themforthislackofdiscipline.ButthenIaskthemiftheythinkthecasino
makes money every year. Of course, the answer is yes. Casinos rarely go
bellyup.Icanseethestudents’eyeslightup.

Wewanttoonlyusetradingmethodsthatmakemoney.Thecasinoisnever

Wemustdothesame.
Just because the casino has an edge still doesn’t mean that it is guar-
anteed to make money. It still must execute flawlessly to ensure profits.
Imagine the owner of a casino getting up one day and deciding that he
didn’tliketheblackjackdealersandappointedmeandyoutodothedeal-
ingthisweek.Well,Iimaginethatyouarelikemeanddon’tknowhowto

that he has had a losing trade for three straight months by having to pay
forelectricitytolightthecasino.Heflinchesonthefourthmonthbecause
hedoesn’twantanotherlosingtradeanddoesn’tpaythebill.
This casino is clearly going out of business soon. Yet the casino
has to deal with many of the same issues that we do as professional
traders. It must only play games in which it has an edge and it must
execute flawlessly. In my example, the casino owner was not executing
flawlessly.
My examples may seem absurd but they are not so absurd when we
individual traders examine our own behavior. We do the same kinds of
dumb behavior all the time. When you sit down at a roulette table, does
thecasinoownergetfearful?Doesheflinchandstopyoufromgambling?
Moreimportant,doeshegetupsetwhenhelosesaspin?Ortwo?Orthree?
No! The bottom line is that the casino owner doesn’t care what hap-
pens on the next spin or the next or the next. What he cares about is the
next 1,000 spins or the next million spins. He knows that the next spin is
notrelevanttohisprofitabilityattheendofthemonth.Hecouldnotcare

quandary over what to do or if you are feeling some emotion related to

DEVELOPING YOUR TRADING PLAN
Perhaps the most powerful technique for increasing self-discipline is the

Traderslosemoneymostlyfrommakingstupidmistakes.Theyforget
to put in the stop because they will do it tomorrow. They don’t know the
right contract size. They like the way the stochastics are acting but com-
pletely ignore the breakdown on the chart. And so on. In other words,

tivitywhentheyareonthefiringlineandmoneyiscommitted.
The trading plan also helps to educate you. After a trade, you can go
overyourtradingplansandevaluatewhatactuallyhappened.Thisiscalled
the postmortem. You have an opportunity to examine how accurate the
pretrade analysis was and discover areas of weakness in your own edu-
cation or insights. Often, investors will realize that certain facets of their
tradingtechniquehavebeenover-orunderestimated.Theythinkthatapar-
ticulartechniqueisdoingwellwhen,infact,itisdoingpoorly.Traderscan
refer back to the trading plan while in the trade to determine whether
things are going as planned and whether there have been significant
changes that will affect the analysis that led to initiating the position.
The trading plan thus becomes a rudder for the average speculator, who
tends to trade like a rudderless ship. When investors are forced to com-
mit thoughts to paper before initiating the trade, their thoughts must be
morelogicalandcoherent.Therecordofthethoughtsbeforethetradeis

One of the key reasons why I recommend this approach to nonpro-

we lose objectivity once we are in a position. Our minds are blown. We

KEEP GOOD RECORDS

It doesn’t really matter why this is but it is a rather perplexing fac-

ourselves.Goodrecordkeepingisagoodstartforthis.
Therearetwomainreasonsforkeepinggoodrecordsofourtrading:
1. Accountabilityandanalysis
2. Constantimprovement
I advocate using at least several systems. We need to keep track of
their results. We need to know the total profitability, the number of win-

average size of the losers as a bare minimum of information. This infor-

I don’t like paper trading because it doesn’t address the real issues
of trading, which are psychology and risk management. Everybody can
trade reasonably well with paper money. But few can trade well in the
realworld.
Proponents of paper trading suggest that it allows the trader to prac-
tice the techniques before making a mistake in the real world that could
cause real financial loss. True. But I recommend back-testing instead. In

After back-testing, you will have practice and confidence in a short

I recommend that you start out trading with miniscule risk, perhaps only
0.25 percent. Trade with this incredibly low risk for several months.

If trading is exciting, then you are likely to get excited, and getting

One advantage that I have is that I am a scientific person. So what

Epilogue 169
KEEP YOUR TRADING TO
15 MINUTES A DAY
I recommend trading only 15 minutes a day. This is heretical in the trad-
ing community. They usually believe that you should chain yourself to a
computer and stare at it all day. Apparently, staring at a screen creates
profits.Isayitcreatesaheadache.
Sure, day trading can be fun. It can even be profitable. But the big
money is made on the big moves. There has never been a day trader
who made $100 million. But there are quite a few position traders who
havemadethatmuch.
I discovered this key to profitable trading through an epiphany I had
in the late 1980s. I was trading more than 40 different systems. I was
spending all day long feeding my systems. Part of the reasons for using
computer-generatedsystemswastocutdowntheamountoftimetrading.
Yet here I was spending 12 hours a day making sure that the data were
getting entered right, the systems were calculating right, and so on.
IrealizedthatIwasspendingwaytoomuchtimetradingthesesystems.
Iwasreallygettingintothe80/20Principle,alsocalledtheParetoPrin-
ciple, at the time. That Principle essentially says that 80 percent of the
resultsofsomethingwillcomefromjust20percentoftheactions.Forex-
ample,80percentofthesalesofacompanywillcomefrom20percentof
thecustomers.Inthiscase,80percentoftheprofitswerefrom20percent
ofthesystems.Actually,about90percentwascomingfrom10percentof
thesystems!
So I cut out 90 percent of my systems and found myself with very
little work to do. A little while later, I extended my analysis of my trad-
ing and split my trading into two parts: day trading and position trading.
Daytradingistradinganythingunderadayandpositiontradingisholding

This analysis forced me to confront the fact that I was really mak-
ing money on just a few methods that took very little time. I could drop
everything and spend just a few minutes a day and yet make almost as

MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ENOUGH CAPITAL
A critical consideration with trading is the amount of capital that you
have to trade. What is the right amount to have to trade? The more, the
better.
Iconsiderthathaving$100,000tostart,andusingthemethodsoutlined
inthisbook,willensurethatyouwillbeaprofitabletrader.Infact,youcan
startwithmuchless.
The real key is to make sure that you have enough capital to have a
diversified portfolio yet keep your risk within the limits recommended in
thisbook.
For example, let’s assume that you have $5,000 to start trading. Let’s
say that you are setting your risk limit at 1 percent. That means that you
canonlyrisk$50onatrade.Thatprobablymeansthatyoucanonlytrade
amicro-accountwhereeachpipisworthjust10cents.Alossof100pipsis
$10,whileonamini-accountthatwouldbe$100.
The purpose of the micro-account, in this case, is that you can trade
justabouteverysignalthatcomes.Youwouldlikelyonlybeabletotradea
fewtradesifyouweretobetradingamini-account.Reducingthenumber
of trades will obviously cut the total profits at the end of the year but it
alsoincreasesriskbecauseyourtradingprofitsandlossesarefocusedon

FUNDAMENTALS VERSUS TECHNICALS
Inevertalkedaboutusingfundamentalanalysistotradetheforexmarket.
Frankly, it is too difficult and subtle to teach very well, particularly in a
book. In addition, it is not necessary to know the fundamentals to make
money.IdoteachfundamentalanalysistomylivestudentsbecauseIcan
goextensivelyintothenuancesoftradingthatway.
The good news is that it is not important to know fundamentals to
makemoneytradingforex.Fundamentalsandtechnicalscanbothbeprof-
itableorunprofitable.Buttheyhaveverydifferentattributes.
Fundamentalscanbeverygoodatdeterminingthevalueofacurrency
pair.Knowingthatapairisworth1.60whenitistrading1.40isveryvalu-
ableinformation.Knowingthatwillcausemetotradethatpaironlyfrom
the long side. Fundamentals can also give us a lot of confidence in our
positions because we have a firm understanding of what is going on. In
addition,fundamentalanalysiscanenableustodifferentiatebetweendif-
ferent potential trades. “This trade is better than that trade because the
fundamentalsaremorebullish.”
But fundamentals have some serious problems. The biggest one is
when your analysis is wrong. Then that confidence becomes a deathtrap.
That pair is worth 1.60 and the market is 1.40. I should buy. The market
movesdownto1.30.Ishouldmortgagemyhouse.Themarketdriftseven
lower to 1.20. I should sell my kids. At 1.10, I’m bankrupt. To paraphrase
John Maynard Keynes, the market can remain irrational longer than you
canremainsolvent.
Technicalsarealsobothgoodandbad.Onebadfactoristhatyoucan’t
differentiate between trades. A breakout in two different pairs has to be
treatedasthesame.
The best thing about technical analysis is that it gives you a place to
put a stop. And that is very powerful. In fact, that one simple factor is of
incredibleimportance.Letmedemonstrate.

HOW TO PREDICT THE NEWS
I am constantly being asked by my students if they should hold an exist-
ing position into a major economic release, such as Non-Farm Payrolls. I
always say yes, if there is a clear trend and your trend is in line with the
trend.Thereasonisthatitisfairlyeasytopredictthenews!Letmeexplain.
There is only bullish news in bull markets; only bearish news in bear
markets;andamixinneutralmarkets!Iknow,Iknow,soundstoosimple.

By holding bullish positions into numbers that should be bullish, you
shouldbegainingincrementalprofits.Notbigmoneybutcertainlyagreater
profit than you would by bailing out of positions before big economic
numbers.
Thedownsideisthatyouwillhavesomebiggerswingsinthemarket.
In addition, there will be few instances where the news item will create
enoughvolatilitythatyouwillbestoppedoutofyourpositiononlytosee
themarketrallyafteryouhavebeenstoppedout.Fortunately,thisisrare,
butitwillhappen.
Inthemeantime,youwillbegainingaseriesofsmalltomoderateprof-
itsfromholdingpositionsintoeconomicnews.
The same principle makes it easy to outperform the gurus in predict-
ingtheeconomicnumbers.Takethemidpointofpredictionsandthenyou
should predict something reasonable on the bullish side of predictions.
Let’s say that the market is predicting a 0.3 percent gain in widget pro-
duction with 0.2 percent as bullish and 0.4 percent as bearish. It is a bull
market in the currency pair you are trading. You should therefore simply
make a prediction of, say, 0.1 percent. You will probably be closer to the
actualnumberthantheconsensusfigureof0.3percentandthereforemake
moneyandbebetterthaneconomists!
Thisphenomenonoccursbecauseanalystsarealwaysslightlybehind
reality.Theyspendtheirtimetryingtocatchuptowhatisreallygoingon.
Letmeprovethis.
Let’smakejustoneassumptionandthatisthatanalystsandthemarket
haveequalideasoftheupcomingnumbertobereleased.Ifthemarkethad
perfectpresciencethenthepriceofacurrencypairwouldnevermovebe-
causethemarketwouldknowexactlywhatisgoingtohappenandwould
find the correct price for the pair to discount that information. However,
note that markets move in waves up and down and sideways. This is the
market’sattempttofindouttheunderlyingvalueofthepair.
A trend in a market is caused by the underlying value of a currency
pairmoving,inthisexample,higherbutthemarketnotseeingtheendre-
sult.Themarketthereforechurnshigher,tryingtodiscountthechangein

one-timeshifttoanewhigherlevel.
Therefore, it is easy to predict news items because you are simply

ket. A piece of news comes out, the news is bullish, and the price moves
higher.
Youwillnowbeabletooutperformtheguruswhomakemillionspre-

world and you will see that you will outperform the consensus of predic-
tors.Amazing,buttrue!

“C ourtney Smith has hit it out of the park with this book. Not only
does he provide great insight into both the inner workings of the
marketplace and original trading methodologies, but he also devotes
much discussion to the often overlooked, immensely important aspects
of trading such as money management, discipline, and psychology.
After all, as he aptly opines, these are demons traders must slay to
be successful.”
—TOM DeMARK, Founder, Market Studies, Inc.
“ I learned a long time ago if Courtney Smith writes it, I read it. Glad
I did. I picked up three great insights in my fi rst read-through.”
