I
metRobertMinernotlongafterthemarketcrashofOctober1987.Ireluctantlywent
toatradingconference indowntown Chicago where hewas one ofmany speakers.
IwasreluctanttoattendtheconferencebecauseIhadrecentlylostmycushyjobat
theChicagoMercantileExchangewhereIhadbeenmanagingafloortradingoperation,
workingwithinstitutionalclientsinthefinancialfuturesmarkets.Fortunately,Idecided
toattendtheconference,whichendedupopeningthedoortowholenewcareerinthe
tradingindustry.
I had heard about Fibonacci retracements before, but only as they were applied to
the price axis of the market. I remember the exact area of the room where I sat when
Bobgavehispresentationandillustrated,amongotherthings,averysimpleexampleof
Fibonacciappliedtothetimeaxisofthemarket.Iswearitwasjustliketheproverbial
light bulb went on above my head, and part of me knew that this was the key to my
future.Itwasan“aha”moment.
I was so fascinated by Bob’s presentation, I made my way over to his booth in the
expohallandtoldhimhowmuchIenjoyedhispresentation.Thisledtoshootingacouple
of games of pool over cocktails, and that was the beginning of our friendship that has
lastedovertheyears.
When I started studying Bob’s work, I was so fascinated that I would work on my
paperchartswithapencil,calculator,andproportionaldividereverychanceIgot.Idid
notownacomputeratthetime.Throughthisalmostdailyritualwithmyhandupdated
paper charts, I would prove to myself how powerful were the strategies he taught. I
startedsharingsomeofmyresultswithsomefriendsandclients.Itworkedsowell,some

over the years and perfected my trade strategies. All this eventually led to opening my
ownmarketanalysisandtraderecommendationbusiness,SynchronicityMarketTiming.
WithoutBobMiner,IwouldnotbeenjoyingtheverysuccessfulcareerIhavetoday.
Most of what I’ve learned about technical analysis and trade strategies, I learned from
Bob.Iamforevergratefulforwhathehastaughtmeover theyearsasIcantrulysayI

hisbookisunique.Unlikemosttradingbooks,itwillteachyouacompletetrading
plan from entry to exit. Not a few well-chosen examples of isolated trade setups
and strategies, but exactly how to recognize optimal trade conditions, objective
entry strategies with the exact entry and exit price, and how to manage the trade with
stop-lossadjustmentstothetradeexit.
The majority of trading books focus on a few techniques and show a plethora of
carefully chosen examples to support whatever is being taught. Some of the phrases
often used are “You could have bought around here or taken profit around here”;
“dependingonwhetheryouareaconservativeoraggressivetrader,youcoulddo...(this
orthat)”;“marketsusuallyfluctuatearoundthevolatilityband,whichisagoodplaceto
buyorsell”;andlotsmorenonspecificstatements.
Brokers don’t take orders “around this or that price level.” They only take specific
price orders. There is no such thing as a conservative or aggressive trader. There are
onlytraderswhoeitherfollowatradingplanordon’t.Tomaybedothisorthat“around”
avolatilitybandoranyotherindicatororchartpositionisnotatradestrategy.Atrade
strategy is a specific action to take, including the specific buy and sell price. In other
words, worthwhile instruction will teach you exactly what to do and how and when
todoit.
While many trading books do teach some useful specific trading techniques or at
least provide some ideas to explore, it is very unusual for a book or any other type of
tradingcoursetoteachexactlywhattodo,fromhowtorecognizeatradingopportunity,
to the exact entry and stop price, and how to manage the trade until it is closed out.
Thatiswhatthisbookdoes.Itwillteachyouahighprobabilitytradeplanwithspecific
strategies from entry to exit. Most important, it will teach you how to think about the
fourkeyfactorsofmomentum,pattern,price,andtime;howtorecognizewhatisuseful
andrelevantmarketinformationthatcanbeusedtomakeaspecifictradedecision;and
thenhowtoexecutethetradedecisionsfromentrytoexit.

4 HIGHPROBABILITYTRADINGSTRATEGIESFORANYMARKETANDANYTIMEFRAME
A book is a static medium. It takes a lot of screen captures of charts to illustrate a
trade campaign from entry to exit, no matter what market or time frame is used. Thus,
thisbookhasalotofcharts.I’vetakencarethattheinformationoneachchartshouldbe
quicklyandeasilyunderstood.Mostchartsincludetextcommentspointingoutthemost

assume you are familiar with all the terminology, trade strategies, and book examples.

often conflicting information, making it difficult to focus on the relevant information

tives:multipletimeframemomentum,simplepatternrecognition,pricereversaltargets,

Irarely do live workshops, but when Ido Ipresent aspecial exercise at the end of
the session. I tell the students that I can apply what I have taught them to any symbol,
including stocks, ETFs, futures, or Forex, and it will take three minutes or less to pro-
cessalloftheinformationneededtoidentifywhetherthesymbolisinahighprobability
positionforatradesetuporwhatthatparticularmarketmustdotobecomeahighprob-
ability trade setup. I have the students write any symbol on a piece of note paper. We

everything I have taught them and arrive at a conclusion what is the probable market
positionofthesymbolandthespecifictradestrategies.You,too,willbeabletodothis

If a trader focuses on just the limited, relevant information needed to make a high
probabilitytradedecision,thechanceofsuccessisgreat.
LEADING AND LAGGING INDICATORS

Aleading indicator willprepareyouinadvanceforprobabletradeconditions.Us-
ing my unique approach to dynamic time and price strategies, developed over the past
20 years, you will learn how to identify in advance the probable price and time target

WHAT YOU WILL LEARN IN THIS BOOK AND
VIDEO CD
In this book, you will first learn the four dimensions of market position: multiple time
frame momentum, pattern, price, and time. Each factor provides an important piece of
informationyouwillusetomakeatradingdecision.Atradingplanthatdoesnotinclude
these four market dimensions is missing a big piece of the market puzzle and is much
lesseffectivethanonethatincludesallfourdimensions.

The Multiple Time Frame (MTF) Momentum Strategy is the most

Momentum Strategy is a key factor to the trade plan that identifies

ust about every trading book or course will emphasize that you always want to
“trade with the trend.” It’s great advice. If you are always trading with the trend,
youshouldmountupsomeveryimpressivegains.
Twobigquestionsareusuallynotclearlyanswered:“Howdoyouobjectivelyidentify
trenddirection?”and“Isthetrendintheearlyorlatestages?”
In almost every trading book and course I’ve seen over the past 20 or more years,
the trading educators show many after-the-fact examples of how their trend indicator
identified the trend direction long after the trend was established. It is easy to show
a trend on any chart long after the trend is established. But how do we identify trend
direction in the early stages? How do we identify when an established trend is in the
laterstagesandinapositiontomakeatrendreversal?Withoutsomeapproachtohelp

10 HIGHPROBABILITYTRADINGSTRATEGIESFORANYMARKETANDANYTIMEFRAME
Infact,mostmethodsofidentifyingapricetrendaredoomedtofailureforpractical
trade strategies with as many false reversal signals as confirmed ones. This is a bold
statement, but I believe it is true. It’s time to stop the madness and and deal with the
reality of trend position. I defy any trading educator to provide evidence that his so-
calledtrendindicatorconsistentlyprovidesanaccuratesignaloftrendpositionandtrend
reversalinatimelymannerthatatradercantakeadvantageof.
How can I make this statement? Let’s defy the crowd and think for ourselves in a
logicalmanner.Whatdoesatrendline,channellines,movingaverage,orotherindicator
represent? Every moving average, channel, or indicator is based on historic price data.
Itcanonlyrepresentwhathashappenedorwhatisthecurrentmarketpositionrelative
to the lookback period. It has little predictive value in and of itself. It will always be
a lagging indicator of the trend position, never a leading indicator of what is likely to
happeninthefuture.
Why are some of these techniques promoted over and over again as “trend indica-
tors” with value for making practical trade decisions? Because it is easy to find lots of
chartexamplesthatseemtoillustratehowvaluableareeachoftheauthor’spricetrend

I use the term capital exposure to describe what many trade educators call risk.
Riskistheprobabilityofaneventhappening.Capitalexposureistheamountofmoney
(capital)thatmaybelostifamarketmovesagainstyou.Ihavemuchmoretosayabout
capitalexposurelaterinthebook.
Let’sbeginwiththeconceptsoftrendandmomentumbeforeweevenlookatachart
orthedualtimeframemomentumstrategyrules.
WHAT IS MOMENTUM?
In the world of trading, there are hundreds of momentum indicators (also called oscil-
lators). Most of these indicators use the same information, the open-high-low-close of
a price bar, and represent about the same thing, the rate-of-change of price. There is
nothingmysterious,magical,oruniqueaboutthis.Allpriceindicatorslookbackovera
givenperiod,calledthelookback period,crunchthepricedata,andcomparetherecent
pricepositionwiththepricepositionofthelookbackperiod.Differentindicatorsmanip-
ulate and display the output differently, but all price-based indicators represent about
the same thing: the rate-of-change or how fast the price trend is moving. The indicator
reversals represent the change in momentum—the increase or decrease in the rate-of-
changeofthepricetrend.Thatiswhyyoucanusealmostanypricebasedindicatorfor
theMultipleTimeFrameMomentumStrategyyouwilllearninthischapter.
The first and most basic concept is this: Momentum indicators do not represent
price trends. Momentum indicators represent momentum trends. This should be
obvious,butIcan’ttellyouhowmanynewtradersovertheyearsexpectapricereversal
every time a momentum indicator reverses. It just doesn’t work this way, because the
indicator does not represent the price trend. If it did, this book would be about three
pages long because all we would have to do is reverse our trade position each time a
momentum indicator makes a reversal, and we would compound money faster than
rabbitsonViagracanreproduce.
Unfortunately,itisnotthateasy.Priceandmomentumdonotalwaystrendtogether.
Forexample,amomentumindicatormaymakeabearishreversalanddeclinewhilethe
price trend continues to advance. How can it do this? The rate-of-change of the price
trend is decreasing even though price continues to advance. The bullish trend is just
slowing down, so the momentum indicator is bearish even though the price trend con-
tinuestobebullish.Theoutcome:Thepricetrendandmomentumtrendrunoppositeof
eachother.
Let me repeat this basic and very important concept about momentum indicators:
Momentum indicators represent momentum trends, not price trends. Never expect
price to reverse when the indicator makes a reversal. Often both price and momentum
reversetogether,butsometimestheywilldivergebecausethepricetrendisonlyslowing
down,forcingtheindicatortoreverse.
This point is important to clearly understand, and the vast majority of traders just
don’tgetit.Soletmerepeatitonemoretime:Momentumindicatorsrepresentmomen-
tumtrends,notpricetrends.Priceandmomentummaynottrendinthesamedirection.
Noteverymomentumreversalwillcoincidewithapricereversal.

HOW DUAL TIME FRAME MOMENTUM
STRATEGIES WORK
The concept for Dual Time Frame Momentum Strategy trade setups is simple, practi-
cal,andlogical:Tradeinthedirectionofthelargertimeframemomentum;executethe
tradefollowingthesmallertimeframemomentumreversalsinthedirectionofthelarger
timeframemomentum.Let’stakealookatacoupleofchartsandseehowvaluablethis
strategy will be. We’ll use the SPX daily data for the higher timeframe momentum and
60-minute data for the lower time frame momentum reversals for this example, but it
worksthesameforanymarketandanytwotimeframes.

tumindicator.Thedatesofeachmomentumreversalareshownduringthisperiod.The

and ended in August. For the next several months, the momentum trend was bearish
(period 2), although bonds eventually went higher but ended the period with little net
advance. How can there be a price bull trend witha momentum bear trend? You know
the answer to this. The rate of advance slowed down compared to what it had been.

Waiting forthe smaller timeframedaily momentum bullish reversal before consid-
ering a long trade kept you out of a long trade immediately following the weekly mo-
mentum bullish reversal, when price continued to decline but made a great setup June
10 following the daily momentum bullish reversal. This is an excellent example of why
you must always consider at least two time frames of momentum position before even
considering a trade. Both smaller time frame daily momentum reversals were followed

when the higher time frame weekly momentum was bearish, yet price was sideways
to marginally up by the end of the period. If the higher time frame weekly momentum
is bearish, only short trades would be considered following daily momentum bearish
reversals.
The first daily momentum bearish reversal (point 1 on the daily chart) was made
on a wide range down day which ended up being a swing low. Would this be a losing
trade? I want to stress again, the Dual Time Frame Momentum Strategy setups are not

This approach is applicable to any actively traded market and any time frame,

thebestsettingsorlookbackperiodstouse?Let’saddressbothofthesenow.
WHICH INDICATORS TO USE FOR MULTIPLE TIME
FRAME MOMENTUM STRATEGIES
I’ve made the point several times in this chapter that most price indicators represent
about the same thing, rate-of-change, and will give you about the same results for our
purposes. In the examples so far, I’ve mostly used the DTosc, which is a proprietary
indicatorincludedwithmyDynamicTradersoftware.Let’stakealookatotherindicators
youcanuseandhowtousethem.
Thestochastic(Stoch)indicatorisverypopularandincludedinalltradingsoftware.
TheStochhasoverbought(OB)andoversold(OS)zonesplusafastandslowline,both
characteristicsthatarehelpfulforourpurposes.
Overboughtandoversoldarenotreallygooddescriptivetermsforanindicatorthat
reaches extreme levels, but since these terms are commonly used, we will use them as
well.JustbecauseanindicatorreachedtheOBzoneattheupperextremeoftheindicator
range does not necessarily mean that the market itself is ready to turn down. It only
means the indicator is near the extreme level. It will take some history and looking at
many momentum cycles for the indicator to determine if price is usually at or near a
positiontomakeareversalwhentheindicatorreachestheOBorOSlevels.
An indicator like the Stoch which has a fast and slow line is also helpful. The slow
line of an indicator is usually just a moving average of the fast line. The slow line will
react more slowly to momentum change. When the fast line crosses the slow line, we
callitamomentum reversal.Itwarnsthattherateofmomentumischanging,whichis
oftenprecededorfollowedwithinacoupleofbarsbyadirectionalpricechange.

should be aware of. The larger-degree trend bias will affect how the Stoch indicator
cycles.

differencesinhowtheStochcycledwiththepricecyclesinthischartcomparedtothe

The Stoch hung in the OB zone for much of the trend, only making momentum
declines below the OB line on the larger corrections that lasted several bars. Frequent
momentum oscillations were made in the OB zone without a decline to below the OB
line. This is a similar Stoch momentum pattern to what we saw on the previous chart,
which had much larger corrections during the bullish trend. Even that chart showed a

a strong bull trend with only minor corrections lasting a few days. The MACD made
momentum bullish and bearish reversals within a bar or two of each minor price high
andlow.Itwouldhavebeenveryeffectivetoidentifyentrysignalsduringthelargertime

So which indicator is best to use for the Dual Time Frame Momentum Strategy?
You could just about throw a dart at a list of price indicators and use whichever is hit.
I prefer to use an indicator like the DTosc, which is a combination of stochastic and
RSI,orastochasticitselforotherindicatorthathasoverboughtandoversoldzones.But
the MACD or another indicator that you have used and are familiar with can be just as
useful.

Whymaythesettingschange?Momentumtrendscyclefromlowvolatilityandrela-
tively infrequent momentum reversals to high volatility and relatively frequent momen-
tum reversals. Ideally, we would have a system or indicator that would warn us of the

exists,anymorethanthereisasystemtoprojectinadvancewhenamarketisgoingto
be in a trading range or a consistent trend. So occasionally, we may adjust the settings
foranindicatortoreflectthemostrecentmomentumvolatility.
What is the primary variable for most indicators? It is the lookback period, or the
numberofbars,priortoandincludingthemostrecentbartheindicatorwillusetomake
its calculations. The current value of any indicator is the relationship of the last com-
pletedbartothelookbackperiod.Everyoneisfamiliarwithasimplemovingaverage.It
istheaveragepriceofthepastxnumberofbars,usuallytheclose.Thelookbackperiod
isthenumberofbarsusedtocalculatethemovingaverage.
Alongerlookbackperiodwillbelesssensitivetopricechangethanashorterlook-
back period. It will take a longer period of recent momentum change to influence the
longerlookbackperiodmomentumindicator.Theupsidetothelongerlookbackperiod
is there should be fewer false reversals made by short-term momentum changes. The
downside of the longer lookback period has the potential for a lag between price and
momentum reversals; price may have made a reversal several bars before the momen-
tumindicatormakesthereversal.
Let’s take a look at a few charts and indicators and lookback periods. We’ll begin
by looking at the same data with different indicator lookback periods to see which
may be more useful. Figure 2.18 is daily S&P Index (SPX) data with the DTosc with a
21-day raw lookback period. The DTosc indicator is a combination of Stoch and RSI.
Four numbers show in the indicator window. The first number is the raw lookback pe-
riodwhiletheothernumbersareperiodstherawdataissmoothed.Don’tgethungupon
thedetailsoftheindicator;justgrasptheconceptofhowtheindicatoractsandreactsto
price trends based on the lookback period. How useful would this indicator have been
tosignaloverboughtandoversoldpositionsandpricereversals?
Two things are immediately obvious. While the indicator oscillated nicely with the
price swings, most of the indicator momentum reversals did not reach the OB or OS
zone. For a two-line indicator like the DTosc, stochastic, and others, both the fast and
slowlinemustbeintheOBorOSzonetoconsidertheindicatorOBorOS.Ifanindicator

a relatively shorter lookback period will always result with the indicator making
momentum reversals very close to the price-swing highs and lows. This would seem
to make a short lookback period ideal. However, the more timely signals come with

thehighprobabilitypricetargettocompleteanABCandothercorrections.
While the simple ABC correction is a frequent type of correction, a correction can
takemanyforms.Let’stakealookatcomplexcorrections.
COMPLEX CORRECTIONS
A complex correction is any correction that makes more than three waves or sections.
E-waveacademicshaveidentified13patternsofcomplexcorrections.Wearenotgoing
to examine the many patterns of complex corrections here. In fact, we’re not going to
examineanyparticularcomplexcorrectionpatternsbecauseitserveslittlepurposefor

beingmade.Ifwecandothat,weknowtoorientourtradestrategytotradeagainstthe
directionofthecorrectionforaprobablecontinuationofthetrendtoanewhighorlow
oncethecorrectioniscomplete.
A complex correction typically has several sections that overlap. That’s the
key—overlapping sections. Once we identify that the market should be making a cor-
rective pattern and eventually trend to a new high or low, we can use other strategies
including Dual Time Frame Momentum, price, and time position to help identify if the
correctionisinapositiontobecompleteandcontinuethetrend.

OVERLAP IS THE KEY TO IDENTIFY A
CORRECTION
We don’t need to look at dozens of examples of ABC and complex corrections, since
there is just one guiding principle to identify if a market is in a correction. Once the
sections overlap, it is an early alert signal the market should be making a correction.

I don’t want you to become a so-called Elliott wave expert. I just want you to use
simple logic on what trends and corrections usually look like, what guidelines to use

as the probable outcome, and to think in a logical step-by-step manner as new data is
added.Nocomplexcountingsystems,nodetailedsubdivisionsofsubdivisionsandwaves

targets in advance for support, resistance, and trend reversal, let’s take a quick look at
howwewillusewhatwehavelearnedsofaraboutmomentumandpatternpositionto

MOMENTUM AND PATTERN POSITION
In Chapter 2, you learned how to use dual time frame momentum position as the filter
to identify probable trade setups. How do we use what we have learned so far about
momentum and pattern together to up the odds for a successful trade and lower the
initialcapitalexposure?
Let’s revisit the QQQQ daily chart with Figure 3.29, and include a momentum indi-
cator. The pattern signal that a five-wave trend is complete occurs if the market takes
out the Wave-4 extreme, in this case a low. The Wave-4 extreme may be far from what

ShowingsimpleFibretracementsisusuallyasfarasmosttradingeducatorsgo.But
this chapter is called “Beyond Fib Retracements.” I promised to take you to another
level with price strategies, and that is exactly what I am going to do. Retracement lev-
elsbythemselvesarenotofmuchuseforpracticaltradestrategies.Youcouldgobroke
making trend reversal trades every time a market reached a retracement level. There
has to be more to the price strategy that will help identify which retracement level is
most likely to be the end of a correction. We are not just looking for support or re-
sistance; we want to identify the price level that will complete a correction so we can
either cover a countertrend trade or enter a trade in the direction of the larger time
frametrendattheendofacorrection.Plus,wemustbeabletodiscernifthereisarel-
ativelynarrow-rangeofpricearoundtheretracementlevelthatisatrendreversalprice

I’m not going to show you dozens of examples of highs, lows, and corrective trend
reversals made at the retracements. It is not instructive at this point. For now, all you

Eventhoughexternalretracementsaremorecloselyrelatedtointernalretracements,we
are going to first learn how to make and use alternate price projections to help qualify
which internal retracement is most likely to be the price target for a corrective trend
reversal.

Alternate price projection (APP) is the second method for Dynamic Price Strategies.

The ratios used for alternate price projections for a corrective structure are .618,

(APP), and the ratio used. We are only interested in potential targets above the A high.

With no APP near the 61.8% retracement, more than likely the 61.8% retracement
will not be significant resistance or end the corrective rally. If the JY is making a cor-
rective rally, it is likely to end near either the 50% retracement or the 78.6% retrace-
ment and not near the 61.8% retracement. The 100% APP is the most frequent APP tar-

near117.66to118.14(Zone1),whichincludesthe50%retracementandthe100%APP.If
the JY continued higher beyond this zone, it would likely continue all the way to near
the 78.6% retracement before a corrective high would be made, bypassing the 61.8%

Inthischapter,youwilllearnhowtoprojectinadvanceverynarrow

market condition. The Dynamic Time Strategies you learn will put
you miles ahead of traditional cycle analysis with timing tools for
practicaltradestrategies.
W
henmosttradersthinkofmarkettiming,theythinkoftraditionalcyclestrate-
gies. Traditional cycle strategies project a low or a high based on an average
length of low-low or high-high cycles of past data. This type of cycle analysis
makesassumptionsthatusuallyprovetonotholdupinreality.
Traditional cycles are based on an average cycle length. An average cycle length is
usuallyprettyuselessbecauseitdoesnotconsiderhowtightorwidespreadaretherange
ofnumbersusedthatmaketheaverage.Ifmostofthecyclerepetitionsthatwereused
to come up with the average cycle were tightly grouped, the average would be useful.
Unfortunately, an average can be made of any series of numbers which may be widely
dispersed.Theaveragemaybemeaninglesstopredictthenextrepetition.

will probably be complete by the 62% time retracement unless the correction develops
intoacomplexstructure.
If a market is correcting into a price target and momentum reversal but has not
reached at least the 38% time retracement, more than likely the best to expect is tem-
porary support or resistance. It is not likely to complete a correction. If the correction
reaches price or momentum support and is in the typical time retracement zone for a

Figure 5.4 shows the Time Projection Ratios Using 3 Dates menu. The user may
choose any set of ratios. The time range of the first two data points is measured and
theproportionsaremadefromathirddatapoint.
The three ATPs give us a minimum, probable, and maximum ATP to complete the
third section of a correction. By themselves, they provide useful timing information.
Whenusedwiththetimeretracements,theyprovideevenmoreimportantinformation.
Figure5.5isthesameXAUdailydatawithboththetimeretracementsandalternate
time projections shown on the chart. The first important thing to note is that all three
of the alternate time projections fall within the December 11 to January 2, 38% to 62%

So far, you can see how time retracements and alternate time projections work to-
gether to help identify a time target in the same manner as price retracements and al-
ternatepriceprojections.Theyarebothmadeinthesamewayusingpriceunitsortime

There are several other possible time factors or proportions of prior sections that can
bemade.Themostimportantistherecenthigh-highorlow-lowcycles.Ifprojectingfor
a possible low, the time range of recent lows will help to identify when the next low
is probable. If projecting for a possible high, the time range of recent highs will help

So far, we’ve used one example of a simple ABC correction to illustrate the whole
process. The Dynamic Time Strategy is used for all market conditions, not just simple

if the larger time frame trend analysis suggests a correction is being made, the first as-

despair—the Dynamic Time Strategy will still help provide the time target to complete
thecorrection.
Let’s take a look at a couple of more examples. Figure 5.10 is 15-minute EUR/GBP
data covering less than two days of data. I don’t want to encourage day trading. In the

Before you learn how to complete the Time Band for a more narrow range time
target,afewcommentsarenecessary.First,youhavetousesomejudgmentinchoosing
the high or low pivots. In most cases the relevant pivots are the obvious swing highs
and lows, but also look for periods of market consolidation that fit in with the typical
high-highcountsthathavebeenmade.
Overthepast20years,I’vetestedmanyapproachestoautomaticallyidentifythecy-
clehighsandlows,includingpercentagechangeofpricemovement,factorsofaverage
truerange,Gannswingcharts,momentumcycles,andmore.Nonehasprovedsatisfac-
tory, and each of these approaches has inherent weaknesses that either miss relevant
pivotsorincludeirrelevantpivots.IhavebuiltintotheDynamicTradersoftwareanauto
swing mode which will pick highs and lows either by percentage change in price or by
factors of the average true range. While it saves a lot of time on the first run through
to pick the highs and lows, in almost every case when the auto swing mode is used, I
find I need to edit the swing file because not all the relevant pivots were picked by the
automode.
Beware of any so-called cycle software that allegedly identifies pivots without any
userinput.AsI’vesaidmanytimesbefore,allaspectsoftradingarelikeanyotherbusi-
ness. You can’t buy success. You have to gain knowledge and experience and make
decisions. While identifying the relevant pivots for Time Band targets is 80% or so ob-
jective,withanysetofpivotsyouwillhavetousesomecommonsenseandmakesome
decisionswhichpivotstoinclude.
Another decision you will have to make is whether to eliminate outlier counts. In
mostcases,itisobvious.Ifmostoftheperiodsarewithinarelativelynarrowrangelike
the DJIA in Figure 5.16, and there is one outlier on each end of the range, they can be
eliminated.Iftheperiodsarefairlyevenlyspreadthroughawiderangewithnoobvious

Don’t confuse the swing entry strategy with swing trading. Swing trading has be-
come a buzzword the past few years and doesn’t represent any one particular strategy.

Let’s take a look at a swing entry strategy. Figure 6.11 is 60m S&P mini (ES) fu-
tures contract. The low on the chart is a potential Wave-5 low. To keep the chart un-
cluttered, I am not showing the time and price targets near the low, which suggest
EOW-5 time and price support. The higher time frame daily momentum (not shown)
is bear OS, a position to consider a long trade following a smaller time frame 60m mo-
mentum bullish reversal. A momentum bear OS position implies the downside should
be limited and a bullish reversal is probable following the next lower time frame mo-
mentum bullish reversal. The last bar on the chart is the last 60m bar for November
27 for the pit hours session. Non-pit-hours session data is not considered since the
volume is so low. The 60m ES has made the momentum bullish reversal. The swing
entry for the following day is one tick above the prior swing high. If the entry is ex-
ecuted, the initial protective sell-stop is one tick below the swing low made prior
toentry.

The initial capital exposure would be significant if the trade is executed, so this
particular setup may not be appropriate for a leveraged futures trade for a relatively
small account. It would be a great setup for an unleveraged or margined SPY (S&P
ETF) or S&P index mutual fund position. The beauty of this daily/60m setup is the
trader can use the 60m intraday data to identify the setup and swing entry strategy but
doesn’t have to be watching the market during the day. The buy-stop at 1449.50 to go
long can be put in after regular trading hours. If executed the following day, the pro-
tective sell-stop is automatically entered at 1411.25. Most trading platforms have an “if
this happens, then do this” contingent option. If a buy-stop is executed, a sell-stop is
immediately entered. If the ES does not trade above the swing high the following day
and the buy-stop is not executed, the following evening the trader can see if the con-
ditions are still in place for the swing entry and enter the appropriate buy-stop for the
nextday.

There will come a time when you think you’ve got the market wired. Every technical

acceptable loss. It is absolutely critical to minimize losses and preserve capital. It is
that simple. Assume any trade you place could be a loser, and never risk more than a

The best professional traders rarely have a greater than 50% win record. That’s

knowexactlywhatthecapitalexposureispertradingunitbeforethetradeisexecuted.
Now it is time for you to learn what is the maximum capital exposure (risk) that is
acceptableforanytradeandallopentrades.
I use the term capital exposure to define the dollar amount that may be lost on a
losing trade. Most trading educators call this risk. Risk is the probability of an event
happeningandhasnothingtodowithadollaramount.Riskisnotapropertermforthe
dollarsthatmaybelost.Capitalexposureisamuchbetterterm.However,sinceriskhas

Therearemanycomplicatedmethodstodeterminepositionsizebutthesimplestis
thebest.WhenIfirststartedtradinginthemid-1980s,theteachingsofW.D.Gannwere
my main guide. One of Gann’s rules was to never risk more than 10% of your account
capital on a position. That rule is often repeated. Over the years, I have had many ex-
pensivelessonsthat10%iswaytoomuchtoriskonanyonetrade.Professionaltraders
onlyriskaverysmallamountofcapitalonanyonetradeandasmallmaximumamount
onallopentrades.Three percent maximumcapitalexposureonanyonetradeand6%
maximumexposureonallopentradesistheacceptedstandard,anditisagoodone.
The maximum exposure should be a percentage of the account equity available. If
your available equity is $20,000, the maximum capital exposure on a trade should be
$600($20,000×3percent).Themaximumcapitalexposureonallopentradesshouldbe
$1,200($20,000×6percent).It’sthatsimple.Ifyougoovertheselimits,youarestacking
theoddsofsuccessagainstyouandyouarenotconductingyourbusinessoftradingina

Mosttradersalsohaveamaximumlossthatisacceptableforanyonemonth.Ifthat
maximum is reached, they stop trading for the month. A maximum monthly loss must
be no more than 10 percent. If closed trades have resulted in a 10% drawdown to the
account in less than a month, stop trading for the balance of the month. Either you or

success. All successful traders limit the potential loss on any one trade to a relatively

U
p to this point, you’ve learned how to identify the optimal conditions for a trade
setup and the objective entry strategies, including the exact entry price and ini-
tial protective stop-loss price. Identifying good entry setups is only one part of
a complete trading plan. But you can’t make a single dollar with the best entry strate-
gies. You only make money on a closed trade. There can be an enormous difference
in your net success depending on how well you manage the trade and your ability to
consistently stay with a trend until the market conditions suggest the trend is at its
conclusion.

MULTIPLE-UNIT TRADING
Multiple-unit trading should increase your trading success significantly. It made a big
difference when I incorporated it into my trade plan years ago. It’s nothing new. Suc-
cessful traders have been using multiple-unit trade strategies as long as there has been
trading.

RISK/REWARD RATIOS
Sometradingeducatorsmakeabigdealaboutso-calledrisk/rewardratiosandmayeven
base trading decisions on them. What do we mean by a risk/reward ratio and why is
it basically a bogus idea? Risk/reward is supposed to compare the initial capital expo-
sure (risk) to the potential reward (profit) as a ratio. Traders are often taught to only
take a trade with a 3:1 risk/reward ratio. Right off the bat, we’ve got some confusing
information.A3:1risk/rewardratiowouldmeanthereisthreetimestherisktothepo-
tentialreward.Whattheyreallymeanisareward/riskratioof3:1.Okay,I’mbeingpicky.
But being picky and precise with how we think about and express ideas is critical to
success.
I’llusethewordriskforthisdiscussiontomeanthemoreappropriateterm,initial
capital exposure. The dollar amount of risk for any trade can be defined in advance. If
theentrypriceis$40andtheinitialprotectivesell-stopis$35,weknowtheriskis$5if
stoppedout(baringagapthroughthestopprice).Theriskforanytradeisafunctionof
theentrypricelessthestoppriceandisknownbeforeatradeistaken.
But what about the reward? How do we determine what is the probable reward
for any potential trade? We guess. That’s right. The reward part of the equation is just
a best guess of the minimum price objective we believe the market will make for the
trade we are considering. The potential reward is never known. I’ve seen all kinds of
ways put forth to calculate the potential reward, some logical and useful, some noth-
ing but the trader’s or educator’s excuse to come up with a number. The potential re-
ward can be based on any of a number of factors. Market structure such as typical
E-wave price targets, prior support or resistance, the probability of a market exceed-
ing a swing high or low, and price percentage change are just a few reward targets
taught.

logical reward target. Whether a market is in a trend or countertrend, the next section
will often reach the 100% alternate price projection. Not always, but we assume that

In every case, the reward is a best guess. Usually, it is an optimistic guess by the
tradertojustifythetrade.Somemarketeducatorsmaketheso-calledrisk/rewardratio
akeytradingstrategyandneverconsideratradeunlesstheratioisaminimumsuchas

EXIT STRATEGIES
Once again, concepts are important. Start with a logical concept and devise a strategy
based on the concept. There are four important concepts for exit strategies. The first:
Always let the market take you out by moving against the position. Do not exit at a
predeterminedpricetarget.Amarketwilloftenblowrightthroughapricetarget,some-
timesbyasubstantialamount.Ifyouexitatthepricetarget,youmaymissmaximizing
the profit potential of a trade if the trend continues beyond expectations. Price targets

Iguessyoushouldneversay“never.”Onesituationwhereyoumightuseaspecific
priceobjectivetoexitwouldbeifyouwereabouttoleaveforvacationandwouldnotbe
able to update your data each night to assess the current position and make decisions.
In that case, you will have two open orders in the market: the protective stop and the
take-profits,exit-priceorder
Thesecondimportantexitstrategyconceptisthattheexitstrategyshouldbebased
onthesamemarketconditionsthatdeterminedtheconditionstoidentifythetradeentry
in the first place. If the dual time frame momentum position was a key factor to enter
a trade in the direction of the larger time frame trend, a dual time frame momentum
position should be a key factor in the exit strategy. The factors of momentum, pattern,
price,andtimethatarekeystoidentifyatradeentryarethesamefactorsusedtoidentify
theexitstrategy.
The third important concept is to determine the general exit strategy and trade
management of both units before the trade is entered. That doesn’t mean pick a target
priceandexitthetradeifthetargetpriceisreached.Itdoesmeantoidentifythetrade
objective and what conditions will require a stop-loss adjustment and exit strategy for
each unit, before the trade is entered. Specific actions are taken if the conditions are
manifested.
Fourth and very important, the trade management and exit strategy may change
as the market provides more information. As each new bar is made, whether a
weekly or intraday time frame, new information is available. As the market struc-
ture (pattern) develops, it may provide important clues to the position of the trend
and where a stop should be adjusted. Price targets will often be adjusted depend-
ing on the pivot highs and lows made as a trend develops. Changes will probably be
made to the trade management plan for any specific trade as the market provides new
information.
I wish there was one fixed rule-based exit strategy that could be used with all
markets, all conditions, and all time frames. There isn’t, if you want to maximize the
potentialreturnforanyposition.Itiseasytomakeupacompletelyobjectiverulebased
on price or momentum and call it an exit strategy. But no rule-based exit strategy will
maximizethepotentialrewardforatrade.AsI’vestatedoverandoveragainthroughout
this book, trading is a business like every other business. You have to gain knowledge
and experience and constantly make decisions. You can never eliminate the decision-
makingprocessbyrules,systemsoranysoftwareifyouwanttosucceedinthebusiness,
any more than you can eliminate the decision-making process from any other business

retracement area of the May 2005 to May 2006 bull trend for the fourth time. Based
on the weekly cycles of the past 18 months or so, the Time Band for a weekly low is

TheexpectationistheXAUshouldeventuallybreakupfromtheprolongedtrading

The Trade Plan
My trading plan for this set up was to trade two units. I would enter the trade with the
one bar high strategy (60m trailing 1BH) following the next (60m) 34 hourly DTosc
(momentum) bullish reversal. In case I am wrong, I would trail my first unit with one-

What I Have Learned
Although I could have gained more from the second unit, I followed my trading plan
which I have learned from Dynamic Trading Workshop. I am very successful with this
approach and the most important thing I have learned so far is to do your homework,
makeallpriceandtimeprojections,andwait.IwaitedforthistradetothepointwhereI
hadalltheconditionsinplace.Ithinkthisiswhythistradewassoprofitable.
Trading is not an easy business. You must work hard and wait for the best oppor-
tunity. I discovered that patience and hard work is the key to success. Patience is also
necessary for proper money management and not to overtrade so in case of multiple
lossesinarow,youcanbetherefortomorrow.

Jagirhadtradedforlessthanayearwhenhesentmetheseexamples.Hehadflown
fromtheUnitedKingdomtoattendaliveone-dayworkshopIofferedinDenverinFebru-
ary 2007. He was a new trader at the time and had had some trading instruction in the
United Kingdom but didn’t start trading on a regular basis until the spring of 2007, fol-
lowingtheworkshopinDenver.
Ithinkanimportantreasonforhissuccessisthathewasnewtotradinganddidn’t
have a lot of bad habits and ego to overcome when he began trading. He was the ideal
student. He treated trading as a business right from the start. As you will see from the
twoexamplesIincludehere,hefollowedthehighprobabilitytradingplantaughtinthis
booktoaTandhasfoundgreatsuccess.
Jagirdidnotsendanytextcommentarywithhisexamples.Allofthecommentsand
keyinformationwererightonthecharts,whichmakesiteasyforhimtokeeparecord
of his trades. I’ve recaptured the relevant charts with comments and written the text
commentary to describe the trade as he described it in his brief chart notes. He gave a
few examples with large profits, but I’ve chosen to show a couple of trades with fairly
small profits where a less experienced trader may have had losses, given the market
reversals made during the trades. Jagir made at least small profits on these trades by
applyinggoodtradingstrategiesandgoodtrademanagement.
GBP/USD Short Trade Setup
Weeklyanddailymomentumoverbought
PossibleABCcorrectivehigh
As of September 24, 2007, the British pound (GBP) weekly momentum had turned
bearishandthedailymomentumwasoverbought.TheGBPhadpokedabovethe78.6%
retracementforapossibleABCcorrectivehigh.TheTimeBandforahighwasSeptember
26toOctober1,butthehigh-high bandbegan onSeptember 21.Thehigher timeframe
weekly and daily positions were ideal for a possible ABC high and a short trade setup.
(SeeFigure8.5.)
Trade Execution The60mchartshowsthepossibleABCcountintotheSeptember
24 high. Jagir showed that the Wave-C had probably subdivided into five waves. Jagir’s
chartshowedseveralpricetargetsclusteredaroundtheSeptember24high,includinga
78.6% retracement, 100% APP of Wave-A, 162% Ext-Ret of Wave-C, and more. I’ve only
shown the 162% Ext Ret on the 60m chart to keep the chart from being cluttered. (See
Figure8.6.)
Trade Management Once the 60m DTosc made a bearish reversal, Jagir trailed a
stop to go short two units at the 60m trailing 1BL. The short position was executed at
2.0254 and the initial protective buy-stop was one tick above the September 24 high at
2.0322. The objective to cover half of the position (one unit) was at the minor 50% re-
tracementat2.0200.

Trade Execution The 60m chart shows the data following the September 18 possi-
ble Wave-C high that was shown on the daily chart. The JPY declined and made a pos-
sible minor ABC advance into the September 21 high. The high was right in the zone
of the 78.6% retracement and 100% APP. The 60m DTosc made a bearish reversal for
an ideal short setup. (See Figure 8.10.) Jagir trailed a go-short stop one pip below the
60m trailing 1BL. A two-unit short position was taken at 115.33, not far from the minor
W.chigh.

I first met Derrik around 2002 when I lived in Tucson, Arizona, and he was visiting our
mutual friend, Larry Pesavento. Derrik had been a longtime Dynamic Trader software
owner and subscriber to the DT Reports. Derrik later published his own trading book,
FibonaccifortheActiveTrader(TradingMarketsPublishingGroup,2004).
Derrik trades for his own account and advises on risk management and hedging
strategiesforfarmers.I’vere-createdthechartshesenttome.Thetradedescriptionand
commentary are all his except my comments in parenthesis italics and in the “Robert’s
Comments”and“Robert’sFollow-Up”sections.

Trade Entry
Inspeakingwithmyfarmers,IcommunicatedthatIwouldnotbesellingattheselevels,
but that I would be looking for an opportunity to buy and, in a farmer’s case, simply
hold off on any kind of hedging decisions. To confirm my analysis, I was looking for
a DT Oscillator momentum bullish reversal. Once this occurred, I would go long even
thoughmyproducerswerenervouslyholdingontosoybeansintheirbins,prayingthat
myanalysiswouldbeaccurate.
OnApril20IgotmyentrysignalwiththeDTOscillatorbullishreversal,onlytofind
the market push down deeper into my Fibonacci support zone. (Derrik went long at
767’25onApril20withaninitialprotectivesell-stopat743’75,whichwasabitbelow
the regression support channel line and several minor price projections he had made

Carolyn calls this a two-step pattern setup. The resistance area included three minor
100%APPs,the127%Ext-RetoftheWave-B,the50%retracementfromtheMarch7high,
and the 78.6% retracement from the March 10 early morning high. Carolyn calls these
symmetry setups when several 100% alternate price projections make a very narrow-
rangezone.
Carolyn generally uses two types of entry triggers. One is a decline below a minor
swing low, or atrailingone-bar-low, as you’ve learned in thisbook. Another istoenter

minimum conditions to consider a trade. You have learned specific, objective entry
strategies once the minimum conditions to consider a trade have been met. You have
learned how to identify time, price, pattern, and momentum conditions to adjust stops
tomanagethetradethroughtheexit.Asatradeprogresses,youwillhavetomakedeci-
sions,butthedecisionsshouldbemadeinthecontextofthemarketposition,notsome
arbitrary fear or greed factor that is not related to the original reasons the trade was
made.
Somereaderswillbeasking,“Whydon’tyoujustgiveusatradeplan?”Therearea
couple of reasons. First, you probably wouldn’t follow it. You would second-guess the
objectiverulesandmakeunwarrantedassumptionswhendecisionsneededtobemade.
It is very difficult to follow someone else’s plan. A few years ago, I trained for and
participatedinseveraladventureracesoveratwo-yearperiod.Theadventureraceswere
mostly nonstop 24 hours and included mountain biking, trail hiking/running, kayaking,
rappelling, and land navigation. They were brutal. I read several books on endurance
training and understood the key training principles. I hired an endurance trainer over
several months to make a training plan for each day to work on developing my biking
andrunningendurance.EachweekendIreceivedane-mailwiththenextweek’straining
plan.DidIfollowtheplanexactlyeveryday?No.Theplanwasagoodguidelineofwhat
to work on, but many days I varied the plan to suit my current condition. The training
plan kept me focused. I worked within the principles of the plan but some days made
variations depending on how I felt that day. The trainer’s plan was a key to improving
my performance, but I think I progressed more or at least kept more motivated and in-
terestedinthetrainingbymakingsomechanges.Inotherwords,Iusedthetrainersplan
asaguidetodevelopmyownplan.Itisverydifficulttofollowanotherperson’splan.
Second, you may want to begin with a more rigid and objective plan than a plan I
would suggest. A more objective plan may result in fewer setups that meet your more
objective rules and guidelines but may also result in a higher rate of successful trades.
This is usually the trade-off with more rules: Fewer trades are entered, but often the
fewernumberoftradeshaveahigherrateofsuccess.Asyougainmoreexperience,you
maybroadentherulesandguidelinestoallowyoutoapplyyouraddedknowledgetothe
decision-makingprocess.
Prior chapters have given you all the information you need to develop a trade plan
andmakedecisionswhennecessary.Let’sreviewthemajorelementsofeverytradeplan
toguideyoutomakingyourownspecificplan.

3. Objective entry strategy. I have a very firm belief that once the conditions for a

there are no more decisions to be made as to how and at what price to execute

What time frame has the best potential for trading profits? Which markets are the best

The trend in the past 10 years or so is for shorter-term trading, particularly day-
tradingwithhighleverage.Notmanyyearsagothetradingtimeframeformosttraders,
including highly leveraged futures traders, was from a few days to a few weeks or
months. Today we would call that swing or position trading. Until at least the early
1990s,real-timedatawasveryexpensive,commissionswererelativelyhigh,computers

closer to 90 percent-plus) of traders lose most or all of their trading capital within

alternate price projection (APP) Compares the price range of swings in the same direc-
tion. The most frequently used percentage alternate price projections are 62 percent,
100 percent, and 162 percent. Sometimes called price extensions by other authors and
in some software programs. The principle is that the price range of a section is of-
ten one of the key APP ratios of recent sections. An APP is made from three pivot
points. The price range between two pivots is measured and projected from a third
pivot.
alternate time projection (ATP) Compares the time range of swings in the same direc-
tion. The most frequently used percentage alternate time projections are 62 percent,
100 percent, and 162 percent. The principle is that the time range of a section is of-

bear OS, momentum When an indicator is bearish and has reached the oversold (OS)

have reached the oversold zone. In most cases, bear OS momentum warns that
the downside should be limited before a momentum low and probable price low is
made.

Multiple Time Frame Momentum Strategy A strategy to place trades only when at least
two time frames of momentum are in the same direction, such as weekly and daily, or
daily and 60-minute. The basic strategy is to trade in the direction of the larger time
frame and execute the trade following a smaller time frame momentum reversal in the
direction of the larger time frame momentum. Can use more than two time frames of
momentum. (See Dual Time Frame Momentum Strategy Rules in text for bull OB and
bearOSexceptions.)
momentum indicator Most price-based indicators are also called momentum indicators.
Inmostcases,themomentumindicatorrepresentstherate-of-changeoverthelookback
