PREFACE

his book shows you how to build a tradeable strategy. A tradeable strat-
egy is one that fits your own risk/reward goals, and one that trades in
real‐time as well as it performs in the development back‐test. It is not easy
to develop a tradeable strategy because there are serious pitfalls. Most of us
are greedy and want to trade something that has a large return. We ratio-
nalize that we can accept a lot of risk in the form of draw‐down to achieve
vii
the large return, but in reality few traders can trade through a 20 percent
draw‐down before abandoning the strategy. To help you form realistic risk/
reward goals, the first chapter shows the real‐time performance of the best
traders in the world over a recent five‐year period. Based on that chapter, I
urge you to write down the system characteristics that would be tradeable
for you. Address risk first in the form of max draw‐down, average annual
max draw‐down, and longest time between equity highs. So the first pitfall
is greed. It manifests itself in every strategy development step. You will be
inclined to accept a system rule that increases profitability, even though it
increases risk at a higher rate. But an even greater pitfall is the danger of
curve‐fitting.
Curve‐fitting occurs when you develop a strategy with too few trades in
the development sample. Curve‐fit systems impact the second characteristic
of a tradeable system: Curve‐fit systems don’t trade in real‐time as well as
they back‐test. It is unfortunate that the system development packages you
can buy are almost universally tied to the one‐chart paradigm; you place
many bars of data from a single tradeable on a chart and develop a strategy
to trade that instrument. Even if your developed strategy yields hundreds of

viii
ECAFERP
trades, it probably isn’t enough to be anything other than heavily curve‐fit.
Chapter 2 covers curve‐fitting extensively and shows how you can generate
enough trades to minimize curve‐fitting. It uses examples and statistics, and
details an easy‐to‐perform process that you can use to determine the degree
of curve‐fitting in your development work. Most strategies fail or under‐
perform because they are overly curve‐fit. If you want to succeed, you need
to fully understand how to minimize curve‐fitting.
Most of the remainder of the book is spent developing two tradeable
systems: one a short‐term scalping system for stocks, and the other a
mid‐term trend‐following strategy for commodities. As these systems
are developed, entries, exits, and trading filters are detailed. By the end
of the development process, both are “tradeable” as is, but how to tai-
lor them to a range of risk/reward profiles is covered in, five chapters
on money management. I make a differentiation between small-account
traders and large-account traders. Small-account traders are always a
handful of adverse trades away from a margin call. They cannot take
advantage of sizing techniques that optimize equity growth because the
risk of more than a one‐lot might be 10 or even 20 percent of their ac-
count size. Using small‐account trading techniques, money management
rules for both the stock and commodity systems are detailed in two
chapters. Similarly, the systems are adapted for the large‐account trader
in two chapters. Lastly, both systems are combined. Table P.1 illustrates
the range of tradeable solutions available.

There is material in the book that I’ve never seen elsewhere. Most nota-
bly, bar‐scoring is detailed in Chapter 8. It is an exciting new way to charac-
terize the profit potential of each bar with user‐defined criteria.

Lastly, Chapter 9 and Chapter 10 are devoted to an analysis of some of the
trading claims commonly made in the literature, and to trading maxims that
may or may not have a basis.

CHAPTER 1
What Is a
Tradeable
Strategy?
T
he purpose of this book is to show the reader how to develop a trade-
1
able strategy. But before the how-to part, you need to realistically un-
derstand what a tradeable strategy must encompass. I say realistically be-
cause some traders envision a tradeable strategy as one that never loses a
trade, never has a losing day, and at least doubles your money each year.
It’s nice to have lofty goals, but you’ll never find a strategy that meets those
criteria. To show the art of the possible, the first part of this chapter will
present documented performance from some of the best traders over the
last five years. Then we’ll look at metrics that best characterize a trading
strategy’s performance. Lastly, a set of questions will be presented to help
you define what would constitute a tradeable strategy according to your
risk‐taking tolerance.

Table 1.1 raises a number of interesting points:
Across all 20 funds, the average annual yearly performance of 27.98 percent
■
is only about 3.5 percent higher than the average of the max draw‐downs.
Out of the 20 funds, 17 had an entire one‐year period without any gain.
■
The best 12‐month period heavily skewed the average five‐year return per-
■
formance numbers. If you compound a starting amount by 27.98 percent
per year (the average annual return across the 20 entities) for five years,

the ending equity is about 243 percent higher than the starting amount.
The average best 12‐month average return of 125.3 percent is over half
that amount.
I n general, the funds with the higher fi ve‐year return took more risk, as re-
■
fl ected by the draw‐down numbers. This can be seen by plotting the average
return and max draw‐down points on a graph and fi tting a regression line to
the return and draw‐down points. Figure 1.1 shows the graph.

These performance numbers probably introduce a reality shock into
those looking to develop their own tradeable strategy. Real trading involves
these tenets:
You are not going to make 100 percent each year. The number-one CTA
■
in the list averaged 44.54 percent for 5 years, but even then it had a
12‐month period that netted only 1 percent.
If you shoot for a relatively high return, you will have a relatively high
■
draw‐down at some point. If you shoot for a relatively lower return, you
should be able to see relatively less draw‐down.
If you are fortunate enough to have a period of exceptional returns,
■
remember that those gains may have to carry your performance for
years.
You will go extended periods of time without any gains.

■ Metrics to Use in Gauging Tradeable
System Performance
Based on the performance of some of the best money managers in the world,
there are a minimum of three areas that need to be addressed in defining a
suitable tradeable system:
1. Some measure of normal return and normal draw‐down. These are
the risk/reward benchmarks you’ll be experiencing most of the
time.
2. The worst‐case risk benchmark. This is the worst draw‐down you’ll
have to trade through over an extended period of time—maybe the
worst case in the last 5 or 10 years.
3. The longest flat time. This is the longest time you’ll go before hitting a
new equity high.
Looking at worst‐case risk first, we’ve seen that the best managers in the
world normally average just a little more than their five‐year biggest draw‐
down. A goal of a tradeable system is one that averages more per year than
its largest draw‐down. This book will show that, in general, return can be
increased or decreased through leverage. As you increase or decrease the re-
turn, your draw‐down will also go up or down. It makes sense then to define
the max draw‐down you are willing to accept and use leverage to bring the
system performance down to a point where the max draw‐down is less than
your acceptable threshold.
It’s my experience that it’s hard to design a system with minimal “flat
time” as a design metric. You do the best you can through the development
process and when you’ve got something that meets your risk‐reward goals,
you see what the other metrics look like. If flat time, or some other charac-
teristic, is way over what you’re willing to trade through, the best way to fix
the problem is to introduce another type of strategy that is lowly correlated
to the one with the issue.
■ Know Yourself
It’s easy to start the design process and say, “I want something that has a max
draw‐down of 20 percent, and for that risk I’ll accept an average return of
25 percent.” The problem starts when you’ve developed such a strategy and

5

STRATEGY?
start to trade. Suppose you go three months and are down 10 percent. I
don’t care who you are, you’ll start to have doubts:
Is the strategy curve‐fit in some way?
■
Has the market changed?
■
Volatility seems too high (too low). Is that the problem?
■
If you’ve set your max draw‐down too high, by the time you recover, or
get to 20 percent, you’ll be a wreck. This is where it becomes important to
know yourself. If you’re new to trading and never experienced a 20‐percent
draw‐down, shoot for less—probably much less. I’ve talked to thousands of
traders, and most say, “I can weather a 20 percent draw‐down if the return is
X percent,” but in reality few can go that far. Don’t look at draw‐down as a
function of return. You’ve got to get through the draw‐downs to realize the
return, so set your max draw‐down at a level you know you can trade through.
■ Conclusion
The best money managers in the world average less than 30 percent a year, and
experience a max draw‐down every five years that is only a few percent less than
their average return. Unfortunately, statistics on average annual max draw‐down
aren’t easy to find, but that is an important number because that’s what you need
to trade through every year to achieve your return. Our goals then for develop-
ing a tradeable system must include these two performance objectives:
1. Average annual return is greater than max draw‐down over at least a
five‐year period.
2. Average annual return needs to be a multiple of the average annual max
draw‐down.
The third required performance objective is defined by the trader: What
is the max draw‐down you will tolerate? Pick a realistic number.
This book will show you how to develop strategies that meet these
objectives. In fact, when we’re done, there will be fully defined stock
and commodity strategies that you can trade as-is if you wish. Before we
develop these systems, there’s really another part to tradeability and that
is, your strategy must trade in real time like it does on your developmen-
tal data. The next chapter will discuss how to develop your strategy so it
trades like it back‐tests.

eveloping a tradeable strategy involves two steps. The first is to define
the risk/reward balance the trader can live with, and the second is to
develop a strategy that meets those guidelines and trades in real time like it
back‐tests. Most of the rest of this book will address how to develop strate-
gies that meet your trading objectives. This chapter addresses something much
more important: the pitfalls a developer will run into in developing a strategy
that will trade like it backtests. There are many “how to develop” ways; this
book only shows mine, but there is only one way to make sure your developed
strategy trades in real time like it backtests. That one way involves minimizing
curve‐fitting in your development and making trading assumptions in your
development that work as realistically as possible. Far and away, the biggest
pitfall is curve‐fitting. This chapter uses statistics to help clarify the concept,
but don’t skip over it because of the math. These are important concepts, and
if you don’t understand them you will continually develop systems that fail in
real‐time trading and you will never understand why.

■ Curve-Fitting
When you’re developing a trading strategy, you test trading ideas against
historical data to see if the idea is profitable. If you had an infinite amount
of historical data, you could be sure that an idea that proves profitable on
the historical data would be just as profitable in the future. But we never
have an infinite amount of data; we only have a few decades worth of data in
the best case. With that small subset of the “infinite data pool,” we can’t be
sure a backtested profitable idea will continue to be profitable in the future.
This development problem is often exacerbated by a practice called curve‐
fitting. Curve‐fitting can be defined in the following way: either the overuse
of trading rules, parameters, filters, stops, and so forth when developing a
trading strategy on a relatively large body of data, or the proper use of rules,
filters, and so on on a relatively small body of data.
A curve‐fitting example will be given for each of these cases. For the case
where a relatively large body of data was used, here’s a true story. I knew
a trader in the late ’90s that developed an S&P 500 futures trading system
using 45‐minute bars. He had S&P 45‐minute bar data spanning the 1984–
1998 time frame. During most of that time, the S&P 500 futures opened at
9:30 EST and closed at 16:15 EST, so there were nine 45‐minute bars each
day for the 15 years. That’s a total of about 34,000 bars of historical data.
With all that data, he developed a trading system that made less than 90
trades in the 15 years. That’s a trade every other month. But those 90 trades
were spectacular. There were only a few losers, and the average trade was
over $2,000. He figured he could double a starting amount of $10,000 each
year with the strategy. I saw him a few years later and asked how his system
was working out. He scratched his head and said he couldn’t figure out what
went wrong. The system “stopped working” as soon as he started trading
it. I believe that what really happened is that he used so many rules, filters,
and so forth on the relatively large amount of data that he isolated 90 short
periods of time that were highly profitable.
Curve‐Fitting Using Good Development
Practices on a Small Amount of Data
Curve‐fitting on a relatively small body of data can be illustrated by looking
at the Swiss franc during the 1980s. That time‐frame was picked because
the Swiss franc trended beautifully in the 1980s. Let’s use a moving average
to determine the trend. If today’s n‐day average is higher than yesterday’s,

the trend is up so you buy one contract. You hold that position until today’s
n‐day average is less than yesterday’s. When that happens, you exit your long
position and go short. It’s called a reversal system. You always have a posi-
tion and that position alternates from long to short to long. The breakout in
Table 2.1 shows the results when the n‐day average is varied from 10 days to
100 days in 10‐day increments.

This table illustrates how well the Swiss franc trended in the 80s. There is
substantial profit at each moving average point. Let’s select the 50‐day mov-
ing average point and try to improve results by adding an n‐day look‐back
filter. One of the tenets of trend trading is to only trade in the direction
of the long‐term trend. An n‐day look‐back filter is a way to do that. You
look back n days and if the close today is higher than that close, the trend
is up and you only take long trades. In looking back n‐days, if today’s close
is less than the n‐day look‐back close, you only take short trades. When we
add that logic to our 50‐day reversal system, the results in Table 2.2 are for
look‐backs ranging from 60 days to 150 days.
Let’s select the 110‐day look‐back filter as a good addition to the system,
and now look to add some risk control. Let’s use a “catastrophic stop loss”
to get us out of trades that move “too far” into loss. When we enter a long
or short position, the catastrophic stop is placed X dollars away from the
entry. If that stop is hit, we don’t reenter in the same direction until an
entry in the other direction is signaled. There are two ways to implement
this stop. First you can enter the stop as a “good until canceled” stop loss.

In that case, the stop is always in the market (just when the market’s open;
nothing trades 24/7). The second way is to not place the stop into the mar-
ket, but instead wait until there is a close adverse to the stop and exit at the
next open. In that case you can have losses well in excess of your stop loss,
but there are two benefits. One benefit is that the stop is not active during
periods of illiquidity; almost every commodity has bid/ask spreads that
increase overnight, sometimes dramatically, and with an active stop there’s
a chance of a horrendous fill. The other benefit is that many times an active
stop would be hit during the day, but the market reverses from that point
to close inside the stop. In that case your trade is still alive to turn profit-
able. The second stop method is used to generate the results in Table 2.3.

It shows the results when we vary the stop loss from $250 to $2,000 in
$250 increments.
Obviously, the best stop value to use is $750.
The following points can be made about this system:
If the draw‐downs are reasonable, this would be an excellent system to
■
trade. The average return per year is about $8,500 and the margin re-
quired was generally about $3,000 per contract. I would be very happy
to trade a system that netted these results.
This system is pure and simple: one entry rule, one filter, and one piece
■
of risk control logic. I doubt anyone would claim it’s got too many vari-
ables or that it’s over‐optimized.
A $750 stop is relatively small, so even if you’re stopped out two or three
■
times in a row, it’s not a huge dent to your account.
The fact that there are more losing trades than winners doesn’t concern
■
me. Most longer‐term trend‐following systems only average between 30
and 45 percent winning trades.
The profit‐per‐trade of $1,326 is very comforting because slippage and
■
commission won’t be a significant percent of profit.
You know this is supposed to be an example of curve‐fitting, so what hap-
pened? Table 2.4 shows the results of trading this system on the Swiss franc
from 1990 through 2010.

The system that averaged $8,500 per year in the 1980s averaged only
about $1,500 a year in the following 21 years. The system was obviously
tuned up for the 10 years of great trend‐following performance by the Swiss
franc in the 1980s. In the years that followed, the franc was less “trendy.” We
curve‐fit to a relatively small amount of data, even though we didn’t weigh
the system down with a lot of rules, filters, and so on.

Curve‐Fitting Is Proportional to the Number of
Trades in the Development Sample
If you compare the two curve‐fi tting examples, there’s one similarity: They
both had a relatively small number of trades in the development sample.
Let’s postulate that curve‐fi tting is proportional to the number of trades
in the development sample. We know that if we had an infi nite number of
trades, we’d have the entire universe of trades and there could be no curve‐
fi tting. The question is: How many trades are “close enough” to represent
the infi nite sample? An experiment we can use to get an insight into that
question is to take a commodity and generate a large number of trades,
then sample from the large number and see how many trades need to be in
the smaller sample to generate a small diff erence from the “infi nite” sample
statistics. If the hypothesis is correct, we should see the diff erence in results
between the “infi nite” sample and our smaller sample sizes get smaller and
smaller as the number of trades in the sample size increases. Figure 2.1
shows the thought.

The only issue with that methodology is generating “diff erence in results.”
Fortunately statisticians have solved this problem for us. Their methodology
is called standard error. You compute the mean value of the infi nite sample
(the average profi t‐per‐trade), and then randomly pick n‐trade samples a
number of times. If you compute the average of each of these samples, and

then compute the standard deviation of the averages, you have the standard
error. Hopefully, an example will clarify things.
Suppose you have an infi nite number of trades generated by a strategy,
and that the average profi t-per-trade across the infi nite sample was $100.
You decide to randomly pull a number of 10‐trade samples and see how
closely the results match the infi nite distribution. Figure 2.2 represents the
results of randomly selecting fi ve 10‐trade samples.

FIGURE 2.2 Randomly Picking Five 10‐Trade Samples from the Infi nite Distribution
of Trades
T he average profi t‐per‐trade for each sample is:
Sample 1 mean: 97.94
Sample 2 mean: 104.6
Sample 3 mean: 100.17
Sample 4 mean: 101.43
Sample 5 mean: 98.89
The standard deviation across those fi ve average profi t‐per‐trade values
is 2.59; that’s also the standard error. Now for what it means. One standard
deviation above and below the infi nite sample mean of 100 will statistically
include 68.3 percent of the sample means. So 0.683 multiplied by 5 sample
means is a value of 4.098 cases. That number of the sample means should be
inside the 97.41 to 102.59 range (mean of 100 minus 1 standard deviation
of 2.59 equals 97.41, and mean of 100 plus 2.59 equals 102.59). In our

case, four of the sample means were inside the range, and one (104.6) was
outside. If we extended this case to draw hundreds of 10‐trade samples:
68.3 percent of the sample means would fall in the range of 100 minus 1
■
standard deviation to 100 plus 1 standard deviation.
95.4 percent of the sample means would fall in the range of 100 minus 2
■
standard deviations to 100 plus 2 standard deviations.
99.7 percent of the sample means would fall in the range of 100 minus 3
■
standard deviations to 100 plus 3 standard deviations.
As a trader, this means that if you developed a strategy that had an aver-
age profit‐per‐trade of $100 and a standard error of $2.59, you could be
68.3 percent confident that the true profit‐per-trade of the strategy was
between $97.41 and $102.59. And you could be 99.7 percent confident that
the true profit-per-trade was between $92.23 and $107.77. (My statistics
professor would kill me for stating it that way, but dropping all the statistics
caveats, that’s basically what it means.)
That’s how standard error works, but in the real world, you don’t get
hundreds of n‐trade samples. You only get one sample, and that’s your back‐
test results. What do you do then? Well, there’s a way to get an estimate of
the standard error of the mean using just that one sample. Compute the
standard deviation of the trades in your back‐test and divide by the square
root of the sample size. Here are the results for our five samples of 10 trades:
Sample 1: mean = 97.94, standard deviation = 10.26, standard error
= (10.26/√10) = 3.25
Sample 2: mean = 104.6, standard deviation = 9.28, standard error
= 2.94
Sample 3: mean = 100.17, standard deviation = 11.19, standard error
= 3.54
Sample 4: mean = 101.43, standard deviation = 11.34, standard error
= 3.59
Sample 5: mean = 98.89, standard deviation = 7.97, standard error = 2.52
The standard error should be 2.59, as we saw when we used all five of the
samples. So the standard error results using just one sample don’t match up
exactly, but each one is close.
Before we leave hypothetical examples and move to trades, one other
concept needs to be explored: the variance of the infinite sample. In the
previous example, our five 10‐trade samples lined up pretty well with our

15

infinite trade mean of 100. The distance of each sample from the mean of
100 wasn’t very far. The reason they did is because a standard deviation of
10 was chosen for the infinite sample when the thousands of trades that
formed the infinite trade distribution were generated. Using a standard
deviation of 10 means that 68.3 of the randomly generated trades will
range from 90 to 110 (100 minus 1 standard deviation to 100 plus 1 stan-
dard deviation); 95.4 percent of the randomly generated trades will range
from 80 to 120 (100 minus 2 standard deviations to 100 plus 2 standard
deviations); and 99.7 percent of the trades will range from 70 to 130
(100 minus 3 standard deviations to 100 plus 3 standard deviations). Real
trade distributions are never this tight. Losers might be hundreds or even
thousands of dollars, while winners can range the same distance, or more,
to the plus side. Instead of the three-standard-deviation range of $60 we
had with our example, real trade distributions can have ranges of many
thousands of dollars. The bottom line is that the bigger the standard de-
viation (or variance) of the underlying distribution, the bigger the stan-
dard error. The following example parallels the previous example, but
instead of a standard deviation of 10 for the infinite sample, we’ll use
a value of 500. That gives us a three-standard-deviation range of 3,000;
99.7 percent of the trades will be between ‐$1,500 and +$1,500 from
the average profit‐per‐trade, or trade mean. Here are the results of pulling
five 10‐trade samples from the “infinite trade pool” whose statistics are a
trade mean of $100 and a trade standard deviation of $500.
Sample 1: mean = $263.29, standard error = $165.81
Sample 2: mean = −$31.05, standard error = $151.96
Sample 3: mean = −$71.57, standard error = $95.18
Sample 4: mean = $198.69, standard error = $148.14
Sample 5: mean = $275.74, standard error = $195.65
Average mean = $127.02
Based on the average mean of $127.02, this set of samples turned out
more positive than the $100 infinite sample mean. The results show the ex-
panded standard error when the infinite distribution has a relatively large
variance; instead of a standard error of 2.59 when the standard deviation has
10, the standard error now ranges from $95.18 to $195.65 using a standard
deviation of $500.
Again, what this means to the trader is that if his or her back‐test yielded
10 trades that averaged a profit of $275.74 with a standard error of $195.65
(Sample 5), he or she could be 68.3 percent confident that the true average

profit-per-trade of the strategy was between $80.09 and $471.39. Maybe
you would be willing to roll the dice with those odds and trade the strategy,
but consider this: You could just as easily have yielded Sample 2 in your
back‐test. In that case your 68.3 percent chance sample mean would lie
between −$183.01 and $120.91. Not attractive at all.
This example can be used to highlight another problem we’re all sub-
ject to. Think of each of the five samples as a separate back‐test, maybe
with one parameter value changed slightly per run. We’re likely to think
we’re on the right track with and Samples 1 and 5, and on the wrong
track with Samples 2 and 3, but the results come from the same distribu-
tion. We just can’t make a judgment on a small sample with a relatively
large standard deviation.
Testing the Hypothesis that Curve‐Fitting Is Pro-
portional to the Number of T rades in the Sample
Using Real Trade Data
After that detour, let’s get back to our hypothesis testing with real trade
data. Gold was selected because I have daily data going back to 1975. To
generate a lot of trades, a 20‐day moving average reversal system was used.
It goes long when the average of the last 20 closes is higher than yesterday’s
average, and closes the long position and goes short when today’s average of
the last 20 closes is less than yesterday’s. The following are some the back‐
test result statistics:
Winning trades: 233
Losing trades: 450
Total profit: $22,400
Average trade: $32.80
Largest winning trade: $16,230
Largest losing trade: $5,150
Standard deviation of the trades: $1,884
For this analysis, it’s not important whether this is a tradeable strategy
or not. All we want to know is how many trades we need in a sample to
approximate the entire population’s results. For the analysis, the profit
or loss value for each of the 683 gold trades was placed in a file. Then
for each sample size the appropriate number of trades was randomly
selected and the mean of that sample computed. This was done 10,000
times for each sample size. The standard deviation of the 10,000 sample

means was used to compute the standard error for that sample size. To
summarize for a sample size of 90 trades: 10,000 times 90 trades were
randomly selected from the gold trade file containing the 683 trades;
the average of the 90 trades for each of the 10,000 sets of trades was
computed; the standard deviation of the 10,000 mean values was com-
puted; and then the standard error was computed by dividing the stan-
dard error by the square root of 90. The answer for that computation
was about $200. Figure 2.3 shows the standard error versus the number
of trades randomly selected for each sample. Sample size was limited to
300 because there were only 683 trades in our trade file.

Number of Trades in Each Sample
The standard error was computed by generating 10,000 samples of each
sample size, then computing the average value per sample, and then comput-
ing the standard deviation of the 10,000 averages. Sample sizes were varied
from 10 trades per sample to 300 trades per sample in 10‐trade increments.
Figure 2.3 shows that as the number of trades in each sample increases, the
standard error decreases. This is in line with our hypothesis. At 300 trades
per sample, the standard error is about $100. That’s still a rather large dif-
ference from the true distribution; the one standard deviation range for that
case is the mean trade of $32.80 minus $100, or ‐$67.20, to $32.80 plus
$100, or $132.80. Clearly a bigger sample size is needed to accurately defi ne
the underlying infi nite sample, but we’re pretty much at the limit of the sam-
ple size we can use with 683 gold trades standing in as our “infi nite sample.”

Figure 2.4 shows that even when the sample size is 1,000 trades, the stan-

For a trader there is a practical lesson that can be learned from the fore-
going discussion. The larger the variance of your back‐test results, the bigger
your sample size needs to be to have confi dence that the results are a true
indication of how the strategy will trade in the future. In the fi rst example,
the standard deviation of the trade sample was 10. That yielded a standard

error of about 2.5 when we pulled 10 samples from the distribution. When
the standard deviation of the trade sample was increased to 500 and 10
samples were used, the standard error jumped to a range of about 95 to 195.
And from the last graph (Figure 2.4), we see that the standard error is about
500 when the standard deviation of the trades grew to 2,316. There’s good
news and bad news about these facts for both shorter‐term and longer‐term
traders:
Shorter‐term strategies will have smaller average profits (bad news) but
■
smaller average losses (good news). The standard deviation across all
trades will be relatively smaller, so the standard error will be relatively
smaller and fewer samples will be needed to minimize curve‐fitting
(good news).
Longer‐term strategies will have larger average profits (good news) but
■
larger average losses (bad news). The standard deviation across all trades
will be relatively larger, so the standard error will be relatively larger and
more samples will be needed to minimize curve‐fitting (bad news).
■ Testing for Curve-Fitting
The statistics are over. The point of the previous section was that for most
trading systems (I won’t say all, but I’m thinking all) you need many
hundreds to thousands of trades in your back‐test to minimize the effects
of curve‐fitting and gain the confidence that real trading will match the pa-
rameters of your back‐test. I don’t expect someone to statistically test his
model to see if it’s curve‐fit. I have a relatively easy and robust way for you
to convince yourself whether a system you develop is minimally curve‐fit,
or not. It’s called “Build, Rebuild, and Compare,” or BRAC. The method in-
volves using all the historical data for the instrument(s) you intend to trade
in your development sample. As you build the strategy, keep track of the
steps you took and the selection logic you used, and if you wind up develop-
ing a strategy that performs well, you’ve completed the “Build” part. Next,
cut some data off the end of your historical data. If you were using 20 years
of daily‐bar data, you might cut the last year off. Then with the smaller his-
torical database “Rebuild” your strategy using the same steps and decision
criteria you used the first time. The last step is to input all the historical data
into the “Rebuilt” strategy and “Compare” the performance over the period
of the withheld data with the performance of the first strategy over the same

period. If the performance is similar, you can have pretty good confidence
that your strategy will hold up in real trading.
BRAC Example
Let’s use the data for the 37 domestic commodities we used in the previ-
ous curve‐fitting discussion and build a moving average system just like we
did for the Swiss franc curve‐fitting example earlier in this chapter. In that
example, we used the following steps and used the accompanying selection
logic:
Vary the number of days for the moving average from 10 to 120 in 10‐day
■
increments. Select the number of days that yields the largest profit.
Vary the number of days for the look‐back filter from the moving aver-
■
age value plus 10 days to 200 in 10‐day increments. Select the look‐back
value with the largest profit.
Vary the catastrophic stop value from $250 to $2,000 in $250 incre-
■
ments. Select the stop value that yields the largest profit.
When those three steps and the associated decision logic are implement-
ed, we get the results shown in Table 2.5 from the start of the CSI data for
each of the 37 commodities until the end of 2010.

average is 100. That is the value selected. Table 2.6 shows the results when

longer‐term trend are taken.

The largest profit is seen with a look‐back filter of 200 days, so that will
be the value we select. Now let’s add a catastrophic stop. Table 2.7 shows

The system developed across all the data had 2,103 winning trades, had
4,326 losing trades, and netted $2,555,125 across its lifetime. For the last

Winning trades: 101

Now let’s go back and rebuild the strategy using the same steps and logic, but

It may surprise you that the parameter values at each step turned out to
be the same as those using the entire data sample. I’m not surprised, because
if you develop strategies with thousands of trades, the best parameter set
doesn’t flop around from year to year. When I developed a system I market
called Aberration on a basket of 35 commodities, the best parameter value
was 80 days of data. Over 25 years later that’s still the best parameter value
and now I use a basket of 57 worldwide commodities. So in this BRAC test,
the one year of data withheld from the second development yielded the

BACK‐TESTS
same results as our initial results when it is included back in the back‐test.
In the succeeding chapters we’ll be developing more strategies. We’ll do
a BRAC test on some and in cases we’ll see an element of curve‐fitting.
But remember: There’s always a certain element of curve‐fitting because
we don’t have an infinite data set and we’re developing a solution based on
historical data. The key is to minimize curve‐fitting as much as possible.
BRAC versus Out‐of‐Sample Testing
It’s funny how some things somehow get elevated to cult status as the be‐all
and end‐all solution to a given problem. In the trading world, I consistently
run across three things that I would put in that category:
1. Monte Carlo analysis will tell you how much your strategy will really
make, and what the worst draw‐down will really be.
2. A divergence signal is a very powerful entry technique.
3. The only trustworthy measure of a good system is out‐of‐sample testing.
I present my thoughts and analysis on Monte Carlo analysis and diver-
gence elsewhere in this book, but this is an appropriate time to talk about
out‐of‐sample testing. One of the questions asked most at seminars I present
is: How much out‐of‐sample testing do you do before you trade a system?
I don’t do any. If a developed system passes the BRAC test and it fits with
the other systems I’m trading, I’ll trade it. The main problem with out‐
of‐sample testing is there is no performance reference for the out‐of‐sample
results. Suppose you develop a system on all the available data and your
out‐of‐sample test is “watch how it trades for the next year.” Y our 20‐year
back‐test, which includes thousands of trades, averages $20,000 per year
with an average draw‐down of $10,000 a year and a max draw‐down of
$20,000. When you watch it for a year out of sample, you lose $5,000 and
have a $15,000 draw‐down along the way. Is this a failed out‐of‐sample test?
I think it depends. Suppose the last five years of trading looked like this:
Year Return Max Draw‐Down
5 years ago: $30,000 $5,000
4 years ago: ‐$5,000 $15,000
3 years ago: $40,000 $5,000
2 years ago: $15,000 $15,000
1 year ago: $20,000 $10,000
Average $20,000 $10,000

If your out‐of‐sample year had been four years ago, the $5,000 loss and
$15,000 draw‐down would have been the “right” answer, but based on this
test most people would discard the strategy.
If your out‐of‐sample methodology is to develop the strategy on 19 out
of 20 years and then see how it does when you add back in the missing
year, you are missing critical data. A shortfall of data is a huge development
problem. If we had infinite data, this chapter wouldn’t exist. Why make the
problem even worse by withholding it?
The BRAC methodology solves both of these problems by giving you a
performance reference for data not included in the development sample,
and by letting you use all available data for your development sample at the
same time.
Last Word on Curve‐Fitting
I think there’s a conspiracy out there that leads traders into the curve‐fitting
trap. The conspiracy is perpetrated by companies that sell development soft-
ware. Almost every package has the “chart paradigm” where you put one, or
more, charts in a window and develop a strategy on the data for the one sym-
bol on that chart. That leads to developing a solution on one set of data that is
probably too small. Further, the point‐and‐click ease with which you can add
trading rules, stops, and filters, and then optimize all of them, leads the trader
to think “this is how it’s supposed to be done.” I say it’s a conspiracy because
the software companies know there’s a curve‐fitting problem with that meth-
odology, but it’s so easy for a potential customer to “find the holy grail” in a
two‐week trial with this paradigm that a sale of the software is almost assured.
A better solution is to offer packages that allow the user to develop across
a basket of symbols at the same time, but it’s hard work to find a tradeable
solution in that manner, and the spectacular trade charts you see in the ads
won’t look nearly as good.
■ Other Impediments to a Valid Back-Test
If you develop a strategy and it fails in real‐time trading, I’d guess there’s a
90 percent probability that you curve‐fit the strategy to the data. But there
are other possible reasons:
Assuming every point in a bar was a trade point.
■
Dual orders within a bar.
■

■
The relatively good thing about these impediments is that their sever-
ity lessens as your profit‐per‐trade goal goes up. If you develop on daily
bars and try to make $500, or more, per trade, one, or more, of these is-
sues might dampen your return, but they probably won’t kill the strategy. If
you’re looking to scalp $50 profits two or three times a day, any one of these
things could kill the system and make it a net loser.
Assuming Every Point in a Bar Was a Trade Point
If you use daily bars and a stock has an open, high, low, and close for the day
of 101, 101, 99, and 99, your back‐testing platform will probably assume
that there were 200 trading points that day: one at each cent of the range
from 101 down to 99. In reality, the stock could have opened at 101 gapped
down to 100.5 and then traded down in 1‐cent increments to the closing
price of 99. If your strategy had a short entry at 100.95 on a stop, your soft-
ware will probably give you that price, but in reality, you’d have been filled
at 100.5, or less. If you’re a longer‐term trader, the $0.45 won’t kill you,
but if you’re trying to make $0.10 a trade, that $0.45 is four and a half trades
of profit. The solution to this back‐testing impediment is to go ahead and de-
velop on daily bars, but if you find something you like, do a comparison of a
portion of your daily‐bar results with the results using the same strategy on
finer resolution bars: five‐minute bars, one‐minute bars, tick data (tick data
is a plot of every trade point, not a bar that contains summary information
for all trades in a given time‐frame), and so forth.
Dual Orders within a Bar
Many strategies actually have one or more orders valid for a single bar.
Examples are:
Breakout systems where you place a buy stop and a sell stop before the
■
market opens and let the market decide your position based on the first
breakout.
Counter‐trend, or trading range systems where you put a sell limit above
■
the current price, and a buy limit below current price and hope that price
moves up or down to your entry price then moves back the other way

GNIPOLEVED
and you’re taken out of the trade with a profit when the other limit order
acts as a profit‐target.
Contingent orders where you put in an entry order and a contingent
■
order for stop protection should the entry execute.
The problem with these types of orders is that there’s no way to know
which order gets hit first if the bar range encompasses both orders. In the
second example in this list, it doesn’t matter, because both trades will always
be winners, but in the other two it does. Again, the way to get around this
back‐testing issue is to go to finer resolution data to find out which order
really got hit first.
Realistically Accounting for Transaction Costs
Transaction costs include slippage and commission. (Actually, taxes on prof-
its should probably be included, but no one talks about that.) When I re-
leased my first commercial trading system in 1993, I included transaction
costs of $75 per contract for every 60 trading days the trade lasted. The
60‐day addition was to account for rollover costs from one contract to the
next. Back then a typical broker would charge you about $25 round‐turn
per futures contact, and the pit would find a way to take another $50 away
from you no matter what your order was or when you placed it (remember
the dreaded words, “fast market conditions”). We’ve come a long way from
then. Brokers are much more competitive (you can trade a futures contract
from $2 to $5 a round‐turn, and $25,000 worth of stock for about $5 to
$10, in‐and‐out), and the electronic markets have reduced bid/ask spreads
to 1 to a few ticks, except at night. So the impact of transaction costs on a
trade is much less than it used to be. But if you’re looking to make relatively
small profits on a strategy, realistic transaction costs need to be factored in.
The following are the development slippage numbers I use in my back‐
testing; you can use the actual commission numbers of your own broker.
Stocks
I only trade stocks that have an average liquidity of $20,000,000 over the last
five trading days. I define liquidity as closing price multiplied by volume. I
almost never use stop orders intra‐day for liquidity considerations. I use the
following types of orders and expect slippage to average the figure noted:
Market-on-open orders: A penalty of $0.015 from the print open; that’s
1.5 cents.

27

BACK‐TESTS
Market-on-close orders: A penalty of $0.0025 from the print close; that’s
1/4 of a penny.
Limit orders: See the “Limit Order Mania” section that follows.
There is something you should be aware of if your account size is rela-
tively small. An odd lot is now classified as an order for less than 100 shares.
If you’re doing market-on-open orders for an odd lot, your slippage will
average much more than an opening order for a round lot (larger than
100 shares). That’s because odd‐lot orders aren’t included in the opening
pair‐offs the exchanges do and only get filled with other matching odd‐lot
orders. Slippage on these can be so large, I avoid doing them.
Commodities
I’ll trade even the more illiquid commodities if the profit‐per‐trade for the
strategy is relatively high, but I expect more slippage with them.
Market and stop orders during the day: $25
Market and stop exit orders during the night session: I wait until the day
session when the spreads are better to get out.
Foreign Exchange (FX)
I’m not a big FX trader, but when I do; my orders are generally limit
orders because I consider FX easiest to trade in a counter‐trend manner.
If you have a FX broker, not a market‐maker, and you’re trading pairs that
involve the six major currencies, three to four pips round-turn is a good
number.
Limit Order Mania
At some point, I’m sure nearly every trader sees a potential “golden
goose” in limit orders. On the surface, they eliminate all concerns about
slippage because you get your price, or better. But the reality is that
slippage occurs in a different way with limit orders: missed entries. I
used to trade a stock system that put out 20 to 30 buy limit orders each
day. I only wanted 10 entries, so when 10 fills occurred, my software
would cancel the rest. The system made money, but never as good as my
back‐tests. What was happening was that I missed some of the best fills,
but always got filled on the ones that traded down to my price, and kept
going down from there. In other words, I missed some big winners, but
always seemed to get the losers.

If price goes down to your buy limit price, you only get filled for sure if
there is sufficient liquidity on the other side of the order to take out all the
buy orders at that price. Otherwise you miss getting filled at all, or get only
a partial fill. Many will argue that in the very liquid markets like the S&P
and FX currencies there is plenty of liquidity at all price points. That’s just
not so. Even trading one contract, or one $100,000 FX unit, price can trade
at your limit order and you may not get filled, but your back‐test software
will assume you did. I’ve sat at my screen many times with hundreds of bids
sitting at my limit buy order price, saying, “Come on, give it to me,” and
it doesn’t happen. So the problem for strategies that use limit orders for
entry, or as a profit‐target exit, is that you will miss some of the fills that
just hit your price, and your results will always be a little worse than your
back‐test. If your profit‐per‐trade is relatively large, you will probably just
see a performance drop‐off in your real‐time trades versus your hypotheti-
cal trades. But if your profit‐per‐trade is relatively small, this problem could
be a deal‐breaker.
For systems that use limit orders to scalp small profits, the drop‐off in
real fills from hypothetical back‐test fills can be so great that a money ma-
chine turns into a money pit. Here’s a real example. I implemented the fol-
lowing logic in “auto‐trading” software on the emini S&P with a five‐minute
chart after a back‐test showed fantastic results:
Entry Orders
Limit buy point = Close – 0.75 points
Limit sell point = Close + 0.75 points
Stop after Entry
Stop = $75 from entry price (1.5 emini S&P points)
Limit Order Profit Targets
Sell to cover limit = Close + 0.75 points
Buy to cover limit = Close – 0.75 points
During the one‐month period of March 12, 2011, to April 12, 2011, the
strategy had these back‐test statistics:
Wining trades: 928
Losing trades: 330
Total profit: $21,525
Profit‐per‐trade: $15.90
Max draw‐down: $1,262.50

The hypothetical equity curve was just about a straight line from the bot-
tom left to the top right of the chart, while in real trading, just about all of
the losing trades would occur, but you’d only get about half the winners.
The only one who would marvel at the strategy would be your broker, as he
collects over 600 round‐turn commissions a month.
■ Conclusion
After you develop a tradeable strategy, you want it to trade in real‐time
like it back‐tested. This chapter illustrated the most probable reasons for a
performance drop‐off. By far, the likeliest reason is curve‐fitting in the de-
velopment process. As you develop, I urge you to ask yourself the following
question: Can I be curve‐fitting in any way by doing this step?
Appendix D has some examples of curve‐fitting that might surprise you.
I urge you to look them over. The safest way to ensure a low degree of
curve‐fitting is to do a BRAC test after you find a strategy you’re interested
in trading.

his chapter explores the trading characteristics of three market classes:
stocks, commodities, and foreign exchange (FX) currency pairs. Each
of these classes is traded worldwide, and each has tremendous liquidity for
ease of trading. Many traders assume that every market should be traded the
same way, but, for whatever reason, market classes do behave differently.
Moreover, within a market class the individual instruments behave differ-
ently in different time frames (monthly, weekly, daily, intra‐day bars). This
chapter will illustrate these differences and show a general approach for
determining the characteristics of a trading class.
Finding the tendencies of a market class is a shortcut to finding good
trading approaches for that class. If a market tends to trend in a certain time
frame, trend‐following techniques like moving averages, breakouts, trend‐
lines, and so forth are a good place to start the development process. If
a market tends to counter‐trend behavior, overbought/oversold oscillators
like RSI, stochastic, or momentum might be good starting points.

■ Markets Are Different: Daily Bars
To illustrate that market classes can move in fundamentally different ways,
we’ll use an easy‐to‐understand process on daily stock and commodity data.
After the data is presented, you’ll probably agree that stocks move primar-
ily in a counter‐trend manner (weak stocks outperform strong stocks to
the upside), while commodities tend to trend (strong commodities tend to
continue upward, while weak commodities tend to continue downward).
The process uses the following steps:
Step 1: Determine baseline buy‐and‐hold performance. At the start of each
month, every member of the two classes will be invested in. For stocks,
the equity existing at the end of the month will be divided by the num-
ber of stocks in the class and the number of shares representing that dol-
lar value will be bought. At the end of the month, those shares in each
stock are sold at the end‐of‐month prevailing price. For commodities,
one contract of each commodity will be bought at the price on the open
of the first trading day of the month. Those contracts will be cashed out
at the closing price at the end of the month. For stocks, we’ll use a base-
line of 1,714 highly liquid stocks from the year 2000 through the end
of 2011. The baseline performance metric for stocks will be percent
profit‐per‐trade for the month. For commodities, we’ll use a basket of
56 worldwide commodities over the same years, and the performance
metric will be dollar return for the one‐lot trade.
Step 2: Determine the performance of a trend‐following strategy on strong
stocks and commodities. This step duplicates the buy‐and‐hold methodol-
ogy and metrics except the stocks and commodities that are bought at the
first of each month are those whose closing price at the end of the month
is one standard deviation above the average of the last 20 closes. The stan-
dard deviation measure is the standard deviation of the last 20 closes.
Step 3: Determine the performance of a counter‐trend buy strategy on
weak stocks and commodities. This step uses the same methodology and
metrics as the trend‐following strategy on strong stocks, except the in-
struments that are bought are those whose closing price is one standard
deviation of price below the average of the last 20 closes.

return across the 12 months of the year. The average profit‐per‐trade num-

2011 0.03 –1.11 1.79
Average Profit‐per‐
Trade (Percent) 0.71 0.16 1.56
The results in Table 3.1 show that the average profit‐per‐trade for the
buy‐and‐hold strategy across the basket of 1,714 stocks is 0.71 percent per
month. If you adopt the trend‐following strategy of buying strong stocks,
you will only make 0.16 percent per trade, which underperforms buy‐
and‐hold by about 70 percent per month. But if you adopt a counter‐trend
strategy of buying weak stocks at the start of each month, you will make
1.56 percent per trade, which outperforms buy‐and‐hold by over 100 percent
per month. Clearly, the easiest approach to take when working with daily‐bar
stock data and an intermediate time frame, like a month, is to buy weakness.
You will note that this basket of stocks outperformed the general
market over the same time frame. This is due to survivorship basis. The
1,714 stocks were the most liquid stocks at the end of 2011 when the
analysis was conducted. Through the years other stocks would have
made the list, but they are no longer trading, many because of poor
performance. Their contribution would have brought the returns in line
with the actual market performance. Still, this is not considered a major
flaw in the study. The same market data was presented to each of the
three strategies.

Table 3.2 shows the results of the three‐step process on the basket of
56 commodities. All transactions are broken out by year. The average profit‐
per‐year is the sum of each transactions profit for each month in dollars
divided by the total number of long transactions for the year.

Average per
Trade $66 $158 $23
The results in Table 3.2 show that the average buy‐and‐hold profit‐per‐
trade across the basket of 56 commodities is $66. If you adopt a trend‐
following strategy of buying strong commodities, you will outperform
buy‐and‐hold by $92 per transaction, almost 140 percent. If you adopt a
counter‐trend strategy of buying weak commodities at the start of each
month, you will underperform buy‐and‐hold by about $43 per transac-
tion. Clearly, the easiest approach to take when working with daily‐bar
commodities is to be a trend‐follower: buy strong commodities and sell
weak commodities.
When I first ran this analysis, I was surprised that the counter‐trend strat-
egy of buying weak commodities actually made the small profit of $23 per
trade. I had expected to see the approach lose, on average, per trade. I reran
the counter‐trend strategy across all the commodity data from 1980 to the
end of 2011. That run had each trade losing $45 per trade on average. I’m
guessing that the disparity is due to the rise of asset class funds in the last

decade. These funds are buy‐only in one or more asset classes like the metals
or energies. To them, weakness in a commodity in their asset class looks like
a buying opportunity. As you develop commodity systems you’ll find that
the long‐side trades usually make two or three times as much as the short‐
side trades. Part of the reason is evident in Table 3.2. Any time you make a
buy trade, you have a $66 per month profit built in to the trade (the average
profit across all buy‐and‐hold‐for‐a‐month trades).
The $66 per trade average of the buy‐and‐hold trades is not just an anom-
aly of the 2000–2011 time frame. Using the same 56 commodities, I looked
back to the year 1980, and the buy‐and‐hold for that entire period was
$50 per trade. Clearly the path of least resistance in the commodity world is up.
Results of the Three‐Step Process for FX Pairs
The preceding analysis is relatively easy to perform on any asset class or time
frame. In FX trading, there are seven major currencies: the U.S. dollar, the
euro currency (before 1999, the deutsche mark), the Swiss franc, the British
pound, the Japanese yen, the Australian dollar, and the Canadian dollar. Each
currency can be traded against every currency, so there are 21 major pairs.
When trading FX pairs, a “one lot” of 100,000 units of the currency was
used and the results of each trade converted to dollars. The previous analysis
was conducted on the daily‐bar data of these FX pairs going back to the start
of the year 2000. The results are shown in Table 3.3.

The results in Table 3.3 show that the average buy‐and‐hold performance
per trade across the basket of 21 FX pairs is a loss of $87 per month. If you
adopt a trend‐following strategy of buying strong pairs, you will underper-
form buy‐and‐hold by $14 per transaction. If you adopt a counter‐trend
strategy of buying weak FX pairs at the start of each month, you will out-
perform buy‐and‐hold by $265 per transaction. Since FX pairs are traded
without any penalty both long and short, the counter‐trend approach of
buying weak FX pairs and selling strong pairs is the path of least resistance.
The results of implementing this counter‐trend approach are shown in the
last column of the table. The average profit‐per‐trade traded in this manner
is $137; that’s $224 more than the baseline buy‐and‐hold.
FX Pairs Are Generally Considered Great Trenders
These results may be surprising to some traders. It is commonly held that
the currencies are great trending instruments. This belief may be due to the
tendency of the commodity currencies to trend. The popularity of speculative
FX trading is relatively new, while the trading of currency commodities dates
back to the 1970s; six currency commodities have traded since then. They
correspond to the major currencies versus the U.S. dollar. Table 3.4 com-
pares buy‐and‐hold on the six major FX pairs against the dollar versus their

counterpart commodity currencies. The last two columns compare the results
of trading a trend‐following methodology on both the FX pairs and the com-
modity currencies.
Table 3.4 raises two questions:
Why is buy‐and‐hold so different between the FX pairs and their cor-
■
responding commodity currencies? The FX dollar‐based pairs average
$22 per transaction, while the corresponding commodities make almost
10 times as much at $214 per transaction.
When trading FX pairs, why is trend‐following profitable with the six
■
major currencies against the dollar, when trend‐following across all 21
major currency pairs is a net loser?
Regarding the first question, two possibilities leap to mind. First, the
disparity might just be a time‐frame issue. Maybe over the long haul the dif-
ference isn’t so pronounced. Another strong possibility is the “time to carry”
pricing of commodities.
More perplexing is the second issue: the trend‐following nature of the
dollar‐based FX pairs, and the counter‐trend‐following nature of the rest
of the pairs on daily‐bar data. Table 3.5 shows the results of implement-
ing our trend‐following approach on each of the seven types of currency
pairs.

You’ll note that if a similar table were presented to represent the results
of counter‐trend‐following on FX pairs, the numbers would be exactly the
same, but with the leading sign reversed: A positive $100 would be a shown
as negative $100 for that year.
The dollar‐based pairs are strongly suited to trend‐following, while the
pound, Canadian dollar, and Swiss franc are strongly suited to counter‐
trend‐following trading (the negative results in the table would be re-
versed to positive if the logic was a counter‐trend entry instead of a trend‐
following entry). Something that begs to be looked at is combinations
of trend‐following currencies with other trend‐following currencies, and
counter‐trend‐following currencies with other counter‐trend‐following
currencies. Based on the information in Table 3.5, these are the pairs in
each group:
Trend‐following pairs: dollar and Australian dollar, and dollar and euro

Counter‐trend‐following pairs: pound and Canadian dollar, pound and

Table 3.6 clearly shows the benefit of trading each instrument with its
trading tendency. Further breaking out the numbers, there were 84 winning
months of trades and 69 losing months of trades for the trend‐following
pairs, for a total profit of $103,421. For the counter‐trend‐following pairs,
there were 192 winning months of trades, 166 losing months, and a total
profit of $225,376. Additionally, Table 3.6 shows that a losing year for one
set of instruments is usually a winning year for the other. In other words,
when markets are choppy and trends don’t persist, the counter‐trend in-
struments tend to do well, and when the markets are too “trendy” for the
counter‐trend instruments, the trend‐following ones do well. There’s only
one year (2005) where both sets of instruments had a losing year.
Before we leave the FX pairs tendency analysis, let’s look at the
pairs that have one strong trend‐following member and one strong
counter‐trend‐following member. (The Australian dollar only averaged
$3 per transaction and the euro only $22 for the trend‐following strat-
egy, so they are not strongly trend‐following or strongly counter‐trend
and will be left out.) Those pairs are: dollar and pound, dollar and
Canadian dollar, dollar and yen, and dollar and Swiss franc. The results
are shown in Table 3.7.

Using daily bars, when you mate a strong trend‐following tendency cur-
rency with a strong counter‐trend‐following tendency currency, the result
is a stalemate: The resultant instrument doesn’t consistently trend or consis-
tently move in a counter‐trend‐following manner.
Summary of Daily‐Bar Tendencies
To summarize what’s been presented so far in this chapter, I believe stocks
are primarily counter‐trend‐following tendency instruments on daily data;
commodities are primarily trend‐following instruments on daily data; and
overall, FX pairs are primarily counter‐trend‐following tendency instru-
ments, but with FX, there are pairs with weak to strong trend‐following
tendencies.
■ Markets Are Different: Intra-Day Bars
I recommend some form of “tendency analysis” be conducted on every in-
strument you wish to trade in the time frame you wish to trade it. If you
want to trade five‐minute bars, it pays to know whether the instrument
tends to trend or not. To illustrate, we’ll use hourly bar data for stocks,
commodities, and the FX pairs. For stocks we’ll use the 100 stocks in the
Nasdaq 100 from 2000 through the end of 2010. For commodities, we’ll use
all the electronically traded U.S. commodities from 2000 through the end
of 2010. And for the 21 FX pairs, we’ll use hourly data from 2002 through
the end of 2010.
Trading Stocks on Intra‐Day Bars
The trend‐following criteria for stocks will be to go long on the next bar on
all hours following a close one standard deviation above the 10‐bar average
of the hourly closes. Exit will be done on the close of the next day. Table 3.8
shows the results.
Again, the stock database had an upward bias as the buy‐and‐hold
average daily return of 0.07 percent per day per stock shows. But the
buy‐and‐hold return was almost doubled using the trend‐following ap-
proach on the hourly data. This is in clear contrast to the daily‐bar anal-
ysis on stocks, which rewarded a counter‐trend‐following approach.
This shows that instruments that have a trending tendency on one time

frame don’t necessarily have the same trending tendency in other time
frames.
Trading Commodities on Intra‐Day Bars
For commodities, 25 highly liquid electronic‐contract commodities were
used for the analysis. Buy and hold was determined by buying each day at
the close and closing out the trade at next day’s close. The commodities
were also traded with a trend‐following approach: If the close was one
standard deviation or more above the average of the last 10 hourly closes,
the commodity was bought; if the close was one standard deviation or less
below the average of the last 10 hourly closes, the commodity was sold.
The trades were closed out on the close of the next day. Table 3.9 shows
the results.
Again the commodities show a sharp upward bias, as evidenced by the
buy‐and‐hold average profit‐per‐day, per-commodity of $21.26. The trend‐
following approach exceeded buy‐and‐hold by over 40 percent, $30.05 per
trade versus $21.26 for buy‐and‐hold. In the case of commodities, both
daily bars and hourly bars have a tendency to trend.

The FX pairs had a tendency to fall over this time frame as the baseline
loss of $11.64 per pair per day shows. The trend‐following approach beats
the baseline by over $20 a trade, a $9.17 per‐trade profit for the trend‐fol-
lowing approach versus an $11.64 per‐trade loss for the baseline. As was
the case with stocks, the tendency of FX pairs differs on daily‐bar data and
hourly data.
■ Why the Difference in Trending Tendencies
between Classes of Instruments?
I hope this chapter’s analysis has convinced you that classes of instruments
have different trending tendencies. An obvious question is: Why? In the case
of daily‐bar stocks, I believe they are primarily counter‐trend instruments
because they are emotionally driven rather than value driven. The emotions
of fear and greed cause a herd reaction to movement. When stocks are ral-
lying sharply, greed causes investors to jump in so they don’t miss the move.
As more and more jump in, the valuations increase beyond fair value until
inevitably there are no more buyers and prices head down. At that point,
fear sets in. Profits quickly turn to losses, and the investor sells at any cost
to just get out. When there are no more sellers, valuations are below fair
value and an up‐cycle starts. Though I can’t prove those statements, I offer
the following evidence:
When you buy stock you are given a piece of paper, the stock certificate,
not a hard asset like a gold bar or bushel of grain, which forms the basis of
value for commodities. As the dot-com bubble proved, nobody really knows
what a company is worth. Accounting games put out the story the company
wants to tell, which clouds transparency. Without a clear marker of worth,
traders/investors are at a loss to knowing whether a stock is a good buy or not.
Through the stock market bubble and subsequent crash, from 1997 to
2003, the stock market as measured by the S&P 500 futures contract had a
daily range exceeding 1 percent of closing price 83.6 percent of the time.
During the same time frame, our basket of 56 commodities (less the stock
index futures) had a daily range exceeding 1 percent of price or more only
53.6 percent of the time. The commodity currencies had a daily range of
1 percent of price or more only 26 percent of the days during the same time
frame. I can think of no fundamental reason why any stock market should
move 1 percent of its value four out of every five days. I conclude that it
must be trader emotions moving the market up and down.

■ Conclusion
Different asset classes trade differently, and within the same asset class, trad-
ing characteristics can differ by time frame. It pays to perform a little analy-
sis on what you want to trade, and in the time frame you want to trade it,
before you start development. This chapter has illustrated an easy process
you can use to find out the path of least resistance, which will give you a
head‐start in the development process.

CHAPTER 4
Trading System
Elements: Entries
T
he development of a trading strategy is an iterative process, but the
start of the process is always the entry idea. If you are trading an
asset class, or even a single instrument like a stock index, you need to
have some idea how that class or instrument trades, and then test your
45
ideas on how to enter the market at the appropriate time. The entry idea
might be as simple as “I’ll trend‐follow by going long after two up closes,
or short after two down closes,” or as complex as “I’ll wait until I have a
one‐third retracement in the third wave of an Elliott wave cycle and in-
crementally buy in a position at any further Fibonacci retracement level.”
For many, the entry idea comes from the study of charts; recurring up or
down moves seem to happen after a certain chart setup. Some entry ideas
are stimulated by the technical analysis literature. For others, like me, test
ideas just pop up when I’m grocery shopping or mowing the lawn. How-
ever you do it, if you find a good entry idea, the rest of the development
process is pretty straightforward.
This chapter is the first of three that will detail the process of build-
ing a strategy. Chapter 5 explores trade exits, and Chapter 6 looks at
trading filters that are used, primarily in conjunction with the entry, to
screen in good trading setups or screen out bad setups. Through these
three chapters, we will build a stock and commodity strategy to illustrate
the process. There will be other examples where warranted. As the system
is built, a simple money management metric will be computed from the
equity curve that shows the worth of the latest development step. The

process illustrated in these three chapters is how I develop systems. You’ll
go through the process many times before you find something truly trade-
able. But even in the failures you’ll learn something about the market
you’re trying to trade. Many times it’s the failure that causes the break-
through. If some step makes things much worse, doing the reverse might
just be the right thing to do.
Because of its topic’s importance, this chapter will start with a process
that allows a developer to determine how good his entry idea is. I call it de-
termining the entry power of a setup. Using the methodology, we’ll quantify
a number of popular entry techniques.
■ Entry: The Most Important System Element
Many will disagree with the statement that the entry is the most important
system element. If they’re trend‐followers, they say anyone can spot a trend
and jump onboard, but it’s when you get out that makes the difference. Sure,
when you get out is important, but the entry determines how soon and how
quickly you accrue profit on a trade. If you’ve got a good entry, you can get
out randomly and make a profit, on average, but you can’t exit randomly and
make a profit without a good entry, no matter how good your exit is. The
entry is your edge, just like the house’s edge in Vegas. On average, it makes
your trade immediately profitable; the rest of the system just determines
when the edge has run out and it’s time to exit.
Good entries have a power and persistence that are proportional to the
number of bars used for the setup logic. Bars are information. One tells you
little, but the more you have the better idea you should have of what’s next.
If your entry uses 10 bars of information, it will have a forecasting power
that builds profits to a certain level before succeeding bars either continue
the direction, or not. If your entry uses 20 bars of information, your profit
push should be higher and last longer than the 10‐bar entry. Similarly, with
50 bars of information, you get a bigger profit push and longer persistence.
Figure 4.1 illustrates the thought.
Does that mean more bars make a better signal? No. Your 10‐bar entry
might generate enough trades in the time the 50‐bar signal generated one
to be a better trading solution. It does mean that you can compare entry
signals on a common basis: the number of bars used to determine the entry.
Just take all the trades issued by each entry and accumulate the profit/loss
on succeeding days.

The following two entry examples illustrate entry power for the com-
modity class of tradeables:
T rend‐Following Entry 1: Buy when the close of the bar is above the
n‐day moving average. Exit the long position and go short when the
close of the bar is below the n‐day moving average.
Trend‐Following Entry 2: Buy when the shorter‐length n‐day moving
average closes above the longer n1‐day moving average. Sell when the
shorter‐length n‐day moving average closes below the n1‐day moving
average.
The trend‐following Entry 1 rules summarize the first basic system
that just about every trend‐follower tests. It is a complete, standalone
system because the exit of the first signal is the entry for the second. It
is always in the market and needs no other rules. The trend‐following
Entry 2 rules are a more sophisticated trend‐following strategy using
moving averages. In the first strategy, there are always a number of
whipsaw entries caused when no true trend is unfolding in the market-
place. The second entry system attempts to eliminate a number of these
whipsaws by having both averages confirm the trend. Using our entry
power methodology, Figures 4.2 and 4.3 summarize the entry power of
the two entries.

Figure 4.2 shows that the 10‐day moving average is an in ineff ective entry.
The profi ts from the day of entry out to 150 days later hug the $0 profi t line.
A 20‐day average reaches a maximum profi t point of about $50 per trade.
The 40‐day average almost reaches $80 of profi t per trade, and the 80‐day
average hits about $110 per trade after about 90 days.
There is an interesting anomaly on the graphs: For each line, the en-
try doesn’t finally become profitable until a number of days after the
entry. The 10‐day entry doesn’t go positive until 20 days after entry;
the 20‐day entry doesn’t go, and stay, positive until 10 days after entry;
the 40‐day entry doesn’t go positive until 7 days after entry; and the
80‐day entry doesn’t go, and stay, positive until 9 days after entry. If I
was going to use one of these entries, I’d try to take advantage of this
information. I’d look at delaying entry until the appropriate profitable
day based on the historic averages, or look at entering at a better price
with a limit order some measure away from the entry price of the open
following the close.
This anomaly points out what you are likely to see with a number of
common entries: Profi t doesn’t start to accrue until some number of days
after the signal. What I believe is happening in those cases is that the popu-
larity of the entry causes an abnormal number of traders to enter on those
signals. Even though the entry may ultimately be valid, there might not
be enough liquidity to support the abnormal number of entries and price

staggers back under the load. Eventually the market liquidity catches up
with the demand, and some days later the position moves into profi t. If
you’re using a popular entry, it pays to look at ways to take advantage of
the price pullback.

F igure 4 .3 shows that the 5‐day and 10‐day two‐average entry system is
not worth trading, as the profi t stays near $0 for the entire 150‐day post‐
entry period. The 10‐day and 20‐day two‐average entry system has a profi t
peak of about $125. The 20‐day and 40‐day two‐average entry system has a
profi t peak of about $175, and the 40‐day and 80‐day two‐average entry sys-
tem has a profi t peak of about $400. Clearly this entry is more eff ective than
the single moving average system in Entry 1. There is one caveat, however:
The single moving average system had many more entries than the second
system (about 1.5 times as many).

Relative Strength Index (RSI)
This indicator was introduced by J. Welles Wilder Jr. in his classic book, N ew
Concepts in Technical Trading Systems. The algorithm determines the ratio of up
closes to down closes over a specifi ed number of bars. The output is normal-
ized to a value between 0 and 100. When used as trend‐following methods,
values higher than 50 are bullish, while values lower than 50 are bearish. In
this analysis, the trend‐following buy signal was a value of 53 or higher, and
the trend‐following sell signal was an RSI value of 47 or lower. Figure 4.4
shows the results.

There are good separation and persistence for all the entries in Figure 4.4 .
It looks like they all have an intermediate peak near 40 days after entry. Though
the graph is intended to visually present the power of the entry, it also shows
the spot where you hit diminishing returns. After 40 bars, I’d look to tighten
up the stop considerably expecting a profi t pullback.
Stochastic
This indicator is attributed to George Lane. Like the RSI indicator, the sto-
chastic number is normalized to values between 0 and 100. The number
shows the location of the current close relative to the high/low range of the
number of bars used in the analysis. The stochastic number can be smoothed

by averaging the last three values. Figure 4.5 shows the smoothed values.
For this analysis, the trend‐following buy signal occurs when the stochastic
value is close above 51 or greater, and the sell signal occurs when the sto-
chastic value penetrates below 49.

The lines in Figure 4.5 are more jagged than those in the RSI profi t
run‐up. I’ve never found a good use for stochastics, though in fairness to
the algorithm, it is generally used as a two‐value indicator: slow and fast
stochastic.
Rate of Change (ROC)
Rate of change (ROC) is an indicator that measures the velocity of price
change. Typically, today’s closing price is divided by the closing price some
number of bars ago and then multiplied by 100 to yield the measurement.
When the value is above 100, velocity is up; below 100, and velocity is
down. Figure 4.6 shows the power of this entry signal when long trades
are taken at an ROC of 102 or greater and short trades are taken at 98 or
below.
There is good separation on the lines in Figure 4.6 until about
50 days, when things start to become muddled. The intermediate peaks
though 50 days are less than the corresponding ones on the RSI chart
(Figure 4.4 ) .

Standard Deviation Breakouts
Breakout entries are those where price penetrates an upper or lower bound.
One such boundary is some number of standard deviations away from the
average price over some number of bars. Usually, the standard deviation is
computed across the closing prices of the bars. Figure 4.7 uses 10, 20, 40,
and 80 daily bars, and computes the breakout point as two standard devia-
tion measures away from the average.

Like the RSI graphs in Figure 4.4 , the lines in Figure 4.7 have the proper-
ties you want to see: clear separation and more power in the longer‐term
entries. A diff erence between this set of lines and those in the RSI graphs
is the defi nite turn‐down in profi t some number of days after entry in the
standard deviation graphs.
Donchian Entry
The Donchian entry was advocated by Richard Donchian in the 1960s
for stock trading. Later, it was the baseline entry for Richard Dennis and
William Eckhardt’s Turtle system. It is a breakout system with the upper
penetration point being the highest high, or close, of the last n bars. The
lower penetration point is the lowest low, or close, of the last n bars. This is
a very popular entry because of its notoriety and the fact that it works well
in almost all time frames. Because of its popularity, almost every entry will
have huge entry volume and corresponding slippage, or price pullback, for
a few days. For our entry, we’ll go long when price closes above the n‐bar
Donchian high and short when price closes below the n‐day Donchian low
where n is the number of bars used to determine the Donchian highs and
lows. Figure 4.8 shows Donchian entry power performance.
The set of lines in Figure 4.8 corresponds very closely to the standard
deviation graph of Figure 4.7 . It is my experience that those are the best two
well‐known entries.

Summary of Trend‐Following Entry Power
for Commodities
Using the entry power results on the handful of trend‐following entry tech-
niques presented here is a good starting point for system development. If
you’re interested in a comprehensive set of entries to test for yourself, I
highly recommend The Ultimate Trading Advantage by John Hill, George
Pruitt, and Lundy Hill. John and George run “Futures Truth,” which rates
the real‐time performance of developer‐submitted trading systems. They’ve
seen it all.
Though each entry uses the same number of bars, the graphs are not
strictly an apples‐to‐apples comparison because the number of entry sig-
nals created by each technique varies. Tables 4.1 through 4.4 show the peak
profit point, and the number of entries each entry generated over the 10-,
20-, 40-, and 80-bar periods, respectively. The third column is formed by
multiplying the peak profit point by the number of entries. That number
represents the total profit that would be available across all the entries if they
were held to the number of days corresponding to the peak profit point. The
last two columns show an alternate metric; the maximum profit‐per‐day
is found by dividing each point on the graphs by the number of days since
entry. It is a measure of the velocity of profit accumulation.

Lastly, with 80 bars, the Donchian, standard deviation, and RSI entries
look to be first, second, and third.
The bottom line is that these entries are tested, and used, by many, many
traders. A signal in a popular entry technique will lead to a flood of orders,
which increases slippage. If you can find something that competes in per-
formance with the Donchian, standard deviation, or RSI entries in any time
frame, you have a trading nugget. Build a tradeable system around it, and
you’ve got something you can use for years.
Next we’ll look at entries on daily‐bar stock market data.
■ Comparison of Common Counter-Trend Entry
Techniques on Daily-Bar Stock Data
In this section, we’ll look at the same entry techniques we explored for
commodities, but with two differences. First, we’ll only look to trade
stocks from the long side, and second, since stocks act in a counter‐trend
manner on daily bars, we will buy when the entry technique shows weak-
ness. Though we’ll only look to trade from the long side, we’ll watch for
shorting opportunities by remembering that if the long trades show a big
loss, doing the reverse and shorting those signals will lead to a profit on the
short trade. We will use 10, 20, 40, and 80 daily bars, as we did with the
commodity trend‐following entries. Instead of the dollars‐per‐contract

metric we used for commodities, this section will use a metric of percent
profi t‐per‐trade. In the last chapter, we saw that due to survivorship bias
our basket of 1,716 stocks has a slight up bias. For our entry analysis,
we’ll remove the bias in each trade by taking out the small average upward
movement each day.
Counter‐Trend‐Following Stock Entry
with a Single Moving Average
The counter‐trend entry with a single moving average is to buy when the
close crosses b elow the moving average. Figure 4.9 shows the average per-
cent gained across all trades from the entry day until 150 days later.

Figure 4.9 shows that stocks behave much diff erently than commodities.
With the commodities, performance generally adhered to the rule that the
more bars of information, the better the performance in terms of strength
of return and persistence of the profi t growth. This stock graph shows the
diffi culty of trading stocks in the longer term. The highest profi t on the
chart is at about 0.4 percent and 95 days. Since there are about 250 trading
days a year, there are a bit more than two and a half 95‐day cycles. A profi t
of 0.4 percent every 95 days annualizes to about 1 percent—defi nitely not
worth trading. Maybe this is just a poor setup for stocks. Let’s look at the
dual moving average system.

Counter‐Trend‐Following Stock Entry

There is defi nitely better separation with the dual moving average system.
The most interesting points look to be 1.06 percent profi t point that the
20/40 day entry has after 50 days of trading, and the 0.49 percent profi t that
the 40/80 day solution has at 33 days. Still, annualizing those returns only
yields 5.3 percent for the 20/40 solution and 3.7 percent for the 40/80
entry.
Counter‐Trend‐Following Stock Entry with RSI
The counter‐trend entry with RSI is to buy when the RSI value falls b elow a
threshold. For this analysis the threshold was 47. Figure 4 .11 shows the av-
erage percent gained across all trades from the entry day until 150 days later.
Figure 4.11 shows the 80‐day entry heading up to a gain of 0.19 percent
at three days and then straight down to a loss of 1.06 percent at 41 days.

Assuming you entered s hort on day four, that would yield a short trade gain
of 1.25 in 37 days, or an annualized yield of 8.4 percent—not tradeable on
its own, but anytime you fi nd something that makes money on the short side
in stocks it’s worth taking note. Those types of trades can be used as a hedge
to your long‐side‐only trading.
The only other thing of note in Figure 4.11 is the 0.19 percent gain on
the long side for the 80‐day entry. That annualizes to 16.7 percent, but of
course slippage and commission will take their toll on such a small gain.
Counter‐Trend‐Following Stock Entry
with Stochastics
The counter‐trend entry with stochastics is to buy when the three‐day
smoothed stochastic value crosses b elow a certain threshold. The threshold
used in this analysis was 49. Figure 4.12 shows the average percent gained
across all trades from the entry day until 150 days later.
Figure 4.12 looks more like the commodity graphs we saw in the previous
section than the stock graphs we’ve seen so far. In particular, they separate
after time and the longer term signals don’t fall well below the zero line. But
a diff erence from the commodity charts is that the best longer‐term results
aren’t the longer‐term signals; they are the short‐term signals. In any event,
the peaks occur too far after the signal to yield anything that might annualize
to a decent return.

this analysis was 100. Figure 4.13 shows the average percent gained across

As we saw with the RSI 80‐day entry signals in Figure 4.11 , the 80‐day
entry with standard deviation leads to short trades that accrue more than
1 percent of profi t many days after the signal, but they are not tradeable
on their own. On the long side, the 10‐day entry hits 0.35 percent of
profi t after nine days. That annualizes to about 9.7 percent a trade—still not
exciting.
Counter‐Trend‐Following Stock Entry with a
Donchian Entry
The counter‐trend entry using the Donchian technique is to buy when the
close crosses below the low close of the last n bars. Figure 4.15 shows the
average percent gained across all trades from the entry day until 150 days

Finally there’s something that may be worthwhile. Within the fi rst
10 days after entry all four signals jump to a profi t, then pull back. The
following is a breakout by signal of the most interesting points and their
annualized return:
10‐day signal:
■
0.29 percent profi t after fi ve days is a 14.5 percent annualized return.
■
0.34 percent profi t after six days is a 14.2 percent annualized return.
■
0.37 percent profi t after nine days is a 10.3 percent annualized return.

20‐day signal:
■
0.27 percent profi t after six days is an 11.2 percent annualized return.
■
40‐day signal:
■
0.24 percent profi t after fi ve days is a 12.0 percent annualized return.
■
80‐day signal:
■
0.28 percent profi t after three days is a 23.3 percent annualized return.
■
0.39 percent profi t after fi ve days is a 19.5 percent annualized return.
■
From this breakout, it appears that the 10‐day and 80‐day are the best
candidates.

Counter‐Trend‐Following Stock‐Entry Note
Obviously the preceding analysis was not exhaustive. With an entry candi-
date, more work should be done before system development starts with that
entry. For instance, the RSI, ROC, stochastic, and standard deviation entries
are made at levels below normal; these would be varied. And because of
the value of finding even moderately performing short signals, more work
should be done on those entries that could potentially yield them. Lastly,
remember that the graphs had a positive survivorship bias that was removed.
In the later years that bias was much less because the stock basket is much
closer to the 100 percent real basket that traded at the time. I’d go back and
check performance for the last few years for interesting signals without the
bias removal to see how good the signal really is.
Counter‐Trend‐Following Stock Entry
Observations
There are clear differences between the commodity and stock graphs:
The commodity graphs have a clear separation of the n‐day length lines
■
and they vary right from the start, where the stock 10‐, 20‐, and 40‐day
lines have very little spread. The 80‐day stock lines head straight down
from the start.
The commodity graphs have a relatively higher average profit‐per‐trade
■
as the number of bars increases from 10 to 80. The stock graphs gener-
ally have their worst average percent profit using 80 days of data. In most
cases the best results use 10 bars.
■ Conclusion
In this chapter we explored the entry power of well‐known entry setups.
The methodology was to use a large basket of a tradeable and generate entry
signals using the setup with a spectrum of look‐back bars of information.
After the entry signal, the profit was accrued across all signals out to some
number of days and the results graphed. From the graphs, significant peak
points can be seen and the annualized return computed. Thus entry power is
represented graphically, and by annualized return.

For commodities, the RSI, standard deviation, and Donchian entries
looked most interesting. For stocks, the Donchian entry was far and away
the best. But a cautionary note: The analysis was not exhaustive, only il-
lustrative. If you have an entry idea, this is the type of analysis you should
do to find out if it’s worthwhile and in what time frames it works best. In
the next two chapters we will build a commodity and stock system on the
Donchian entry.

CHAPTER 5
Trading System
Elements: Exits
T
he optimum time to exit a trade is at the peak profit point of the trade.
Finding that point is easier said than done, and I’ve never seen anybody
actually try to build a measure of whether today’s the peak profit day or not.
In reality, most developers exit trades in one of four ways: through a reversal
signal, through a stop loss, through a time‐based exit, or through a profit 65
stop. Examples of each will be shown in this chapter using a stock strategy
and a commodity strategy.
For this analysis, we’ll use the stocks that comprised the Nasdaq 100 at
the end of 2011 with daily‐bar data going back to 2000, if they traded that
long. On the commodity side, we’ll use a basket of 56 commodities with
data from 1980 to the end of 2011. Back‐adjusted stock and commodity
contacts will be used, and, unless otherwise noted, transaction costs (slip-
page and commission) will not be included.
The baseline entry signal for both stocks and commodities will be the
Donchian entry described in Chapter 4. In keeping with the trending ten-
dencies of the two classes of trading instruments, we will use a counter‐
trend Donchian entry for stocks and a trend‐following Donchian entry for
commodities. For stocks, we’ll initiate a $5,000 position at each long or
short signal, and for commodities we’ll buy or sell one contract.

■ Reversal Exit Signals (Stock Example)
A reversal signal exit occurs in an always‐in‐the‐market system like the
moving average system we tested in Chapter 4. The exit for the current
position is also the entry for the reverse position. Sometimes starting the
system development process with an entry idea and using a reversal sys-
tem to find the best parameter set for the long and short entry, while
alternately reversing from long to short and back to long again, leads to a
good strategy.
The trending tendency analysis in Chapter 4 indicated that a counter‐
trend Donchian entry is a good candidate for a stock trading system entry.
The entry/exit rules for the stock reversal system are:
Exit the short position and go long on the next open when there is a close
below the n‐day look‐back lowest close.
Exit the long position and go short on the next open when there is a close
above the n‐day look‐back highest close.
Using the 100‐stock basket, the look‐back period for the entry was var-
ied from 10 to 80 days, in steps of 10, to get a feel for where the best trading
point might lie. Both long and short trades were taken. Table 5.1 shows the
results for each look‐back length.
TABLE 5.1 Stock Trade Stats by Look‐back in Days
Look‐Back in Days Winning Trades Losing Trades Total Profit ($) Profit‐per‐Trade ($)
10 11,603 6,410 245,422 13
20 5,806 3,232 95,625 10
30 3,832 2,126 –67,307 –12
By the time a 30‐day look‐back was hit, it was evident that the only
way to trade this entry was short‐term, so longer look‐backs weren’t
tested. This behavior matches my development experience: It’s hard
to find good longer‐term trading solutions for stocks using technical
analysis.
Here’s a further breakout of the run with a 10‐day look‐back:
Long winning trades: 6,248
Long losing trades: 2,779
Long total profit: $629,586
Long profit‐per‐trade: $69

SYSTEM
ELEMENTS:
EXITS
Short winning trades: 5,355
Short losing trades: 3,631
Short total profit: –$384,147
Short profit‐per‐trade: –$43
It’s obvious that the short side is what’s holding this strategy back.
On average, every short trade is a $43 loser. Some may wonder how
the short side can have a winning percentage of 60 percent and lose
money. This is a good example of how counter‐trend trading usually
works. You’re trying to buy when oversold, and cover and reverse to
short when overbought. The range between oversold and overbought
depends on how many days of data your setup uses. We’re using 10 days,
so the distance between oversold and overbought is relatively small. That
means small profits when you’re right. But a stock can stay oversold all
the way down to zero, or remain overbought all the way to the moon.
That means large losses when you’re wrong. In this case, the short‐side
average winner was $258 while the average loser was $498. The fact that
the short side performs so poorly again lines up with my development
experience: It’s very hard to find stock strategies that perform well on
the short side.
Based on the results, let’s make the strategy a long‐only strategy. We’ll
still use the Donchian entry point for the short side, but instead of using
it to close the long and enter short, the logic will be to just close out the
long trade and wait for a new long setup. We know that the long‐only
strategy makes $69 per trade using the 10‐day entry. Is 10 days the best
short‐term entry? Table 5.2 shows summary data when the look‐back pe-
riod is varied from 20 days down to two days in two‐day increments.
This table introduces a gain‐to‐pain metric that we’ll use from here on
out. The metric is a ratio formed by dividing the average annual return
(the gain) by the average annual max draw‐down (the pain you have to
experience to get your gain). The average annual max draw‐down figure
is found by finding the x largest draw‐downs over the trading period and
averaging the results. The x value is the number of years spanning the trad-
ing period. In our case, the time period is 2000 through the end of 2011.
That’s 12 years. The total profit is divided by 12 to form the numerator
of the ratio, and the 12 largest draw‐downs are found and averaged to
form the denominator, even if more than one of the largest draw‐downs
occurred in the same year.

2 24 79,553 64,319 102,895 1.24
In general, as the look‐back is decreased from 20 days down to two, these
are the trends:
Profit‐per‐trade decreases.
■
Annual return increases.
■
Average max draw‐down decreases.
■
Max draw‐down decreases.
■
Gain‐to‐pain increases.
■
Those are all good tendencies, except for the profit‐per‐trade trend. If
using a look‐back of two looks like the solution we should pick, you might
have fallen into the trap this sort of analysis can set.
The problems are the average profit‐per‐trade and the realities of transac-
tion costs: The average profit‐per‐trade is so low that transaction costs will
substantially eat into them. If you use a low commission broker like Interac-
tive Brokers, your round‐turn commission for the average $5,000 position
will probably be about $4, so your $24 a trade is down to $20 right off the
bat. The market orders that are filled on the open for both entry and exit
add to that toll. I believe the slippage you’ll get on those orders will average
about $0.015 per share. If the average price of a share across all entries and
exits is $20, the 3 cents of slippage for the market orders is 0.15 percent.
The $20 per trade we’re making on each $5,000 position is 0.40 percent a
trade. Subtracting the slippage percent from 0.40 percent, we wind up mak-
ing 0.25 percent per trade, which is $12.50 per trade on our $5,000 posi-
tions after transaction costs. Our $24 per trade number has been halved.

SYSTEM

My selection from Table 5.2 would be the 8‐day look‐back. Even with the
$4 commission and $0.03 of slippage for the two market orders, the $62 per
trade is only reduced to about $50.50 per trade. That’s more than 1 percent
of our $5,000 bet‐size. We should net about that number in real trading.
■ Exit Stops (Stock Example)
An exit stop can be a catastrophic stop, or a trailing stop. I’ve found that a trail-
ing stop is usually only effective on longer‐term systems as a way to signal that
the trend is definitely over. I do use a catastrophic stop in almost all the com-
modity systems I’ve traded. It is the “uncle” point of the trade. For intra‐day
commodity or FX systems, it might be $500 away from the entry point. For
longer‐term systems, it might be thousands of dollars away from the entry. If
that point is hit, admit that the entry was bad, exit, and wait for a new setup.
Using the eight‐bar look‐back Donchian entry, long‐only strategy as a
baseline, let’s look at a range of catastrophic stop levels. The stop is triggered
when closing price brings the position to a loss greater than the dollar stop
level selected. If the close is below the stop price, exit is done on the next
open. Table 5.3 shows results for a range of catastrophic dollar‐stop levels.

* Baseline
The stop triggered on the close for execution on the open did improve re-
sults for stop levels of $1,000 and below, but the cost of implementing one of
those stops is a fairly large drop‐off in profit‐per‐trade. Of note is the fact that
a $3,000 stop changed the statistics of the trading solution from the baseline,
meaning that some trades hit that stop trigger.Y ou need about 50 of the $62 win-
ners to recapture a $3,000 loss. Again this shows the tendency of counter‐trend

trading: Losses can be quite large. Let’s look at exiting on the close instead of
the next open if the stop is triggered on the close. Table 5.4 shows the results.

Catastrophic Average Profit‐ Average Annual Average Annual Max Draw‐ Gain‐to‐Pain

$500 43 44,503 46,612 120,626 0.95
* Baseline
Again, the catastrophic stop triggered on the close and exited on the close
only helps the trading solution for stop levels of $1,000 and below and,
again, at a significant penalty in profit‐per‐trade from the baseline. It’s not
surprising that the exit on the following open somewhat outperforms the
exit on the close of the day that the stop is hit. When a stop is triggered, it
has to have been a down day for that stock. As stocks trade in a counter‐
trend manner, you’d expect a bounce on the next open.
Lastly, let’s look at exiting with the catastrophic stop intra‐day. Table 5.5
shows the results.

of the catastrophic stop, it’s clear that the exit on the next open is the best
way to go.
I went through all three versions of the catastrophic stop for a reason. I
think these tables illustrate the following points:
A stop loss doesn’t increase your profit‐per‐trade. Many think that a stop elimi-
■
nates a large portion of the loss of the big losers and that should lead to
an overall greater profit. They do cap the loss on the big losers, but a lot
of trades that would have been winners or small losers will hit the stop,
get taken out of play, and then any rebound from the stop point won’t be
seen. The net result isn’t an increase in profit‐per‐trade. In fact, usually
profit‐per‐trade goes down. Don’t think this means that I don’t advocate
stops. When they help improve the trading solution I use them. In fact,
I’ve never traded a futures strategy without some sort of stop. On the
other hand, I’ve never traded a stock strategy with a catastrophic stop.
Now, if a stock strategy risked all the account equity on each trade like
some do when trading exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like the Power-
shares QQQ (QQQ), then some sort of catastrophic stop would prob-
ably be warranted. But when you’re trading a basket of stocks with a
short‐term scalping strategy such as this one, the risk to the portfolio
from each trade is just not that great. Still, it always pays to look at them
early in the development.
A stop loss doesn’t increase your total profit. Hand‐in‐hand with the profit‐per‐
■
trade conclusion is the fact that it is rare that a catastrophic stop increases
overall strategy profitability. Again, this doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be
used. If the tradeoff between decreasing risk and decreasing profitability
is worth it, the stop should be used.
A catastrophic stop is a risk‐avoidance measure. As you look at the three tables
■
(5.3–5.5) you’ll see that the average max draw‐down and max draw‐
down numbers decrease with smaller and smaller catastrophic stops. This
is the purpose of stops: risk control.
An in‐the‐market stop is not necessarily the best form of risk control. I rarely
■
use in‐the‐market stops—not because I’m against them, but be-
cause the results of my development analysis show that the best risk/
reward solution usually lies with a stop executed at either the close
or the next open. This doesn’t even take into account the argument
about “stop hunting,” which many traders consider a huge problem
with in‐the‐market stops. Those traders believe strong hands move the

market to pick off resting stops for their own purposes. I don’t know
if that’s true or not, but I do know that if you have a resting stop in the
overnight session of a commodity market, strange things can happen.
Regarding trailing stops, I made some runs on this strategy using varia-
tions of trailing stops and didn’t find anything that improved the trading
solution. Later in this chapter, we’ll be developing a commodity strategy.
Trailing stops will be detailed then. For now, let’s leave our baseline stock
strategy without a catastrophic stop.
■ Time-Based Exits (Stock Example)
A time‐of‐day stop can be used by a day trader to exit at or near the market
close, by an intermediate‐term trader who doesn’t want to hold over the
weekend, or by a trader who thinks his setup has had enough time to work
and wants to put the money to work on another trade. The last case is very
interesting because the power of the entry graphs in Chapter 4 show us that
an x‐bar entry setup starts to lose steam at a certain point. That would be an
excellent time to exit the trade if it’s survived to that point.
Let’s take our baseline Donchian stock strategy and look at exiting a trade
after a certain number of days. Runs were made exiting on the close of the
xth day and at the open after the xth day. The open exit on the following day
was slightly better. Table 5.6 reflects that exit.

The eight‐day exit looks the best from the gain‐to‐pain ratio perspective.
Its average annual return is larger than its average max draw‐down and the
max draw‐down over $50,000 less than the baseline, but it comes at a cost

of giving up $15 a trade from the baseline. I think the draw‐down improve-
ments are worth the loss of profit‐per‐trade, so that exit will become the
new baseline.
■ Profit Stops (Stock Example)
The profit stop is an exit strategy that is always worth looking at. It violates
the rule to let your profits run, but it gets you out of the trade at an equity
high to that point. In that regard, it eliminates open trade equity retrace-
ment, which is a form of draw‐down. Even if the average profit‐per‐trade
is reduced by using a profit target, it may still be worthwhile to incorporate
one because of reduced draw‐down. Table 5.7 shows the results of incorpo-
rating a profit stop into the baseline. The profit stop is triggered if the dol-
lar level is exceeded intra‐day so a sell limit order is used for the exit. It is
placed at the entry in points plus the stop value in dollars divided by $5,000.

$100 39 64,714 38,916 74,525 1.66
* Baseline
** New Baseline
As you can see, the profit stop really improves the strategy without any
tradeoffs; the profit‐per‐trade actually goes up until a profit target of $300 is
hit. If you’re wondering how total profit can go up, it’s because of increased
trading opportunities. When we exit with a profit target, we are exiting be-
fore eight trading days have elapsed (the time stop in the last section). This
gives opportunities for new trades in that symbol, which obviously occur.
Profit targets are effective exits with scalping strategies like this for a
couple of reasons. First, you’re buying oversold and looking to exit at over-
bought, but the distance between oversold and oversold isn’t that great. The
profit target allows you to get any kind of bounce with the exit limit order.

Additionally, when you’re scalping, slippage is also a major issue. Any stop
or market order that you can replace with a limit order will reduce slippage.
There are other forms of profi t‐taking, as we will see next when we start
the development of our commodity system. Before we start the commodity
strategy, Figure 5 .1 shows an equity curve of the stock system to this point.

FIGURE 5.1 Equity Curve of Stock Strategy
We’ve all seen better‐looking equity curves, but there’s really only one
disaster point, and that’s the bloodbath in 2008. But even then, the strategy
managed to eke out a profi t for the year.

A nice stat here is that there are no losing years. If you traded this strategy
with $500,000, you’d average about 14 percent return‐per‐year, experience
about 10 percent max draw‐down each year, and have a max draw‐down of
about 19 percent once in the 12‐year period. Not quite our trading objec-
tives, but we’re getting there.
■ Reversal Exit Signals (Commodity Example)
We’ve selected a trend‐following Donchian entry as our baseline entry for
the commodity system. The following are the trend‐following entry rules:
Long entry: If flat or short, and trading exceeds the highest close of the
previous x days, then exit the short position and go long. Entry is on a
stop order.
Short entry: If flat or long, and trading goes below the lowest close of the
previous x days, then exit the long position and go short. Entry is on
a stop order.
Table 5.9 shows the results of reversal trading using a number of look‐
back periods. Again, we’re using a 56‐commodity basket with data from
1980 until the end of 2011, and no transaction costs have been included.

A look‐back of 20 days will form our entry baseline for the commodity
strategy. Other pertinent information from that run was:
Long wining trades: 2,716 Short wining trades: 2,451
Long losing trades: 3,982 Short losing trades: 4,218
Long total profit: $3,719,788 Short total profit: $1,463,458
Long average profit per trade: $555 Short average profit per trade: $219
These statistics are pretty representative of mid‐ to longer‐term trend‐
following strategies:
Winning percentage of trades is less than 50 percent. In this case it’s
■
about 39 percent.
Profit‐per‐trade increases with the number of bars used for the setup.
■
Long‐side trades have much better statistics than short‐side trades.
■
Profit‐per‐trade is so large that transaction costs will cause only a small
■
performance drop‐off.
What the statistics don’t show is the biggest wart of trend‐following:
open‐equity give‐back. Trend‐followers cut losses and let the profits run.
The problem is figuring out when the run is over. I had a trend‐following
palladium trade in 1999 that grew to an open equity profit of over $30,000
a contract. I got only about $20,000 out of the trade. I gave back about
$10,000 of open equity profit. Anything you can do in your development to
keep as much of the peak equity of the move is a good thing to do for two
reasons: First, you’ll realize more profit, but second, and more importantly,
you’ll reduce draw‐down due to the give‐back.
Let’s see if catastrophic stops, time‐based stops, and profit‐target stops
can reign in the huge draw‐downs and make this strategy tradeable.
■ Exit Stops (Commodity Example)
In this section we’ll take a more detailed look at exit stops with the com-
modity reversal baseline. In addition to dollar‐based catastrophic stops,
some volatility‐based stops will be examined.
Catastrophic Stops
For our stock example, we only looked at a catastrophic stop that was
dollar‐based: a stop some number of dollars away from the entry. With

scalping systems you can’t get too fancy, because you’re only playing with
a margin of a couple of hundred dollars. When you develop longer‐term
trend‐following systems, it pays to thoroughly look at a number of different
candidates. That’s because some trades will net many thousands of dollars.
Cutting a few of those off prematurely with a haphazard stop can make a big
bottom‐line performance difference. In this section we’ll look at three dif-
ferent catastrophic stops.
The first catastrophic stop we’ll test is a dollar stop; for long trades a
fixed stop will be placed x dollars below the entry, and for short trades, it
will be placed above the entry price. When the stop level is penetrated on a
close, exit will be done on the next open. Table 5.10 shows the results.

Table 5.10 illustrates the major challenge in developing good mid‐ to
longer‐term trend‐following strategies: It’s difficult to control the risk (in
terms of draw‐down and individual trade risk). Even with a stop $5,000
away from the entry point, draw‐down is not curtailed. You just can’t trade
a $10,000 to $20,000 account using stops that large. If the first trade is
stopped out, your account will be down 25 to 50 percent. Moreover, the
$5,000 stop is really only effective for the more volatile commodities. The
following is a breakout by commodity group showing the percentage of
the trades that hit the $5,000 stop.
Grains: 0 U.S. financials: 0
Meats: 0 Foreign financials: <1
Softs: <1 Foreign stock: 5.0
Metals: 1.8 U.S. stock: <1
Energies: <1
Currencies: <1

The breakout shows that only the metals and foreign stock indices are
affected by the $5,000. For the rest of the groups, it really doesn’t provide
much protection.
The deficiencies of the dollar‐based stop cause us to look at tailoring the stop
to some measure of the recent volatility of the commodity. This has two advant-
ages. First, every commodity goes through periods ranging from near‐dormant
to near‐ballistic; a stop should adjust to this difference. Second, some commodi-
ties are more volatile than others even when they are near‐dormant and the
other is near‐ballistic, the DAX futures index and oats are examples. Why not
have a catastrophic stop that adjusts to the current volatility of the commodity?
There are two commonly used volatility measures: average daily range,
or true range, and the standard deviation of closing price over some period.
Sometimes, the entry setup also provides a measure of the recent volatility.
That is the case with the Donchian entry. The distance between the n‐day
look‐back’s high and low triggers really pinpoints the relative movement of
the commodity over the last n days. We’ll now look at all three.
Table 5.11 shows the reversal baseline, and the reversal baseline with a
catastrophic stop variation based on the Donchian entry. The variation is
called midpoint, and it is the average of the long Donchian entry point and
the short Donchian entry point on the day of trade entry.

The midpoint stop is too tight. It chokes off a lot of profitable trades
early, resulting in a $70 drop‐off in profit‐per‐trade, and it doesn’t help the
draw‐down situation.

Table 5.12 shows results when a standard deviation catastrophic stop is
used. Since the Donchian entry points are found over the last 20 bars, we’ll
use the last 20 closes to compute the standard deviation.
Table 5.12 shows that with a stop placed three standard deviations
away from our entry, the gain‐to‐pain ratio is increased to 1.14 from
the baseline of 1.12. Let’s see if the average range stop can improve
on that.
Table 5.13 shows results when an average range catastrophic stop is used.
The average range is found over the 20 days immediately preceding the
signal. Again, the Donchian entry points are found from those same bars of
information.

The best the average range stop could do was tie the baseline gain‐to‐pain
ratio of 1.12.
The best catastrophic stop was the three‐standard-deviation stop. It seems
like that might be very large when converted to dollars, so another run was
made to find the average dollar value of the stop. It was $1,910. That’s still
large, especially for smaller accounts, but for now let’s keep it as the new
baseline and move forward in the development. We can come back to it
later, if needed.
Trailing Stops
The trick to a good trailing stop on a mid‐ to longer‐term trend‐following
strategy is to ratchet up the acceleration of the stop as the trade starts to go
parabolic. Figure 5.2 shows the thought.

80
STIXE
:STNEMELE

Time
Fixed moving averages don’t react fast enough as the trade starts to ac-
celerate in profi t so your open equity give‐back is large. In this section we’ll
look at three sets of logic that try to mimic the ideal trailing stop. The fi rst
has been around in the open literature since 1978.
J. Welles Wilder Jr., in his groundbreaking book, New Concepts in Technical
Trading Systems, introduced a number of innovative concepts like relative
strength index (RSI) and average directional movement index (ADX).
Often overlooked is his Parabolic Time/Price System. Though he used it as
a reversal system, I think it’s best used as a trailing stop. If a long trade is
initiated, an initial stop is placed, and every day thereafter that stop moves
up at an ever‐increasing rate, whether the position is advancing in profi t
or not. The ever‐increasing rate is a function of the acceleration factor. In
Wilder’s book, an acceleration factor of 0.02 was used, and that number was
increased by 0.02 every time the trade had a profi table day. But the number
really depends on the type of trading you’re doing. With short‐term systems
the factor will be relatively large, and as the holding period goes longer, the
acceleration factor needs to decrease.
The acceleration factor is used to tighten the stop by adding an ever‐increas-
ing increment to the existing stop. The increment is computed by multiplying
the existing acceleration factor by the diff erence of the existing stop and the
high‐water point of the trade. An example will clear things up. Suppose you go
long and your initial stop is three standard deviations below your entry price (as
we’re doing with our catastrophic commodity stop). If your entry price is 100
and your initial stop is 85, the trade might start to play out as in Table 5 .14.

As profit accrues, you can see the stop tightens at an ever‐increasing rate.

* Baseline
The published acceleration factor of 0.02 is much too fast for this strategy.
It cuts off over $150 of profit‐per‐trade and doesn’t help the draw‐down
stats. Let’s try a different trailing stop strategy.
A trailing stop I developed, and used in one of my commercially sold
trading systems, accelerated the stop by going to shorter‐length moving
average trailing stops at certain profit increments. You want to start with
a moving average that’s far enough away from the entry price so you
don’t prematurely take out a trade and then, when appreciable profit
accrues, move to a shorter‐length moving average. The appreciable profit
can be any metric, but I used standard deviation. Since we’re using
20 bars of data for entry, I’ll use the standard deviation of the closes on
the day of entry as the target. When there is a close above entry price
plus the standard deviation level, the trailing stop moves to a shorter‐
length moving average.
Table 5.16 shows the results for a number of moving average combina-
tions. I didn’t exhaustively test, but just wanted to demonstrate that trailing
stops can be effective.

These results show that this approach to an accelerating stop can improve
results. Though the gain‐to‐pain is only marginally improved to 1.15 in the
bottom‐row case, the max draw‐down is significantly reduced in every case.
Let’s not take the bottom row as the new baseline. It gives up a lot of profit‐
per‐trade for the draw‐down reduction. We can come back and incorporate
it if the rest of the development doesn’t solve the draw‐down problem.
■ Time-Based Exits (Commodity Example)
In our stock system development this chapter, we saw a big improvement in
baseline performance when we capped the trade length at eight days. Let’s
see if the same exit logic will work for the commodity system. Table 5.17
shows results when we exit a position after a certain holding period in days.

There is a marginal increase in gain‐to‐pain when the number of days for
exit is 80, but that solution hardly impacts the draw‐down problem. This is
pretty typical of mid‐ to longer‐term trend‐following. There just isn’t a time

Maybe a profit target of some sort will cut back risk. We know that a profit‐
target exit occurs at the peak profit point of the trade up to that point, so
there won’t be any open equity give‐back on those trades. Maybe that will
be enough to limit draw‐down, especially the $470,000 max draw‐down
that makes this strategy a non‐starter.
First we’ll try a dollar‐based profit stop. If there is a close that puts the
trade in profit by x dollars, we’ll exit the trade on the next open. Table 5.18
shows the results when the dollar‐based profit target is varied from $4,000
to $15,000.

* Baseline
The dollar‐based profit target didn’t help. In fact, the max draw‐downs
got worse.
Let’s try a volatility‐based profit target. We saw that a volatility‐based
catastrophic stop worked for the commodity system because the risk was
tailored to the recent volatility of the commodity; maybe a volatility‐based
profit stop will work as well. A volatility‐based profit stop that I’ve used
successfully in the past counts the number of standard deviation moves of
profit a trade makes. When the count hits the exit number, exit is done on
the next open. Since we’re using 20 days of data for the Donchian entry, let’s
use the last 20 days’ close to compute the standard deviation. When a long
trade is signaled, the first target is the entry point plus the one standard de-
viation value on that day. If that value is surpassed, a second target is formed
by adding the standard deviation value on the day the target is passed to the

84

close for that day. After x targets are hit, the trade is exited. Note that we’re
adjusting the size of each target by the prevailing standard deviation on the
day of the adjustment, not with the standard deviation value that existed on
the day the trade was entered. Normally, as a successful trade progresses,
the volatility increases as the trade approaches and then goes parabolic. The
increased volatility is accounted for in our profi t target adjustments.
Table 5.19 shows the results as the number of the count is varied.

Table 5.19 shows that we only get a marginal increase in the gain‐to‐pain
metric with standard deviation counts of 8 through 10. And again, the max
draw‐down is not curtailed.
I tried a few more profi t‐stop mechanizations, but nothing took a signifi -
cant bite out of draw‐down. Maybe the fi lters we test in the next chapter
can do the trick.

■ Conclusion
In this chapter we started the development of two trading strategies, one for
stocks and one for commodities. Both used a Donchian entry, but the stock
entry was counter‐trend while the commodity strategy was trend‐following.
To this point, we’ve conditionally developed the strategies from entry
through exit. In the next chapter, we’ll look at adding filters to try and make
the strategies tradeable.

CHAPTER 6
Trading System
Elements: Filters
I
n general, filters are used in conjunction with the entry to eliminate
certain trades from being taken. When volatility in the S&P was high in
the late 1990s, it was common to employ a filter to avoid going long on a
Friday or short on a Monday. The rationale was that many traders didn’t
want to risk being long over the weekend so they exited on Friday. That 89
caused the market to go down on that day more often any other day of the
week. Conversely, the money would flow back in on Monday so it had an
up bias. Those are trading-day-of-the-week type filters.
Other common filters are seasonal, volatility, and longer‐term trend.
Seasonal filters use the seasonal tendencies of an instrument to avoid trading
against historical bias. Many traders won’t short reformulated gas going into
the driving season, or short heating oil going into winter. For stocks, forms
of a seasonal filter would be to avoid entering on a report day or an earnings
day. Volatility filters are useful for keeping you out of an instrument that
is going parabolic, or one whose trading range is so volatile that your stop
is likely to be hit by the normal noise of its day‐to‐day moves. There’s big
profit potential in those situations, but also abnormal risk. The longer‐term
trend filter is useful as an adjunct to a shorter-term system: You only take the
trades in the direction of the longer‐term trend.
I use filters in almost all my systems. Some are intended to enhance prof-
itability, and some are strictly meant to avoid risk. First we’ll develop filters
for the stock system; then we’ll look at improving the commodity system.

■ Trading-day-of-the-week Filter (Stocks)
Let’s see if avoiding stock entry on a particular day of the week helps base-
line performance. Table 6.1 shows the performance of the baseline we carry
over from last chapter. Added to that is logic that prohibits entry on the day
indicated.
TABLE 6.1 Day of the Week Filters with Stocks
Entry Average Profit‐ Average Annual Average Annual Max Draw‐ Gain‐to‐Pain
Prohibited per‐Trade ($) Return ($) Draw‐Down ($) Down ($) Ratio
None* 50 70,877 50,693 92,510 1.40

Friday 53 70,020 46,779 87,027 1.50
* Baseline
It looks like the best entries are early in the week; if we skip trading on
either Monday or Tuesday, the stats drop off. Later in the week, the stats get
better if entries are bypassed, but no day has such a large impact on trading
that it should receive special consideration as an addition to the baseline
system.
There’s one other trading-day-of-the-week type filter that’s always worth
looking at with stocks, and that’s the periods around the end of the quarter
and the start of the month. The rationale is that money managers perform
window dressing on their portfolios at those times.
When the trades initiated on the last day of the month and those on the
first day of the month were compared with baseline performance, the profit
was identical: $50 per trade. Those days are just like any other with this
strategy.
■ Longer-Term Trend Filter (Stocks)
Our long‐only stock strategy enters on weakness when there is a close
below the lowest close of the preceding eight trading days. Those trades can
occur when the longer‐term trend is either up or down. Let’s look at only
taking trades that set up when the longer‐term trend is up. An easy way
to define the longer‐term trend is to compare today’s closing price with

91

price some number of days ago. If price today is higher, the trend is up.
Table 6.2 shows our baseline when the longer‐term trend ranges from 30 to
90 bars ago.

* Baseline
** New baseline
Trading with the longer‐term trend causes performance to jump, as mea-
sured by our gain‐to‐pain metric. Note that the new baseline almost meets
the minimum conditions for a tradeable system if we use the 70‐day look‐
back filter.
Average profit‐per‐year is almost as large as the max draw‐down.
■
If you trade the strategy with $200,000, your max draw‐down will be
■
about 21 percent.
If you trade the strategy with $200,000, your average annual return will
■
be about 20 percent, and the average max draw‐down you will see each
year is about 10.5 percent.
■ Volatility-Based Filters (Stocks)
I always check performance with two forms of volatility filter. Your entry
setup can occur in a sleepy, almost sideways market, or in a very volatile up
and down market. In the first case, your profitability potential is reduced
from a normal setup. You are taking the risk of entering the trade, but your
profit potential isn’t that good unless the market heats up quickly, and in
the direction of the trade. To filter out those lesser‐profit potential trades,
the first filter only accepts trades that meet a certain threshold volatility;

92
SRETLIF
:STNEMELE
METSYS
GNIDART
that’s the low‐volatility filter. When volatility is way above normal, you have
an increased probability of getting stopped out due to higher up and down
market noise. The high‐volatility filter bypasses trade entry when volatility
is too high. There are a number of ways to measure volatility, like average
range, average true range, or some measure of standard deviation. We’ll test
both range and standard deviation. Table 6.3 shows results when trades are
inhibited by the low‐volatility filter because recent average range wasn’t a
large enough percentage of price. The average range was computed over the
five days previous to the entry.
TABLE 6.3 Low‐Volatility Filter Based on Average Range for Stocks
Average Range Greater Average Profit‐ Average Annual Average Annual Max Draw‐ Gain‐to‐
than x Percent of Price per‐Trade ($) Return ($) Draw‐Down ($) Down ($) Pain Ratio

3 67 26,670 15,757 23,047 1.69
* Baseline
The low‐volatility filter did increase profit‐per‐trade by screening out
trades that just didn’t have good profit potential, but gain‐to‐pain was de-
creased, so this filter won’t be added. Let’s look at the high‐volatility filter
using average range. Table 6.4 shows trade statistics.

5 47 30,201 18,114 40,327 1.67
* Baseline
The high‐volatility filter did screen out higher‐volatility stocks, as
seen by reduced profit‐per‐trade and reduced average max draw‐down,
but profitability came down faster than draw‐down, so the gain‐to‐pain
metric decreased. Maybe standard deviation volatility filters will be more
successful.

** New baseline
Taking signals that only have a standard deviation of closing price that is
greater than 3 percent of price increases profit‐per‐trade while decreasing
average max draw‐down and max draw‐down. Note that the new baseline
stock strategy is now tradeable.
The average annual return is greater than the max draw‐down. If
traded with $100,000, the return would average about 24 percent per
year, the max draw‐down over the past 12 years would have been about
17 percent, and the max draw‐down you could expect each year was
about 11.5 percent.
Let’s see if the standard deviation high‐volatility filter can make things
even better. Table 6.6 shows results when trades are bypassed that have a
standard deviation that is greater than x percent of price.

Note that the ugly 2008 draw‐down we saw in the stock system equity
curve from Chapter 5 is gone. This is primarily due to the addition of the
70‐day longer‐term fi lter. When the market plummeted in 2008, that fi lter
kept us out of most of the long trades. Table 6.7 is a year‐by‐year breakout
of return and draw‐down.

There was only one losing year (2008), and that year would have been
about a 10 percent loss on a $100,000 account—not too bad when you
consider that the S&P was down over 38 percent that year. Table 6.8 shows

Scanning the results, only eight of the 100 didn’t make money, and 37
averaged more than $100 a trade. Let’s now further the development of the
commodity strategy.
■ Trading-Day-of-the-Week Filter
(Commodities)
There’s a powerful trading-day-of-the-week type filter that I use in almost all
my mid‐ to longer‐term commodity trend‐following strategies. It’s a pullback
filter. If the long setup exists, we wait for price to go down one day, and if the
setup still exists, we enter the long position. For shorts, we wait for price to
rally for one day. Most trend‐following long signals occur on an up close. The
logic of this filter is to try to get a better price by waiting for a down close.
Beyond that, this filter eliminates a lot of false entries, entries that occur at the
top of the move, then go straight down to your catastrophic stop.

98
SRETLIF

To illustrate, a run was made on the 56‐commodity basket and, whenever
today’s close was less than yesterday’s, a long trade was taken on the next
open and exited on the open after that; reverse rules for shorts. The results
are shown in Table 6.9.
TABLE 6.9 Long‐ and Short‐Trade Breakout for Trading-Day-of-the-Week Filter
Winners Losers Profit ($) Profit‐per‐Trade ($)
Long Trades 103,423 96,495 3,907,148 19
Short Trades 103,743 104,504 1,660,935 7
Not bad. The addition of the filter would probably come close to cover-
ing transaction costs for the entry. Let’s look at what happens when we only
execute the long or short pullback filter when it is in the direction of the
trend. Since we’re using a 20‐day Donchian entry, we’ll use a 20‐day trend
look‐back filter. If today’s close is higher than it was 20 days ago, then
the longer‐term trend is up and we enter the one‐day trades every time
there’s a down close. Reverse logic for shorts. The results are shown in
Table 6.10.

Winners Losers Profit ($) Profit‐per‐Trade ($)
Long Trades 47,582 42,862 3,270,100 36
Short Trades 42,660 41,707 1,834,168 21
That filter addition would cover the transaction costs of the whole
trade—definitely worthwhile if the other stats aren’t impacted. Let’s try it
with our baseline Donchian commodity system from Chapter 5. Table 6.11
shows the trading statistics.

20 percent. Average draw‐down did not come down nearly as fast. This is
one of the few times I’ve seen that this filter did not help performance. Let’s
look at the longer‐term trend filter next.
■ Longer-Term Trend Filter (Commodities)
This filter is identical to the one we implemented in the stock system.
We only take trades if they are in the same direction as the longer‐
term trend, as determined by a comparison of today’s close with that of
x days ago. Table 6.12 shows trading results for look‐backs ranging from
30 to 90 days.

** New baseline
The 70‐day look‐back filter increases profit‐per‐trade by over 40 percent
while significantly lowering both average maximum draw‐down and max
draw‐down. It will be added to the existing strategy to form the new baseline.
■ Volatility-Based Filters (Commodities)
As we did with the stock strategy, we’ll test low‐ and high‐volatility filters based
on standard deviation and average range. Table 6.13 shows results when we
take only signaled trades that have a standard deviation greater than X dollars.
The standard deviation measure is the standard deviation of closing price for
the 20 days preceding the signal converted to dollars by multiplying the stan-
dard deviation point value by the dollars per trade for that commodity.

* Baseline
The low‐volatility filter does eliminate some of the less profitable trades,
as shown by increasing profit‐per‐trade in Table 6.13, but it doesn’t help
with the draw‐downs, so it won’t be added to the baseline. Next we’ll
test the high volatility standard deviation filter. Table 6.14 shows trading
results.

* Baseline
The high‐volatility standard deviation filter does improve trading, as
shown by the gain‐to‐pain ratio. Notice how the draw‐downs have been
drastically reduced. Let’s see if the low‐ and high‐volatility filters based on
range do a better job.
The low‐volatility filter using average range was tested, and the results
were about the same as the low‐volatility standard deviation filter, so they
won’t be added to the baseline. Table 6.15 shows the high‐volatility range
filter results. The average range is for the 20 days preceding the entry, and
the points have been converted to dollars by multiplying the average by the
dollars per point of the commodity.

In this case, the average range high‐volatility filter outperformed
the standard deviation filter. That’s not always the case. Performance has
jumped due to this filter and the system now meets our criteria for
tradeability.
The average annual return exceeds the max draw‐down and is over twice
■
as large as the average max draw‐down per year.
You could trade the strategy as is with $450,000 and average about
■
20 percent a year, with an average max draw‐down of less than 10 percent,
and a max draw‐down over 30 years of less than 20 percent.
Before we leave the development of the commodity strategy, there’s
one other thing we need to look at based on the results of Table 6.15,
which showed that we should bypass entries with a 20‐day average range
greater than $700. But suppose we enter a trade and things heat up. Maybe
the same filter should signal a trade exit if a certain volatility limit is
exceeded.
Table 6.16 shows the results if a trade is exited should the average range
of the last 20 trading days exceed a certain dollar limit. If the condition
exists on the close, exit is done on the next open.

TRADING
SYSTEM
ELEMENTS:
FILTERS
Looking over the performance by commodity, I’d offer the following
observations.
The grains, softs, metals, energies, currencies, and financials traded
■
well as groups, while the meats and stock indices did not. This is typical
of trend‐following strategies. I’ve never found a good way to trade the
meats, and the U.S. stock indices trade more like stocks than commodi-
ties. They are best traded with a counter‐trend approach.
Some commodities like coffee, nickel, the yen, the pound, the euro, the
■
bund, the gilt, and most of the stock indices traded relatively infrequent-
ly. This is due to the influence of the volatility filter and the way those
commodities are priced by the exchange. When the exchange settles on
a dollar‐per‐point value for a commodity, sometimes they are priced so
that a small percentage move causes a large dollar change (see the Rela-
tive Contract Risk section in Appendix B). The high‐volatility filter will
inhibit many of the trades in those commodities.
The long side makes almost three times as much money as the short side,
■
and the profit‐per‐trade is almost twice as large. Again, this is typical.
This finishes the development of the commodity strategy. In later chap-
ters we’ll wrap money management around it so it fits your account size and
risk‐taking profile.
■ Conclusion
In this chapter, we concluded the development of a stock and a commodity
strategy. They both now meet the criteria for being tradeable. For each rule
/parameter value a computer run generated trades across the entire basket,
and then an equity curve was built. From the equity curve, a gain‐to‐pain ratio
was formed by dividing the average annual profit by the average annual max
draw‐down. That metric was used to determine whether the rule/parameter
was added to the strategy to form a new baseline. You will have noted along
the way that we rejected some solutions that increased profit‐per‐trade or
total profit because the gain‐to‐pain metric indicted it wasn’t a better solution.
Chapter 7 will further address the importance of developing an integrated
risk/reward metric like the gain‐to‐pain ratio instead of total profit or total
profit per trade.

Development
W
hen I first started to develop trading systems, I used total profit
or average profit‐per‐trade as development performance metrics;
I never looked at draw‐down during the development process. When the
system was finished I’d wrap money management around it and then judge
how good it was. As you can see from the last three chapters, I now prefer
to include a simple form of money management in each step of the de-
velopment process, and my development metric is average profit‐per‐year
divided by average max draw‐down per year—the gain‐to‐pain ratio. Using
this process, I know from the start whether the system is tradeable from a
risk/reward point of view. Additionally, I don’t have to go back during the

money management process and see which system element is helping or
hurting risk; I’ve found that out in the development process.
The major advantage of incorporating money management in each step is
a better risk‐to‐reward system. But a side effect is that you can directly com-
pare any type of system against any other with their respective gain‐to‐pain
numbers. You can’t do that using total profit and profit‐per‐trade metrics.
With those metrics there’s no way to compare longer‐term, shorter‐term,
or scalping systems, and you certainly can’t compare commodity, stock, and
FX systems.
In this chapter, we’ll go through an abbreviated version of the develop-
ment process on our stock system and commodity systems, but with the
development metric being profit‐per‐trade instead of gain‐to‐pain. At the
end, the equity curves of the two sets of strategies will be compared. I think
you’ll agree that using a risk/reward metric like the gain‐to‐pain ratio in
your step‐by‐step development leads to a better solution.

The highest profit‐per‐trade is $90 at a 20‐bar look‐back, so that’s our
baseline entry. Next, dollar‐based catastrophic stops were examined and
a dollar stop value of $2,500 increased the profit‐per‐trade to $98, so that
stop was incorporated. Table 7.2 shows the results with the time‐based stop.
Exit is accomplished after x days, if the stop hasn’t been triggered.

With this version of the strategy, the time‐based exit didn’t increase the

egy, dollar‐based profit targets made a significant difference. Table 7.3 shows
how they perform on this version.

With a profit stop value of $1,500, profit‐per‐trade and average profit
per year go up marginally from the baseline, so we’ll keep it as the new
baseline and turn our attention to trading filters.
All the filter types we originally explored were re‐examined using a prof-
it‐per‐trade metric, and none could improve the current baseline with the
exception of the look‐back filter. The new baseline only takes the signaled
trades if current price is above the price of 70 days ago; profit‐per‐trade
improves to $104 per trade. Figure 7.1 shows the resultant equity curve.

Lastly, 7.4 compares year‐by‐year performance between the two devel-
oped strategies.
C learly the gain‐to‐pain solution is superior to the profi t‐per‐trade solu-
tion in both profi t‐per‐year and reduced draw‐down. Now let’s turn to the
commodity system and redevelop it using a profi t‐per‐trade development
metric.

A look‐back of 120 days maximizes the profit‐per‐trade, so that will form
our baseline for development. Next, we look at catastrophic stop levels.
As we did in our previous commodity system development, two vola-
tility‐based catastrophic stops were tested: average range and standard
deviation. For both tests, the 20 days of closing price data prior to entry and
the last 120 days of closing price data were used for the computations. The
120‐day parameter value was better, as was the catastrophic stop based on
standard deviation. Table 7.6 shows the results for multiples of the 120‐day
standard deviation stop value. Though profit‐per‐trade didn’t actually im-
prove with this stop value, some sort of stop protection is necessary for a
longer‐term trading system, and this was the best.

To complete the stop development, trailing stops and profit stops were
explored (as was done in Chapter 5), but nothing improved the baseline.
Next we’ll look at filters.
The first filter explored was the pullback filter we tried on the commod-
ity system in Chapter 6. The pullback filter waits for a down day to go long,
and an up day to go short, if the setup still exists. You’ll remember that,
for the strategy developed in Chapter 6, the pullback filter did improve
the profit‐per‐trade but that the gain‐to‐pain ratio wasn’t improved, so we
didn’t use it as a new baseline. Table 7.7 shows what happens to our current
baseline when the filter is added.

The pullback filter improves our profit‐per‐trade by $148, so it will be add-
ed to form the new baseline. Next we’ll look at the longer‐term trend filter.
The longer‐term trend filter inhibits trades that aren’t in the same direc-
tion as the longer‐term trend. We used a comparison of price on the close
of the day the signal is issued relative to that x days before to determine the
longer‐term trend. Since this strategy uses 120 days of information for en-
try, the comparison date has to be longer than 120 days. Table 7.8 shows the
results when the number of days of look‐back is varied.

Profit‐per‐trade peaked at $2,777 when a longer‐term trend look‐back fil-
ter of 200 days was used, so that filter will be added to form the new baseline.
The last set of filters to consider is the low‐ and high‐volatility filters. For
the volatility‐based range and standard deviation calculations, both 20‐ and
120‐day periods were examined. Turns out, the average range filter provides
better high‐ and low‐volatility performance than the standard deviation fil-
ter, and the recent 20‐day average range is better than the 120‐day average
range. Table 7.9 summarizes the computer runs for the high‐volatility filter.

P rofi t‐per‐trade peaked at $2,829 with a high‐volatility cutoff of $4,500,
so that condition will be added to form the new baseline. Lastly, Table 7.10
shows the performance of the low‐volatility fi lter.

The profi t‐per‐trade continued to increase for dollar threshold values up
to $1,000, but the average annual profi t continued to drop off dramatically.
Choosing a value of $200 seems a good compromise.

Table 7.11 shows that the average max draw‐down for the profit‐per‐
trade‐metric strategy is almost four times as large as that of the gain‐to‐
pain metric strategy. And the max draw‐down of $454,177 for the profit‐
per‐trade‐metric strategy is over six times as large as the $72,809 max
draw‐down for the gain‐to‐pain‐metric strategy.
One last note for those who choose to develop commodity strategies: Over
the 12‐year period from 2000 to 2011, the profit‐per‐trade‐metric strategy,
which was developed without any consideration of risk, had 10 years with a
max draw‐down of $100,000 or more. In the 20 years before the year 2000,
there was only one year where draw‐down exceeded $100,000 (1998). This
highlights the changing nature of commodity trading. Volatility is much higher
than it has ever been. And judging by the string of $200,000+ draw‐down
years from 2006 through 2011, volatility is still increasing. You just have to
develop strategies with a metric that includes risk.

■ Conclusion
In this chapter, the stock and commodity strategies were redeveloped using
a profit‐per‐trade metric. In both cases, the redeveloped strategies were
inferior to the baselines in equity curve appearance and gain‐to‐pain ratio.
In particular, the redeveloped commodity strategy suffered from the lack of
a risk metric in development.
There is still work to do with these strategies. Money management over-
lays will be applied in Chapters 12 through 15. But now let’s turn to an
exciting new way to develop strategies: bar scoring.

CHAPTER 8
Bar‐Scoring:
A New Trading
Approach
T
raditional system development has an obvious drawback: rules are
119
black or white; you can only enter when the entry logic conditions
are fully met, and only exit when an exit logic condition is fully met.
There are no shades of gray like: this is a weak entry; this is a very strong
entry; or this is a good entry even though one logic condition isn’t met.
In this chapter, I’ll introduce a new system development approach I call
bar‐scoring, which grades every instrument’s profit potential each bar.
Each bar is scored using any number of user‐defined criteria; the score is
the expected value of the profit in a user‐defined number of days after entry.
When the bar scores high the chances of an upward move are good;
when the bar scores low the chances of a downward move are good.
Bar‐scoring can be used as a standalone entry technique, an exit tech-
nique, or as an aid to other entry criteria.
This chapter will introduce bar‐scoring, provide a number of examples
of scoring criteria, and outline the scoring process. After this introduction,
a system will be developed on stock market daily‐bar data. That system will
use bar‐scoring as the final selection criteria for a group of possible trades
selected by a traditional entry technique. The issue of curve‐fitting will be
addressed with the system by doing a BRAC test.

■ The Shortcoming of Traditional System
Design Is Rigid Rules
In the Donchian system developed in Chapter 7, we used the Donchian 20‐day
high/low criteria, a 70‐day trend filter, and a high‐volatility filter to signal
entry. If an instrument meets the criteria on a given day, a trade is entered. If
it doesn’t meet every criterion, it is bypassed. What if 100 instruments meet
the entry conditions today? Is any set of entries better than another? Not by
the rigid rules of traditional design. How about if an instrument’s close above
a 20‐day high was also a close above an all‐time high, but the volatility was $1
too high? Wouldn’t that make a good entry? Bar‐scoring is a way to quantify
potential entries without requiring that specific entry criteria be met.
■ Introduction to Bar-Scoring
Bar‐scoring is an objective way to classify an instrument’s movement
potential every bar. The two parts to bar‐scoring are the criterion and the
resultant profit X days hence. Both the criterion and the number of days to
measure profit are user‐defined. Suppose you decide to use a 14‐bar RSI as
the criterion, and three days after entry as the point to measure profit. You’d
calculate the 14‐bar RSI for each bar and tag that RSI value with the profit
three days later, as if you’d entered a long trade on the open of the bar after
the RSI bar. Then you could sort the historical results by RSI value, keeping
that RSI value with its profit that three‐day period, from top to bottom into
a number of bins. Each bin should contain an equal number of RSI samples.
The results might look something like those is Table 8.1 for the NASDAQ
100 stocks from the year 2000 through the end of 2011.
TABLE 8.1 Bar‐Scoring NASDAQ Stocks by 14‐Day RSI and 3‐Day Return

Less than 37.08 30,000 0.17

121
BAR‐SCORING:
A
NEW
TRADING
APPROACH
Table 8.1 shows the counter‐trend nature of NASDAQ stocks. When the
RSI is low, the stocks tend to rally, and when the RSI is high, the stocks tend
to pull back. You could use a seven‐day RSI criterion and a one‐day return,
or a 50‐day RSI criterion and a 10‐day return. Everything is user‐defined.
Bar‐scoring is most powerful when a number of independent measures are
used and the results combined to form an aggregate bar score. You can cover
different time frames by using lengths varying from short‐term to long‐term
like a 3‐day, 14‐day, and 40‐day RSI as criteria. Or you can use different stock
properties like volume and acceleration as criteria. If more than one criterion
is used, all have to use the same number of bars from entry as the profit mea-
sure to be meaningful. The sum of the individual scores is the score for that
bar, and that score divided by the number of criteria that comprise it is the ex-
pected value of profit that many days in the future, had a trade been placed on
the next open. High scores should be traded long, and low scores are shorting
opportunities. The bar score can also be used as an exit technique. If you’re in
a long position and the bar score is very low, exit the trade.
On the scoring side, if you’re looking to trade short‐term, measure the
performance short‐term—a one‐, two‐, or three‐bar change. That doesn’t
mean you are limited to short‐term criteria; you can use a 40‐day RSI with
the one‐, two‐, or three‐day return. If you want to trade longer‐term, mea-
sure the return 20, 40, or even more bars out. You are limited only by your
imagination. But the scores in the resultant bins tell you how good a job you
did. You want separation—a wide range of values from the top scoring bin
to the bottom scoring bin. If the range from biggest return to the largest
loser is small, the criterion, or the number of days chosen for profit, isn’t
good and won’t help much in picking out good bars to trade long or short.
Scoring can also be done with other strategy elements you are comfort-
able trading. I short‐term trade in stocks by buying dips and using a profit
target on the first day after entry. If the profit target is not hit, I get out on
the open of the second day. I can trade with those exit rules, assuming I get
in long at the open each day with the best bar‐scoring stocks instead of buy-
ing the dip. This gives me the benefit of an exit strategy I like.
Bar‐scoring is applicable to any asset class, but in my opinion, it works best
when there are a lot of instruments. In the commodity world, there are fewer
than 100 liquid instruments. If you use bar‐scoring to determine the best signals
each bar, you’ll only have a couple, at most, to choose from; same thing in foreign
exchange (FX). But there are thousands of highly liquid U.S. stocks. Most sys-
tems will generate a bunch of trades each bar. Scoring those trades allows you to
quantify the best of the best. Or, you can build a bar‐scoring standalone system,
because with all the candidates, something will surely have a high score each bar.

■ Bar-Scoring Examples
Like any other technique, you need a lot of samples to minimize curve‐fi tting.
In this section, we’ll look at some examples using both stocks and commodi-
ties. For the stock examples, continuous contract, daily‐bar data on a basket
of 3,372 stocks going back to the year 2000 was used. Across these data,
there are about 3,500,000 bars of data where stock liquidity was greater than
$20,000,000. For commodities, we’ll use continuous contract, daily‐bar data
on a basket of 56 going back to 1980. Across these data there are about 363,000
bars of data through the end of the year 2011. In both the stock and commod-
ity examples, we’ll break the scoring results into equal‐size bins, as was done
in the RSI example earlier in this chapter, but instead of using 10 bins, as was
done in that example, we’ll use 20 bins going forward, unless otherwise noted.
In reality, the more bins you have the better. The only constraint is that there are
enough samples in each bin to minimize curve‐fi tting—many, many thousand.
Scoring by a Bar Type Criterion
There are a number of ways to classify a bar. Candlesticks are one, and the
relationship of the open, high, low, and close is another. I break the bar
down into the relationship of the close to the open in one of four ways: close
greater than open, and close in the upper half of the range; close greater
than open, and close in the lower half of the range; close less than or equal
to open, and close in the upper half of the range; and close less than or equal
to open, and close in the lower half of the range. I extend the total number
of categories from four to eight by adding the relationship of the close of
the bar to yesterday’s close. The eight bar types are illustrated in Figure 8.1 .

BAR‐SCORING:

NEW
TRADING
APPROACH
Table 8.2 shows bar type results for both stocks and commodities when
the scoring metric is return the following day. For stocks, the profit is cal-
culated as the percent change of the next bar’s close relative to its open, and
for commodities the profit is the dollar change of the next bar’s close versus
its open.
TABLE 8.2 Bar‐Scoring Example on Stock and Commodity Data by the Type
of Daily Bar
Stock Bar Type Breakout Commodity Bar Type Breakout
Bar Type Percent Return Bar Type Dollar Return
1 –0.008 1 –10.92
2 0.0054 2 –3.32
3 –0.0050 3 –1.00
4 0.1045 4 7.49
5 0.0008 5 9.35
6 –0.0007 6 12.66
7 –0.0041 7 18.63
8 0.0038 8 16.04
The returns on the stock side are relatively small, though bar-type 4 might
be useful. On the commodity side, it’s interesting to note that bar-types
5 through 8 all have a positive return, but in each case the close was less
than yesterday’s close. This shows that although commodities trend on daily
bars in the mid‐ to longer‐term time frame, on a one‐day basis they are
counter‐trend. Three of the four bar types that have an up close go down
the next day.
Scoring by the Number of Standard Deviations of
Closing Price above/below Average Criterion
For each bar the standard deviation of closing price for the last 20 days is
computed. Then the average of the last 20 closing‐price bars is subtracted
from the last closing price. This difference is divided by the standard devia-
tion value to provide the number of standard deviations that the last closing
price is above or below the 20‐day average price; that is the bar‐scoring
criterion. Table 8.3 shows price standard deviation results for both stocks
and commodities when the profit is return five days after entry.

When looking at these tables it is important to remember two things: The
bins in the respective stock and commodity categories each contain the same
number of trades, and all the days of stock history where liquidity is greater
than $20,000,000 are represented, as is every day that every commodity
traded. Looking at the information in Table 8.3, a number of interesting
observations can be made on both the stock and commodity side. For stocks:
The counter‐trend nature of stocks is evident. The most positive five‐day
■
return bins occur when the standard deviation is strongly negative, as
indicted by large negative SD values, and the strongest negative returns
occur when price is strongly moving up, as is evident with strongly posi-
tive SD numbers.
Across all the five‐day trades, the relentless upward bias of stocks can be
■
seen: Sixteen of the bins have an average trade expectation that is positive

125

APPROACH
over five days, while only four have a negative trade expectation over five
days. Also, the strongest positive expected value trade bin has a return
of 0.513 percent, which is over three times the magnitude of the largest
losing trade expected value of −0.141.
For commodities:
The trend‐following nature of commodities is evident. Positive returns
■
generally occur when SD is positive, and negative returns generally oc-
cur when the SD is negative. But there is a difference from stocks: The
strongest returns are not at the extreme bins. The largest positive return
occurs in the fifth bin down, while the largest negative return occurs in
the sixth bin from the bottom. Think about how this differs from conven-
tional system development; we never tested for long commodity trades
anywhere but near the top of the performance indicator, or short com-
modity trades anywhere but at the bottom extreme of an indicator. Bar‐
scoring picks out the best and worst performance, wherever it occurs.
The upward bias is evident because 12 of the 20 bins have a positive
■
return expectation.
Next let’s look at a volume criterion for bar‐scoring.
Scoring by Number of Standard Deviations of
Volume above/below Average Criterion
The computations for this criterion are the same as in the previous section,
but volume is used instead of closing price. For commodities, the volume
measure is volume across all contracts. Table 8.4 shows the results when the
last 20 days of volume are used in the standard deviation calculations and
profit is calculated five days after entry.
Volume is a measure seldom talked about in the trading literature, but
Table 8.4 shows that it can show opportunity. In stocks, those companies
whose volume is one standard deviation or more below average can expect,
on average, to see a two‐ to four‐times‐greater appreciation over the next
five days than the others. And in commodities, high volume (bins 1 and 2)
and very low volume (bin 20) are good predictors of a rise in price. In
fact, the best commodity bin in the price‐based standard deviation case was
$57.90, while volume bin 2 had a return of $58.
In the next section, we’ll develop a short‐term stock system using
bar‐scoring.

■ Example Stock System: Bar-Scoring with
Defined Criteria
An effective way to use bar‐scoring is as an adjunct to a fairly good entry. The
fairly good entry should generate a number of trades each bar. Bar‐scoring
then ranks the trades from top to bottom, and you only trade the best sig-
nals. Let’s look at using standard deviation as our fairly good entry for a long‐
only stock system. We know that using daily‐bar data stocks tend to move in
a counter‐trend manner. So we’ll look to buy stocks whose last close is some
number of standard deviations below their recent average price. Let’s look at
10‐day standard deviation and 20‐day standard deviation to start. The results
of entering on the next open and exiting on the open two days later for stocks
meeting the standard deviation criteria are shown in Table 8.5.

Number of Days for SD Number of Standard Deviations below Average Percentage Average Number

20 0.75 0.173 273
20 1.0 0.215 220

10 1.0 0.288 217
10 1.25 0.317 157
10 1.50 0.327 101
It’s clear that using 10 days for the standard deviation is the better num-
ber to use for the two‐day trade. The number of trades per day is about
the same as the corresponding 20‐day entry point, but the profit is higher
in all cases. We’ll use the 1.0 standard deviation point below the 10‐day
average as our baseline and see if bar‐scoring can significantly improve
profit‐per‐trade.
Using 10 days and one standard deviation below the average as entry cri-
teria, there were 595,806 trades, which averaged 0.288 percent per trade.
Some may question whether it’s worth pursuing a strategy that yields such a
low profit‐per‐trade. Since the trades last two days, you can trade about 125
two‐day cycles in a year. Before compounding, that’s 125 cycles per year
times 0.288 percent per cycle, or 36 percent per year, before slippage and
commission costs. In the previous calculations, no leverage was used. With
100 percent leverage, that number doubles to 72 percent per year. With
compounding (as the account grows continue to trade the entire amount
each cycle) the non‐margined and margined cases grow to 43 percent and
105 percent, respectively. That’s a very healthy return and, even with slip-
page and commission, it’s probably worth trading if the risk side is relatively
benign.
If we use 20 bins for our bar‐scoring criteria, the 595,806 trades break
down to about 30,000 samples per bin. That’s probably enough to minimize
curve‐fitting. But at the end of system development, we’ll do a curve‐fitting
check with the BRAC procedure.

Our defined entry criterion uses price action over 10 days. Let’s use
two more price criteria to define how weak each trade actually is: a 10‐day
standard deviation measure and a 20‐day standard deviation measure. Let’s
add a volume measure: the 20‐day standard deviation of volume. We’ll add
one volatility measure: the 10‐day standard deviation of range, normal-
ized by price. And lastly, our eight‐bin breakdown of bar type. That’s a total
of five criteria to characterize each bar. Table 8.6 shows the resultant bins
across the 595,806 trades.
The numbers that are in bold represent performance that’s greater
than the overall average trade for the entry alone, which is 0.288 percent
return‐per‐trade. The other numbers are penalty numbers; they are less
than the 0.288 average. Since every bar receives a score from each of the
five criteria, the highest ranking symbols each day are those that get a lot of
above‐average contributions and few less‐than‐average contributions. Note
that the highest score a bar can achieve is the sum of the highest returns in
each column: 0.387 + 0.418 + 0.535 + 1.768 + 0.475 = 3.583. Across the
585,806 bars, that score was never achieved.
The criteria reveal a lot about the stock market when short‐term trading
with daily bars:
Weak stocks with a high volatility have huge upside potential. The top 5
■
percent (bin 1) average a 1.768 percent gain over the next two days. And
the lower the volatility, the worse the two‐day returns, with the lowest
80 percent (bins 5 through 20) greatly underperforming the 0.288 per-
cent return average.
The weaker the stock, as measured by the two standard deviations of
■
price metrics, the better the performance, up to a point. Notice that
the bottom 5 percent in each of those columns (last bin) underperform
the 0.288 percent average performance. It probably means that some
of the weakest stocks are really losers and won’t bounce the way the
other weak stocks do.
High relative volume is good, except when volume approaches three
■
standard deviations above the average; maybe those are being dumped.
And low relative volume is good; maybe the strong hands know those
aren’t likely to fall further, so they don’t sell.
Weak 10‐day stocks that aren’t weak 20‐day stocks outperform as
■
shown by bins 1 and 2 of the 20‐day standard deviation of price
metric.

After each bar is scored by summing the contributions of the five cri-
teria, the 585,806 bars are sorted by date, and then by score on the date.
Table 8.7 shows performance across the top x scoring trades each day.
Sometimes there aren’t x trades on a given day because there aren’t that
many stocks trading at one standard deviation below the 10‐day average. The
percent of days that x trades occurs is also shown in the table.
TABLE 8.7 Bar‐Scoring System: Performance by Top x Trades per Day
Top Number of Trades Percent of Days the Number Average Percent
Each Day of Trades Occurs Return‐per‐Trade
1 100 0.739
5 99.9 0.509
10 99.8 0.441
20 98.8 0.398
50 90.1 0.352
100 66.8 0.318
In each of these cases, the average percent return‐per‐trade well exceeds
our 0.288 percent average, so bar‐scoring does allow us to significantly out-
perform the basic strategy.
Table 8.8 shows return and risk metrics when a simple form of money
management is used: We’ll trade x positions at a time by entering half of x
positions each day at a position size of total equity divided by x. So if our
starting equity is $50,000 and we want to trade 10 positions at a time, we
buy five $5,000 positions on the first day, and five $5,000 positions on the
second day. That has us fully invested, but not leveraged. Every succeeding
day, five positions are exited and five new positions are entered at a position
size of equity divided by 10.

50 47.2 44.5 18.2

BAR‐SCORING:

APPROACH
Table 8.8 shows that return and draw‐down diminish as the number of
trades each day goes from one to 10. From 10 to 50, the return stays about
the same but draw‐down continues to go lower. At 50 trades each day, we
have a pretty good trading solution; the return is over 2.5 times greater than
the average max draw‐down, and it is also bigger than the max draw‐down
over the time frame. For those want smaller draw‐downs, trade some frac-
tion of the total equity instead of all of it.
■ Is Bar-Scoring Curve-Fitting?
In the previous example, we used all the data to build the scoring met-
rics and then went back over all the data and scored each bar. When
we scored the first bar, we used all the bars we hadn’t seen yet in real
trading to assign its score. Obviously, this is curve‐fitting; we’re tak-
ing advantage of information that isn’t available yet. So the question is:
How bad is it? To answer that question, a BRAC test was done. Doing
the same development that was done in the last section, the strategy
was redeveloped, but all the 2011 stock data was withheld. Then the
curve‐fit 2010 results from the original strategy were compared with
the out‐of‐sample results for 2010 that were obtained with the redevel-
oped strategy on 2000 through 2010 data. Table 8.9 shows the results.
TABLE 8.9 Out‐of‐Sample BRAC Test Results versus Curve‐Fit Results
on Year 2011 Data
Top Number of Trades 2011 Average Percent Return‐per‐Trade 2011 Average Percent Return‐per‐Trade
Each Day with Curve‐Fit Strategy with Out‐of‐Sample Strategy
1 0.143 0.183
5 0.510 0.433
10 0.486 0.304
20 0.371 0.382
50 0.306 0.297
100 0.230 0.231
Average 0.341 0.305
With the exception of the top 5 and top 10 trades’ results, the two sets
match up pretty well. Maybe the best comparison is the average line. The
curve‐fit solution outperforms the out‐of‐sample data strategy by about
12 percent. There is an element of curve‐fitting, but it probably inflates per-
formance by only 10 to 15 percent.

■ Conclusion
A new strategy development tool was introduced in this chapter: bar‐scoring.
Bar‐scoring assigns a profit expectation to each bar by using a large set
of similar setups and their average return over the expectation period.
Bar‐scoring can be used for entries, for exits, or as an adjunct to some spe-
cific entry logic.
Bar‐scoring does have a degree of inherent curve‐fitting, but a BRAC test
can give a fair estimate of the degree of overfitting.

J
ack Schwager is a giant in the futures industry. I consider his book A
Complete Guide to the Futures Markets to be the most comprehensive and
definitive publication on futures analysis ever written. And his Market
Wizard series of books show, in an entertaining way, that there are many
ways to make money trading. But when I hear his name, the one thing that
jumps to mind is what he had to say in an article for Futures magazine titled
“The Well‐Chosen Example.”
If you’ve read any books on trading, you’ve run across it: The author
makes an authoritative statement like “always look to fade the gap” or “al-
ways look to trade in the direction of the trend,” and then shows a chart that
has three perfect examples making his point. That’s it—the total extent of
the proof. Don’t be taken in. Just because it’s stated in print doesn’t make
it true. If you’re going to be one of those who makes money trading, you
need to question everything. This is a fun chapter for me because I’m going
to question some of the repeating themes, and instead of using one chart
to prove or disprove the claim, I’ll be looking for a large body of trades to
provide the answer.

■ A Divergence Is a Strong Signal
This is my favorite. I’ve seen this so many times in print, it just has to be
true. A divergence occurs when price makes a new high or low, but an
accompanying momentum indicator doesn’t. Commonly used momentum
indicators are stochastics, relative strength index (RSI), moving average
convergence divergence (MACD), and momentum itself. Divergence buy
and sell signals look like the graphics in Figure 9.1.
The potential power of these signals is obvious. If they’re right, they’re
picking the bottom or top of the previous move, which gives you a chance to
get the whole move in the other direction, rather than just a piece of it like
a trend‐following strategy might get. Let’s see how divergence trades work
on stocks. Here are the rules we’re testing:
Price divergence short setup: Y esterday’s close is a Donchian 14‐day high,
■
and it was higher than the last Donchian 14‐day high. There was a Don-
chian 14‐day low between these highs. Today’s close is less than yester-
day’s close.
Momentum divergence short setup: Y esterday’s momentum reading was
■
lower than the momentum reading on the day of the previous 14‐day
Donchian high.
Divergence short entry: Enter short market on open.
■
Divergence short exit: Compile statistics for exits 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30
■
days after entry.
Price divergence buy setup: Yesterday’s close was a Donchian 14‐day low,
■
and it was lower than the last Donchian 14‐day low. There was a 14‐day
Donchian high between the two lows. Today’s close is higher than yester-
day’s close.
Momentum divergence setup: Y esterday’s momentum reading was higher
■
than the momentum reading on the day of the previous 14‐day Donchian
low.
Divergence buy entry: Enter long market on open.
■
Divergence buy exit: Compile statistics for exits 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30
■
days after entry.

We’re using 14‐day Donchian highs and lows, so let’s use a 14‐day mo-
mentum calculation. The equation is:
Momentum Today = Closing Price Today – Closing Price 14 Days Ago
Table 9.1 shows the trade statistics across the Nasdaq 100 stock basket
over the 2000–2011 time frame.
TABLE 9.1 Trading Stock Divergences with Various Hold Periods
Hold Period Winning Trades Losing Trades Total Profit Percent Profit‐per‐Trade Percent
5 2,343 2,371 –534 –0.11
10 2,282 2,432 –1,228 –0.26
15 2,314 2,400 –408 –0.09
20 2,316 2,398 –370 –0.08
30 2,320 2,394 –1,687 –0.35
I’d call the results unimpressive. There’s certainly no appreciable
edge trading the divergences, or doing the opposite and fading the
divergences. Let’s look at trading divergences on commodities with the
same rules.
Table 9.2 shows the statistics across the 56‐commodity basket we’ve been
using over the 1980–2011 time frame.
TABLE 9.2 Trading Commodity Divergences with Various Hold Periods
Hold Period Winning Trades Losing Trades Total Profit ($) Profit‐per‐Trade ($)
5 2,368 2,807 –319,551 –62
10 2,313 2,862 –623,435 –120
15 2,321 2,854 –980,151 –189
20 2,311 2,864 –1,037,318 –200
30 2,334 2,841 –1,200,722 –232
These results are significant. Trading the divergences is definitely the
wrong thing to do. You should be fading them. When you get a long signal,
sell on the next open; and when you get a short signal, buy on the next open.
What about the momentum part? Our setups require that momentum and
price be moving in the opposite direction on trade day. What if we fade the
buy and sell signals when momentum is moving in the same direction as
price? Here are the new rules:

These results are very promising and could form the basis of a trade-
able strategy. I think we can conclude that divergence trading doesn’t have
a significant edge in either stock or commodity trading; in fact, for com-
modities you’d be much better off trading in the opposite direction on each
divergence signal.

■ Buy/Fade a Gap
Gaps are a subject in most trading books. An opening gap is formed when
the open of a bar is outside the range of the previous bar. If that bar’s range
stays entirely outside the previous bar’s range, it’s a bar gap. Some of the
prevailing theories on gaps are:
Gaps on longer time‐frame charts are more significant than those on
■
shorter time‐frame charts; a gap on a weekly chart is more meaningful
than one on a daily chart.
Price moves to fill the gap.
■
Gaps out of price consolidation signal the start of a breakout in the direc-
■
tion of the gap.
Gaps in the direction of a sustained move can signal continuation of the
■
strong move, or exhaustion with a reversal in price imminent.
In this section we’ll explore opening gaps and bar gaps for both stocks
and commodities.
Opening Gaps in Stocks
Using our 100‐stock basket of Nasdaq stocks, gap‐trade statistics were
found on all the opening gaps in the 2000–2011 time frame. Gap trades
are based on entering long on the open and exiting on the following open.
A $5,000 position was taken in each trade. Table 9.4 summarizes the trade
information.
Scanning the table, you could conclude the following:
Opening gaps aren’t shorting opportunities. There was only one gap
■
setup (the last row) where the long trades lost money. That means
doing the opposite and shorting those setups would have made mon-
ey, but it’s only $2 per trade—not even enough to cover transaction
costs.
All the gaps opening below yesterday’s low made money on the long side.
■
That’s in keeping with the counter‐trend nature of stocks: Weakness is a
buying opportunity. Further, those opening below yesterday’s low when
the trend was down did better than those that occurred when the trend
was up.

I think the most useful setup is the first: an open below yesterday’s low,
■
irrespective of trend. There are over 31,000 occurrences in the 12‐year
period, which averages to about 10 a day. This might prove to be a good
starting point for a tradeable long‐only stock strategy.
Let’s do the same opening gap analysis on commodities.
Opening Gaps in Commodities
Using our 56‐commodity basket, the same opening gap statistics were com-
piled. Differences in this analysis are that gaps up are traded long, and gaps
down are traded short. Gap trades are entered on the open the day of the
gap and exited on the next open. A one‐lot (one contract) position was
taken in each trade. Table 9.5 summarizes the results.
The results were negative in 10 out of the 12 cases. This parallels the way the
pullback filter from Chapter 6 works on commodities: An up day is followed by
a down day, a down day is followed by an up day, a down day in an uptrend gets
a big bounce up the next day, and an up day in a down trend turns more strongly

down the next day. The openings that gap up are particularly interesting as short‐
term shorting opportunities, especially in light of the fact that commodities have
an upward bias. It’s nice to find a way to make money trading against the bias.
One last note about opening gaps. Larry Williams introduced a short‐
term trading system he called OOPS based on these gaps. His logic is that
overnight news or opinion is occasionally so bullish or bearish for a given
commodity that traders rush in at the opening and drive price to a gap open-
ing. In the light of day, the true story causes a reversal of opinion and traders
say “oops” as they hastily cover their positions and price reverses.
Let’s now look at bar gaps for both stocks and commodities.
Bar Gaps in Stocks
If gaps are trading opportunities, a bar gap should be more meaningful than
an opening gap because price maintained the gap for the entire bar. Let’s look
at two cases. First is a bar gap coming out of congestion. There are many ways
to define congestion, but a relatively simple one is to look at the recent range
in relation to the standard deviation of closing price. If the range from the

141

BY
THE
“WELL‐CHOSEN
EXAMPLE”
highest high to the lowest low over a recent period is less than one or two
standard deviations of closing price over the same period, the stock is more or
less range‐bound. Using our 100‐stock basket of Nasdaq stocks, statistics were
found on all the bar gaps that occurred when the 10‐day range was less than
one standard deviation of price and less than two standard deviations of price.
When a bar gap occurred, trade entry was the open of the day following the
gap, and profit was taken five days later on the open. A $5,000 position was
taken in each trade. Table 9.6 summarizes the information.
TABLE 9.6 Bar Gaps out of Congestion on Nasdaq Stocks, 2000–2011
Bar Gap Description Winning Trades Losing Trades Profit‐per‐Trade
Above congestion when range 163 152 $ 0.50
< 1 standard deviation
Above congestion when range 1257 1,290 –$11.50
< 2 standard deviations
Below congestion when range 95 113 $16.50
< 1 standard deviation
Below congestion when range 1,076 791 $63.00
< 2 standard deviation
For stocks, bar gaps out of congestion are not breakouts in the direction of
the gap. In fact, they’re pretty good counter‐trend setups. Note that a breakout
above congestion when the 10‐day range is less than two standard deviations
of closing price actually leads to a small profit if we sell at the signal instead of
buy. And buying stocks that gap down when the range is less than two standard
deviations nets 1.26 percent per trade in five days ($63/$5,000). That’s a non‐
compounded annual rate of over 60 percent if you could do trades consecutively.
Now let’s look at bar gaps that occur when the stock isn’t in congestion.
For that case we can use a 10‐day range that’s larger than one or two stan-
dard deviations of price. The results are shown in Table 9.7.
TABLE 9.7 Bar Gaps without Congestion on Nasdaq Stocks, 2000–2011

deviations

Gaps without congestion behave pretty much the same as gaps out of conges-
tion: They are counter‐trend setups. Table 9.8 summarizes the bar gap results
without a congestion modifier; the gaps just break the 10‐day high or 10‐day low.
TABLE 9.8 Bar Gaps on Nasdaq Stocks, 2000–2011
Bar Gap Description Winning Trades Losing Trades Profit‐per‐Trade
Bar gap up 4,094 4,034 –$ 7.50
Bar gap down 3,568 2,700 $56.50
Bar gaps up might be worth exploring as a short setup, while bar gaps
down could probably be the start of a tradeable long‐only strategy.
Bar Gaps in Commodities
This section parallels the bar‐gap analysis just presented for stocks. Using
the 56‐commodity basket over the 1980–2011 time frame, Table 9.9 shows
the results of trading bar gaps out of 10‐day congestion: Trade entry was
on the open following the gap and exit was done on the open five days
later. Again, bar gaps up are long trades, and bar gaps down are short trades.
TABLE 9.9 Bar Gaps out of Congestion on Commodities
Bar Gap Description Winning Trades Losing Trades Profit‐per‐Trade
Above congestion when range < 1 standard 303 289 –$75

Above congestion when range < 2 standard 2,798 2,827 –$88
deviations
Below congestion when range < 1 standard 274 259 $ 5
deviation
Below congestion when range < 2 standard 2,362 2,493 –$34
deviations
As with stocks, commodity bar gaps out of congestion are not breakouts
in the direction of the gap; they’re counter‐trend setups.
Table 9.10 shows the results when the commodity is not in congestion
and it has a bar gap. Long trades are taken on the open after a bar gaps above
the 10‐day high when the non‐congestion criterion is met, and short trades
are taken on the open after a bar gaps below the 10‐day low. Exit is done on
the open five days after entry.

Bar gaps when a commodity is not in congestion are a marker for a break-
out in the direction of the trend. Because of the relative success of the long
and short trades when the 10‐day range is greater than two standard devia-
tions of closing price, I looked at an added trend condition. Table 9.11 shows
the results when the bar gap is also in the direction of the 20‐day trend.
TABLE 9.11 Bar Gaps without Congestion on Commodities in the Direction
of the Trend
Bar Gap Description Winning Trades Losing Trades Profit‐per‐Trade
Bar gap up when range > 2 standard 4,918 4,411 $163
deviations, and close the day before the gap
greater than the close 20 days previous
Bar gap down when range > 2 standard 4,180 4,107 $64
deviations, and close the day before the gap
less than the close 20 days previous
Clearly a bar gap out of congestion and in the direction of the trend is a
good pointer to a trend continuation. This entry logic might lead to a trade-
able strategy.
■ Trade Fibonacci Retracements
The Fibonacci sequence was introduced by Leonardo of Pisa in 1202. It is
a sequence formed by adding the previous number in the sequence to the
current number to form the next number, with the first two numbers being
0 and 1, by definition. The following is the start of the sequence:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377

144

YB
DEYAWS
GNIEB
DIOVA
The significance of the sequence is that many recurring patterns in na-
ture have similar patterns, or they have patterns that reduce to the ratio of
adjacent Fibonacci numbers. The Golden Ratio, in particular is a ratio well
documented in the literature. It is the limit of the last two numbers near
infinity of the sequence. So ratios based on the adjacent numbers shown
above are:
First/Second = 0, 1, 0.5, 0.667, 0.60, 0.625, 0.615, 0.619, 0.618,
0.618, 0.618
Second/First = 4, 1, 2, 1.5, 1.667, 1.6, 1.625, 1.615, 1.619, 1.618,
1.618, 1.618
As the sequence gets longer, the ratios between the numbers one, two,
and three places apart converge to the following ratios:
One apart
55/89, 89/144 = 0.618
89/55, 144/89 = 1.618
Two apart
55/144, 89/233 = 0.382
144/55, 233/89 = 1.382
Three apart
55/233, 55/377 = 0.236
233/55, 377/55 = 1.236
These are the Fibonacci numbers the literature regards as important,
though some add 0.5 to the mix. The way these numbers are traded on
the long side is to wait for a pullback from the trend of 23.6 percent, or
38.2 percent, or 50 percent, or 61.8 percent of the move, and then buy,
expecting a reversal. Thus they are regarded as support points where an
up‐trend should resume its rally, or where a down‐trend resumes its fall.
Conversely, the 1.236, 1.382, and 1.618 points are regarded as resistance
points where profits should be taken or the position lightened up.
In this section we’ll look at trading our stock and commodity baskets us-
ing the Fibonacci numbers as support. The only element that needs to be de-
fined is the price point that retracement or profit should be measured from.
Let’s use the same Donchian points we used in the divergence section of this
chapter. If there is a 14‐day Donchian low followed by a 14‐day Donchian
high, the trend must be up. We’ll use the difference between the Donchian
high and low points as the measuring point for a Fibonacci retracement and
buy if there is a pullback of 23.6 percent, 38.2 percent, or 61.8 percent

of the distance, and measure reaction after that. Conversely, if there is a
14‐day high, followed by a 14‐day low, the trend is down, and we’ll look
to sell at up moves from the low at our Fibonacci retracement points.
Figure 9.2 shows buy and sell logic.

The trading rules used are:
Long trades: If the last Donchian 14‐day high occurred after the last
■
14‐day low, the distance in points between the high and low is multiplied
by the Fibonacci retracement fraction. That value is subtracted from the
14‐day high to form the entry target. If there is a close below the entry
target, a trade is entered on the next open. Trade profit is computed 5,
10, 15, and 20 days after entry.
Short trades: If the last Donchian 14‐day low occurred after the last
■
14‐day high, the distance in points between the high and low is multiplied
by the Fibonacci retracement fraction. That value is added to the 14‐day
low to form the entry target. If there is a close above the entry target, a
trade is entered on the next open. Trade profit is computed 5, 10, 15, and
20 days after entry.
Fibonacci Retracements with Stocks
Because of the difficulty in profitably trading stocks from the short side,
we’ll look at the long trades and short trades separately. Table 9.12 shows
the results of taking long trades on the basket of Nasdaq stocks when the
Fibonacci retracement level is 23.6 percent of the distance from the
Donchian low to the Donchian high.
TABLE 9.12 Stock Trading Long: Fibonacci Retracements of 23.6 Percent

20 3,652 2,957 9,361 1.42 17.8
The annualized return of the last column is just the average number of
trading days per year (250) divided by the number of days in the trade,
multiplied by the profit‐per‐trade. The results are certainly positive with a
nice annualized return for a five‐day hold. Table 9.13 shows the results for a
retracement percent of 38.2.
These results are not nearly as good as the results with the 23.6 percent
retracement.

20 2,295 1,964 3,898 0.92 11.5
Let’s now look at the short side with a 23.6 retracement. Table 9.14
shows the results of going short when price closes over 23.6 percent of the
down move above the 14‐day Donchian low.
TABLE 9.14 Stock Trading Short: Fibonacci Retracements of 23.6 Percent

20 3,355 4,052 –8,386 –1.13 –14.1
Again, it’s very hard to trade stocks profitably form the short side.
So, does this mean that Fibonacci levels are a meaningful approach
for trading stocks from the long side, especially at the 23.6 retrace-
ment level? Not necessarily. If I were exploring retracement trading,
I’d look at levels like 5 percent, 10 percent, 15 percent, 20 percent,
and so on. If the results of that analysis were on the same level as the
Fibonacci retracement levels, I’d conclude that in trading, numbers
are numbers; there are no special ones. Table 9.15 shows the results of
those runs.
Table 9.15 shows that the best retracement level probably lies between
20 and 25 percent in all cases. To nail down whether the peak really is at
23.6 percent, another set of runs was made at 21, 22, 23, and 24 percent
retracement levels. The peak actually occurs at 21 percent. The annualized
five‐day return for the 21 percent retracement level was 33.5 percent, 1
percent higher than the return at 23.6 percent. I think we can conclude that
with very noisy data, like stock market data, numbers are just numbers;
there are no magic ones.

Fibonacci Retracements with Commodities

the 1980 through 2011 time frame. Table 9.16 shows the results using a
Fibonacci retracement level of 23.6 percent for both long and short trades.

Table 9.16 shows that a 23.6 percent retracement is more likely to signal
a trend reversal than a resumption of the trend. The bigger retracement
points had increasingly bigger losses as evidenced by the 38.2 retracement
results shown in Table 9.17.
TABLE 9.17 Trading Fibonacci Retracements of 38.2 Percent on Commodities

15 6,785 7,308 –1,011,355 –72
20 6,744 7,349 –1,362,637 –97
Clearly Fibonacci retracements do not signal a trend resumption for
commodities; they are more likely to signal a trend reversal.
■ Buy Stock Splits
On the face of it, this would appear to be a dubious strategy. When the price
of a stock splits, the number of shares that a trader owns moves up (reverse
split) or down (normal split) in accordance with the split so that at the end
of the process the dollar value of his or her stock remains unchanged. For
instance, if you acquire 100 shares of stock xyz at a price of 60, and on the
day of the split the price is still 60, and it splits 2 for 1, you will now own
200 shares at a price of 30. Before the split your 100 shares at 60 were worth
$6,000, and after the split your 200 shares at $30 are worth $6,000.
To see if there really is something to the strategy, an analysis was con-
ducted around all of the split dates on 3,400 highly liquid stocks from the
start of 2000 until the end of 2011. There were a total of 1,322. Long trade
entry was done on the open some number of days before the split date and
exited on the open some number of days after the split date. The perfor-
mance metric used was percent profit appreciation over the holding period.
Table 9.18 summarizes the results for normal splits.
Table 9.18 shows that there is a nice return for the strategy. You want to
get your position about a week before the split and exit shortly after. Based
on profit‐per‐day of the holding period, entering six trading days before
the split and exiting the day after the split looks to have the best return. To
see if the split return really outperformed the market, I accumulated profit
statistics on the S&P 500 ETF (symbol SPY) for every period a stock was in
a split trade. Here’s the apples‐to‐apples comparison.

So the split trades outperformed the market by an average of 1.08 per-
cent per trade. Since the holding period is eight days, and there are about
254 trading days a year, you could do about 32 trades a year, if there were
a split available at the right time. That’s 32 times 1.21 percent, or about
39 percent per year, without any compounding. Of course the splits aren’t
going to line up perfectly, but these trades are definitely worth considering
as an add‐on to anything else you’re trading.
Table 9.18 was for normal splits. Let’s see if the same thing works for
reverse splits. Table 9.19 shows the trade results.

“WELL‐CHOSEN
EXAMPLE”
The reverse splits behave differently than the regular splits. They are ex-
cellent shorting opportunities. Too bad they happen so infrequently.
Why there is an edge when buying normal stock splits is a matter for
speculation. The companies that do it usually do it so that stock is easier to
accumulate for small investors. Maybe that’s the reason, but I suspect the
real reason is that less‐sophisticated investors think they’re getting some-
thing for nothing.
■ Buy Stocks that Pay Dividends
When you buy a stock that pays a dividend, on the day of the dividend pay-
out that amount is subtracted from closing price by the exchange. So you get
the dividend, but your position is adversely impacted by the same amount.
This is another strategy that should be a zero‐sum game over a small period
of time around the dividend date (except for tax purposes), but let’s see.
The same stock database used for the split analysis was used again. A position
was bought in the stock one month before the dividend date. A month was
used because you need to be a stock owner before the ex‐dividend date and
a month will generally assure that. On the open five days after the dividend
date, the trade was exited and the dividend amount was added in to yield
a percentage profit for the trade. Across the 3,400 stocks used, there were
over 50,000 dividend payouts. The following are the stats over the 26‐day
trade:
Winning trades: 32,284
Losing trades: 22,503
Average percent profit‐per‐trade: 1.48 percent
Not bad. There are almost 10 full 26‐day periods a year. If you could
average 1.48 percent per trade, your compound return would be almost
16 percent.
The news gets better if you consider the dividend as a percent of price.
Table 9.20 shows the breakdown when the size of the dividend in relation
to its price is considered.
The best trades occur when the dividend is a relatively high percentage of
the entry price. Because of the large number of opportunities, a tradeable
stock strategy might be built around timing entry into the dividend trades
when the stock is in a short‐term pullback.

■ Conclusion
In this chapter we looked at some issues that arise over and over again in the
trading literature. The point really wasn’t to support or defame the claims. It
was to show a methodology you can use to address these types of issues with
your own analysis when you come across something that looks interesting
or too good to be true.

f you read a lot about trading, you will see the same claims and maxims
repeated over and over again. In this chapter, we’ll examine some of this
trading lore and see that a little analysis can uncover whether it’s truth or not.
■ The Exit Is More Important than the Entry
I was looking at a trading‐related web site and saw a posting stating that 153
the exit is more important than the entry. The blogger stated that anyone
can get in at some point as the trend unfolds, but the key is getting out
near the end of the run. He further claimed that a good exit can even
make money with a random entry. Those statements go against everything
I believe about trading, so I asked him for an example. He pointed me
to words written by Van K. Tharp in Trade Your Way to Financial Freedom.
Here’s what was said:
Actually, it has been proven that with good exits and money man-
agement, you can even profit on random entries into the market.
Take the following real life example: Tom Basso designed a simple,
random‐entry trading system. We determine the volatility of the
market by a 10‐day exponential moving average of the average true
range. Our initial stop was three times that volatility reading. Once
entry occurred by a coin flip, the same three‐times‐volatility stop
was trailed from the close. However, the stop could only move in
our favor. Thus, the stop moved closer whenever the markets moved
in our favor or whenever volatility shrank. We also used a 1 percent
(cid:30)(cid:22)(cid:6)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:28)(cid:3)(cid:12)(cid:6)(cid:4)(cid:43)(cid:12)(cid:3)(cid:9)(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:4)(cid:13)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:26)(cid:19)(cid:16)(cid:5)(cid:3)(cid:40)(cid:16)(cid:20)(cid:9)(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:4)(cid:13)(cid:4)(cid:43)(cid:12)(cid:3)(cid:9)(cid:26)(cid:5)(cid:2)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:3)(cid:8)(cid:6)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:9)(cid:1)(cid:11)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:9)(cid:44)(cid:3)(cid:2)(cid:23)(cid:14)(cid:2)(cid:40)(cid:9)(cid:4)(cid:16)

risk model for our position sizing. . . . [Looks like a legit approach
so far, random entry, stop exit.]
We ran it on 10 markets. And it was always in each market, either
long or short depending upon a coin flip. . . it made money 100 percent
of the time when a simple 1 percent money management system was
added. . . . The system had a [trade success] reliability of 38 percent,
which is about average for a trend‐following system.
The fallacy of this approach is in the last paragraph. Since “it was always in
each market,” the strategy wasn’t entering the markets randomly (after the
first random entry); it was entering on a specific bar when the stop said to get
in. The stop was an entry signal for the next bar. It was a reversal system, but
half the time it didn’t reverse. And the expected value of the entry was so
high that it overcame going in the wrong direction half the time.
Because the first paragraph provided a specific example of a random en-
try with a specific stop that I could test, I conducted the following analy-
sis. I used data from my basket of 56 commodities, randomly entered each
100 times, and exited after the entry point when the stop criterion was
met. That’s 7,000 random trades across the basket per run. I did 100 runs,
700,000 random trades. The results? The average trade made $0.000025.
Statistically, that’s no different from 0. That’s exactly the same answer I’d
get if I’d randomly entered and randomly exited. In other words, the exit is
identical to a random exit.
Let’s look at the second paragraph again. I contend that the only reason
the strategy “made money 100 percent of the time” is due to the power of
the reversal entry. It’s good enough to make money even when you enter
in the wrong direction half the time. In the cases where you enter in the
wrong direction, you’ll quickly get stopped out and have the opportu-
nity to get right with the trend on the next flip. So I randomly entered
on day one of the data for each commodity and reversed trade direction
every time the stop was hit. The results? Across the 56 markets, there
were 6,261 wins and 9,736 losses, for a profit of $3,818,975, or $239
per trade. Remember the exit on this system is no better than an exit on a
random bar system. The whole $4M is due to the entry. The bottom line
is that this example doesn’t prove how powerful the exit is; it proves the
power of a good entry.
I believe that there are good exits and bad exits, but none can make
you money on a random entry into the market. What they do is sig-
nal when your good entry (hopefully) has played out either in profit or

155

loss and it’s time to move on to the next trade. Good exits have these
characteristics:
They don’t take you out of the trade until the profit potential has had a
■
chance to be realized. Translation: The stop is not too tight initially.
They take you out of the trade if the setup doesn’t work out. Translation:
■
The stop is not too loose initially.
They don’t cut off big winners prematurely. Translation: The stop stays
■
outside of normal market noise as trade profit is accrued.
They keep most of your open‐equity profit. Translation: When the move
■
is over, the stop gets you out before you give back too much.
Also, what will be a good set of exits on one system will be a terrible set on
another. Just look at the exits for our long‐only stock system. Because we’re
scalping, the exits are tight and the profit‐target is modest. That exit logic
would turn our Donchian‐based commodity system into a loser. And the exits
from the commodity strategy would make the stock strategy a loser.
■ Defining Money Management
Money management is: more important than the strategy; the most impor-
tant factor for successful trading; the most important factor in becoming a
long‐term winner; the most significant part of any trading system.
If you search the Internet or read the money management sections of
trading books, you’ll see a lot of statements like those. Is money manage-
ment that important? Can we just throw away our trading strategy, become
money management gurus, and then manage our way to success? I believe
that, like “the exit is more important than the entry,” those statements go
way overboard. We’ll see what money management can do for our two de-
veloped strategies in the rest of this book, but for now, please don’t toss
them away as unimportant.
If you read through the articles that accompany the money management
statements, you’ll see the same themes:
Most trading strategies win less than 50 percent of the time. If you don’t
■
manage them carefully, you can wind up broke.
A room full of PhDs was asked how much to bet each round on a strat-
■
egy that made as much as it lost each round and won 60 percent of

156
EROL
GNIDART
the rounds. Taking their bet size and randomly selecting outcomes for
100 rounds, only 10/8/6/4/2 percent had money at the end.
The Kelly criteria can make your 10 percent a year strategy a 50/100/150
■
/200 percent a year strategy.
The optimal money management strategy is optimal f/fixed risk/fixed
■
size/fixed ratio.
One thing they have in common is that they all claim bad money manage-
ment can make a winning strategy go bust, but they never claim average/
good/excellent money management can make a losing strategy a winner. If
you have no edge, you can’t win, even with the best money management.
(Go to Vegas and find out.) So really, what’s more important the edge or
how you manage it?
The real issue I have with these claims is that most of them are actually
deceiving. The first bullet slams trend‐following implying that strategies that
win less than 50 percent of the time are riskier than strategies that win a
lot. You used to see ads for strategies claiming 90/95/98 percent winners.
Those ads were for options strategies where you’re selling far‐out‐of‐the‐
money puts or calls for a small premium. Wins were very small, but if you
got tagged with a loser, you could give back everything you’d won, and a lot
more. Winning a high percentage of trades doesn’t make a strategy less risky
than one that doesn’t. Until the early 2000s, the vast majority of commodity
trading advisors (CTAs) were trend‐followers of one sort or another. As
such, almost all of them had winning trade percentages less than 50 percent.
If trend‐following is such a risky strategy, why did the most successful trad-
ers in the world employ it? The answer is that when your winning trades
make three to five times, on average, what your losers lose, it’s a money‐
making deal.
The second and third bullets take gambling analogies and apply them
to trading. The Kelly criterion only applies to binomial outputs like win
or lose. Gamblers use it to determine optimal bet size when they know
their trading edge, and the outcomes are like roulette: You bet on red or
black, and either win or lose. In trading you can win anything from $1 to
$10,000 or more with a longer‐term trend‐following strategy, and lose
anything from, say, $1 to $3,000. The occurrence rates at the extremes
are low, while they’re higher for small wins and losses. It’s like a box of
chocolates. Those types of distributions can’t be meaningfully analyzed
using the Kelly criterion.

157

But let’s do what these articles do and play with some numbers. Let’s
start with the Kelly criteria. In its simplest form, the amount we should bet
when our edge (winning percent) is p, and our odds are 1‐to‐1 (if we win,
we win $1 for every $1 bet, and get our bet back) is shown by the following
formula:
Bet size = p – (1 – p)/1
In the case where p = 60 percent and the odds are even‐money, bet size
is 20 percent of bankroll each time you bet. If the odds are 2‐to‐1 (win
$2 for every $1 bet), the bet size is:
Bet size = p – (1 – p)/2
If the winning percentage in this case stayed at 60 percent, the bet size
would be 40 percent. Let’s simulate the first case and look at results. A
random number generator was used to yield 60 percent winning trades
and 40 percent losing trades. Starting with a bankroll of $100, and bet-
ting 20 percent of the bankroll on each random draw, 100 draws were
done for each run. To yield meaningful summary statistics, 1,000 runs
were done.
At the end of the runs, the aggregate results showed:
82 percent of the time the equity at the end of the 100‐trade sequence
■
was higher than the starting bankroll of $100.
18 percent of the time the ending equity was less than the starting
■
bankroll.
2 percent of the time the sequence went bust, defined as a point where
■
equity got down to less than $5. (Note that results can never go negative
because we’re betting 20 percent of the existing equity each round. As
the bankroll gets smaller, the magnitude of the bets also gets smaller, but
never negative.)
The average ending result was $4,966. The $100 grew to $4,966, almost
■
a 5,000 percent return.
You might be thinking, “What’s so bad about that?” The only risk met-
rics are the percent of the time you finished with less than you started
(18 percent) and the percent of the time you went bust (about 2 percent).
There are none of the metrics we used in Chapter 1 when a tradeable

158
EROL
GNIDART
strategy was discussed. So I went back and found the draw‐down metrics
for the 1,000 runs.
The average biggest draw‐down was 77.3 percent across the 1,000 runs.
■
16 percent of the runs had draw‐downs of 90 percent or greater.
■
The best run “only” had a max draw‐down of 36 percent.
■
When you start trading one of these 100‐trade sequences, you expect to
see a 77 percent draw‐down in your bankroll at some point. I think the bot-
tom line is that it’s called “gambling” for a reason. It isn’t investing; it isn’t
trading; it isn’t even wild speculation. Nobody would take their hard‐earned
money and subject themselves to trading in that fashion. Sure, you might
take a throwaway amount of money to Vegas and bet that way for a week-
end, but before you go you tell yourself, “When this is gone, I’m done.” You
expect to lose it all. It’s part/most of the entertainment.
Let’s take the same trading scenario and do what a trader, not a gam-
bler, would do to determine how much to risk each trade. Our winning
percentage is 60 percent, and we get $1 for every $1 bet when we win.
Let’s vary the bet size from 1 percent to 20 percent per trade and look at the
outcomes. The results are shown in Table 10.1.
TABLE 10.1 Traders Money Management for Gambling Scenario
Average Max
Percent of Equity Average Percent Draw‐Down Max draw‐Down

20* 4,866 77.3 99.6 2
* Kelly criteria recommended bet size
I don’t know about you, but I wouldn’t trade this strategy at a bet size
greater than 2 percent. And the worst one in the table, to me, is the Kelly
recommended bet‐size. One last note: As you peruse the money manage-
ment literature, you’ll run across another common statement: Never risk
more than x percent on a trade. The x percent is always less than 5, and usu-
ally between 1 and 3. Those people are traders, not gamblers.

The last bulleted theme concerns the “best” type of money management.
The ones listed here (optimal f, fixed risk, fixed size, fixed ratio) are all for-
mulas for the bet size to use, just like the Kelly criteria. We’ll look at some in
the money management chapters (Chapters 11–15), but to me the position
size is one of the least‐important elements of money management. Far more
important are things like how you manage diversification, serial correlation
of trades, whether the account size is small or large, and individual trade
risk. The method of position sizing won’t make much difference until you
address those other issues.
■ Monte Carlo Analysis: The Best Way
to Determine the Ultimate Trading
Statistics of a Strategy
Monte Carlo analysis has proven useful in myriad scientific and analytical
studies. A number of trading‐related books and web sites have used it as
a means of finding the ultimate trading statistics of a strategy based on a
sample of trades. Can this be done? I don’t think so, but certainly not in the
simplistic way most are doing it.
Most Monte Carlo trading simulations take a number of hypothetical
trades, put the results in a file and then randomly pull them out
one‐by‐one to form a trade sequence. The trade sequence is used to build
an equity curve, and statistics like return, draw‐down, and flat‐time are
computed. This process is done hundreds or even thousands of times,
and summary statistics can be generated from the entire set of runs.
Summary statistics might include largest return, largest draw‐down,
average largest draw‐down, probability of an x percent return, and prob-
ability of an x percent draw‐down. The problem with this simplistic ap-
proach is explained here.
We’ve seen (in Chapter 2) that it takes thousands of trades to get away
from curve‐fitting. By the same logic, you can’t define the ultimate distribu-
tion of those thousands of trades with a sample of 20 trades taken in real
time. The 20 trades that unfolded under the watchful eye of real time could
have been a spectacularly successful trading period, or a representative trad-
ing period, or a spectacularly bad period. Yet these Monte Carlo simulations
are assuming that it represents the underlying distribution of the way this
strategy will trade forever. Obviously, this situation represents “garbage in/
garbage out.”

160
EROL
GNIDART
Suppose the analyst actually waits until there are thousands of trades ei-
ther by using the development trade sample, or actually waiting for years
until there are thousands of real‐time trades. Obviously this is a better situa-
tion. But will it yield meaningful statistics? Still, probably not. One reason is
that when you pull a trade randomly, you’re getting one number: the profit
or loss from that trade. As we’ve seen, the wart of mid‐ to longer‐term
trend‐following is open‐equity give‐back. Your trade runs up to $8,000 of
profit, but you only net $4,000 for the trade; you had an open‐equity give‐
back of $4,000. This aspect of the trade is totally missing from the Monte
Carlo analysis. That missing $4,000 is draw‐down your simulation doesn’t
count in its statistics. Missing, too, is the fact that you enter x trades a day,
on average, but sometimes you enter four times as many, and sometimes
you don’t get any entries for days/weeks/months. That effect is also missing
from the analysis.
I don’t know of any Monte Carlo package for trading, that addresses the
two issues above in a proper manner, but I will admit that the capability ex-
ists for someone to do it. Would a Monte Carlo analysis that used thousands
of trades, used the whole trading sequence for a trade, and appropriately
modeled trading frequency yield a meaningful simulation? Still, probably
not, for two reasons.
The reason that sometimes there are a number of trades in a day isn’t
totally random, like our Monte Carlo analysis engine assumes. Sometimes
there are a slew of trades because a trading group like the metals or energies
gets good/bad news and the whole group heads north/south. It is likely that
trades in the same group triggered on or near the same day will have the same
trade outcome: all small winners, or all large winners, or all small losers,
or all large losers. This effect is not modeled. The Monte Carlo might take
x trades, but one will be an oats trade in 1983 and the other a coffee trade
in 2011, when they should be from the same group and the same day. Those
who think these shortcomings don’t apply to stock systems should consider
the long‐only stock strategy developed so far in Chapters 4 through 6.
When the market was crumbling in September through December 2008,
the vast majority of the “enter on weakness” trades from the strategy would
be losers, and large losers at that. And trades might be triggered in nearly
every one of our Nasdaq 100 basket stocks when the market opens down
300 to 500 Dow points. The Monte Carlo analysis engine won’t capture
the severity and duration of that period. It is highly likely that the trading
statistics in our back‐test for that period would be far worse than any Monte
Carlo analysis could predict.

Lastly, the effects of money management can’t be captured by a Monte
Carlo analysis. We haven’t discussed money management yet in this book,
but it harnesses the raw power of your trading strategy and makes it more
tradeable than if you took every trade signaled. A simple example will help.
Suppose you have a trading system that intra‐day trades soybeans, crude oil,
and the yen. Suppose the basic strategy generates, on average, two trades
per day in each of the three commodities. You’ve diligently developed the
strategy and are convinced it’s minimally curve‐fit. You’ve found in your
money management analysis that if you take a max of one trade per day
in each commodity, your equity curve is much smoother and your draw‐
downs are much smaller. (The reason why this is so doesn’t matter for this
discussion, but it’s probably true because of serial correlation in the trade
stream of each individual commodity: winners on a given day beget other
winners that day, while losers lead to other losers.) In any event, the Monte
Carlo engine sees a max of three trades per day and randomly selects each
day’s trades. Sometimes, it will have three trades in one commodity, and
sometimes it will have one in each commodity. Your money management
rules are often violated. Since your money management rules were put in
place for a better trading solution, the fact that they are ignored in the Mon-
te Carlo analysis means that, on average, the Monte Carlo results will be
worse than they should be.
If you do your development correctly for both your trading strategy and
your money management overlay, the statistics of that development are your
best estimate of what you’ll experience going forward. Sure, “your largest
draw‐down is always in the futures,” but those development statistics are
probably a better indication of what that might be than any Monte Carlo
analysis. In my opinion, Monte Carlo analysis tells you nothing useful be-
yond your development statistics.
■ Artificial Data
If we had unlimited data for something we wanted to trade, the develop-
ment process would be simple. We don’t, and so we’re stuck doing the best
we can with what’s available. A number of authors have suggested that a way
around this problem is to create synthetic data. The most common approach
is to take the existing data stream for a trading instrument and create a se-
quence based on the difference between today’s close and yesterday’s close.
That difference stream is placed on a file and randomly sampled to create a

162
EROL
GNIDART
sequential stream of differences data that can be used to create the artificial
closing price data. This approach has flaws that are similar to those of the
Monte Carlo analysis.
First, it assumes that the data difference we randomly pick today has
nothing to do with the data difference before and after it. This is just not
the case. It’s easy to show the serial relationship of sequential data by
correlating the data stream with the same data stream, but lagged one or
more places. If you correlate a data stream with itself without a lag, you
will get a correlation coefficient of 1 as the result. If you slide the data
stream one place to the left (a lag of 1) and correlate the original stream
with the lagged stream, you will get an answer ranging from ‐1 to 1. If
the answer is 0, then the two data streams are uncorrelated and the dif-
ference that occurs today doesn’t influence what will happen tomorrow.
If that were the case, then the Monte Carlo practice of making artificial
data from randomly generated differences would be valid (if that were the
only problem with the approach). Let’s make some runs and see if there
is serial correlation. Using some stocks and commodities, the data differ-
ences streams were lagged up to 20 times and a correlation coefficient
found between the lagged data and the original stream. Table 10.2 shows
the max correlation coefficient and the number of days before there was
a sign change for negative to positive or vice versa, signifying that the two
streams were not correlated beyond that point.

In every case, there was a perceptible negative correlation in the lagged
data that lasted over two weeks. The negative correlation means that up clos-
es are followed by down closes, and down closes are followed by up closes,
to a slight degree. This is in line with stocks acting in a counter‐trend man-
ner, and for commodities, it jives with the day‐of‐week filter we examined
(in Chapter 6), where we wait for a down day to go long or an up day to go
short.
This is not the only relationship in the trading data. Range has a short‐
lived but strong negative correlation, as shown in Table 10.3.

Corn –0.46 4 days

Table 10.3 shows significant negative range correlation that lasts between
three and five days in every tradeable tested. What this means to the trader
is that a big range day has a tendency to be followed by a quiet period, and a
small range day followed by bigger ranges. A number of trading filters can be
built using this information. One of the most popular is to look for a break-
out following an inside day (a day where today’s smaller range is entirely
contained within yesterday’s bigger range).
These aren’t the only issues with artificial data. If you trade a basket like
the Nasdaq 100, or the basket we used to develop the futures strategy, there
will be a strong correlation between some members. For the stocks, a big
market day will see most of the Nasdaq 100 moving up or down in line
with the market. For the commodities, there is strong correlation within

164
EROL
GNIDART
each group (see Appendix B). An artificial data stream won’t capture this
important correlation effect. In fact, every data stream created this way will
be non‐correlated (correlation coefficient of 0) with every other artificially
created stream. In my opinion, artificial data is worthless.
■ Never Add to a Loser
This adage arises from the dangers of martingale betting. In games with
a near 50 percent chance of winning (like roulette, when you bet black
or red), a martingale betting strategy would increase (usually double) the
bet size with every loser. Eventually, you’ll win, and a sequence of losing
bets would end with a winner and you’d recoup your losses plus win the
original bet.
In trading, a position is taken and as it goes against you into loss, a mar-
tingale strategy would be to double‐up the position. This is called “averaging
down,” and it requires a smaller move to the upside for your entire position
to become profitable. Is this always bad?
Clearly the danger is risk of ruin if you continue to add to the loser. Even-
tually, if the position continues to move against you, you’ll get a margin call
or run out of additional trading equity. But never do it?
There may be a very sound reason to add to a loser: The increment
you’re adding on is a good trading opportunity in its own right. Forget the
original trade for a moment; if the new increment is worth trading all by
itself, why not?
Here’s an example: Suppose we test a stock scalping strategy that buys a
stock when it closes one standard deviation below its 10‐day average price.
We find something that’s tradeable, but in our development, we see that buy-
ing at two standard deviations below price is better, but it doesn’t happen as
much. Why not take the trades at one standard deviation below the average,
and if price continues to go against you and it gets down to two standard
deviations below price, add on another unit? Here’s the trade breakout for
our basket of Nasdaq 100 stocks from 2000 until the end of 2011 when we
buy a $5,000 position on the next open if the close is one standard deviation
below the 10‐day average:
Winning trades: 11,400
Losing trades: 5,138
Total profit: $619,363
Profit‐per‐trade: $37

165
TRADING
LORE
Here are the stats when we add a $5,000 unit to the position size if price
closes two standard deviations below the average:
Winning trades: 11,891
Losing trades: 4,647
Total profit: $754,658
Profit‐per‐trade: $46
In this case, the trade stats improved. Whether you’d trade it or not would
depend on the draw‐downs, but the point is it’s conceivable that adding to a
loser could lead to a better trading solution.
■ Add to Winners
This seems like a natural thing to do, and if you search the Internet, you’ll
find that some of the people who tell you to never add to loser say it’s actu-
ally the right thing to do to add to a winner. Is it?
Adding to a winner has one inherent problem: You’re “averaging down”
your winning position. If you’re ahead $500 when you add on and the
trade then goes down $300 from there, you’ll be down $100 on the aggre-
gate position, but you’d still be up $200 if you hadn’t added on. The only
reason you’d do that is if the increment you’re adding on has a probability
of making more than the original signal. Otherwise, you’d have just traded
two units on the original signal. I’ve never seen a continuation signal that’s
more powerful than a properly designed entry signal into a trend. That’s
not to say one couldn’t exist, but it doesn’t make sense to be able to get
into the trade later in the trend and make more than an entry already in
the trend.
Note that I’m not discounting short‐, medium‐, and longer‐term
strategies independently taking a position and exiting on their own
rules as the trend strengthens. I’m talking about adding to a winner at
some profit increment of the original strategy with the same exit rules
in place.
■ Nobody Ever Got Hurt Taking a Profit
I’m not a psychologist, but after trading for over 30 years and talking to
thousands of traders, I know the feelings that go with experiencing equity
run‐up and equity draw‐down. When you’re in run‐up, you’re in a state of

166
EROL
GNIDART
euphoria. Everything about life is rosy. That feeling influences you to make
the following trading mistakes:
Letting the few losers you have run past their exit points. (“Everything is
■
working; I’m a trading genius; those losers will come back.”)
Putting on too much size. (“I’m supposed to do one contract, but every-
■
thing is working; I’m a genius; I’m doing two and if the trade starts well
I might add another.”)
In short, you deviate from your plan by overtrading.
When you’re in draw‐down, you’ve got the blues. Everyone and every-
thing are out to get you. You tend to make these trading mistakes:
Bypass or delay trade entry. (“This trade looks risky and everything’s go-
■
ing against me; I’m going to wait and see how it starts off before I take a
position.”)
Undersizing positions. (“I know I’m supposed to do two lots, but every-
■
thing’s going against me; I’m going to step into the trade and start with
only one contract.”)
Taking profits prematurely. (“I’m losing almost every trade; everything’s
■
going against me; this trade is in profit; I’m cashing it in; nobody ever got
hurt taking a profit.”)
I’m convinced this trading maxim is due to people in draw‐down trying
to justify a trading mistake to themselves.
The only way out of draw‐down is to trade your plan and wait for win-
ners to build back your equity. Going into a defensive crouch will only lead
to smaller profits when things turn around and delay your recovery.
Overtrading while you’re in run‐up only means that draw‐down, when it
inevitably comes, will be deeper than it should have been. You’ve spent a lot
of time building a plan you’re willing to put real dollars behind to trade in
real time. Trade that plan.
■ Thirty Trades Are Enough
When I do seminars, I always start with curve‐fitting material like I present-
ed in Chapter 2. Invariably, someone brings up that a trading expert has said,
“30 trades is enough” history to characterize a trading system. They’re right.
I’ve seen statements like that at least five times in print, and some of the

167
TRADING
LORE
people who made the statements really know their stuff. What the experts
are confusing is the difference between actually characterizing a distribution
and testing the distribution. Most statisticians will tell you that some mini-
mum number of samples is needed before you can do certain tests on the
data, like standard deviation t‐tests or z‐tests. The number most often used
is 30 samples. That doesn’t mean 30 samples are enough to tell you all about
the underlying distribution. Here’s an example that should make this clear.
Suppose you pulled 30 pairs of socks out of a big barrel and 15 were black
and 15 were white. You’d probably be pretty confident that the barrel was
filled about half and half with black and white socks.
If your computer has 16‐bit color, there are 65,536 different true colors.
Suppose a barrel was filled with some random number of socks for each color.
After 30 sock pulls, would you have any idea of the distribution? Of course not.
You couldn’t even know all the colors in the barrel until at least 65,536 draws.
The last example is like trading. Trades range from large losers to large
winners. You can’t define the distribution statistics with a small subset of
trades.
■ The best system statistic is:
Sharpe ratio
■
Winning trade percentage
■
Profit factor
■
Ulcer index, Calmar ratio
■
Everyone’s got their favorite set of metrics, but a good metric must in-
clude some measure of both risk and reward. Things like profit‐per‐trade
and winning trade percentage only tell you part of the story. You need some
measure of risk for context. But even metrics that incorporate risk and re-
ward have flaws; the Nobel prize–winning Sharpe ratio isn’t perfect. Jack
Schwager pointed out four problems with the Sharpe ratio in his classic
book, A Complete Guide to the Futures Markets. So what should you use?
I think the best metric really isn’t a metric; it’s a picture: the equity
curve—the old, “a picture is worth 1,000 words.” You can tell at a glance
if something’s worth trading by looking at its equity growth. Figure 10.1
shows four equity curves that have the same profit, and all but the last have
the same max draw‐down over the one‐year period being shown. What do
you think of each one?

168

Equity Curve 2

Equity Curve 4
FIGURE 10.1 Four Equity Curves
Equity Curve 1 is probably the product of a strategy that trades a num-
ber of diff erent instruments, and doesn’t take big risks per trade or have a
large open‐equity give‐back. There are relatively long periods of draw‐down
when the strategy isn’t working optimally, but it’s a pretty steady ride.
Equity Curve 2 trades very infrequently with a relatively long period of
time between the trades, and the trades either make or lose a relatively large
amount. This would be a harder strategy to trade through, and a couple of
large loses in a row could be disaster.
Equity Curve 3 shouts: “Danger, Will Robinson!” The constant up‐sloping
periods of the equity curve are due to a lot of short‐term profi table trades,
probably a scalping strategy just like our stock strategy. But the sharp V’s be-
tween the up‐slopes show that the money management used is a martingale
type. Trades are doubled up, or tripled up, and so forth until they recover.
When they do recover, all or most of the loss is recovered. This type of strat-
egy will eventually go bust.
Equity Curve 4 is trading nirvana. The only equity curve you’ll see like
that is a bond or fi xed-interest investment, but the amount you make will
be relatively small.
When you look through trading magazines or investigate trading prod-
ucts on the Internet, note that there are very few that show equity curves.

169
TRADING
LORE
They’ll claim 90 percent winners, or average trades of 5 percent, or show
charts with bars in red for short trades and bars in blue for long trades to
show how effective their signals are, but very few show composite equity
curves. In all likelihood the reason is that equity curves don’t lie. You can
spot in an instant whether a strategy is worth trading or not. The next time
someone tries to tout their product to you, ask to see an equity curve.
■ Buy the Dogs of the Dow
The Dogs of the Dow is a strategy that is centered on dividends. At the
start of the year, an investor spreads his or her money out equally over the
10 Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA or Dow) stocks that have the larg-
est dividend as a percentage of price. Portfolio re‐balance is done annually.
Various Internet sources show that the strategy consistently outperforms
the market as a whole. But when you consider the fact that stocks are best
traded as counter‐trend instruments, a price‐based Dogs strategy needs to
be examined.
Taking the Dow 30 stock list as it existed at the end of 2011, split and
dividend adjusted stock files were created for each stock going back to 1980
(only 18 of those 30 stocks were trading in 1980). Then baseline buy‐and‐
hold performance was computed by equally investing in each Dow stock on
the open of the first trading day of the month and cashing in all the shares at
the close of the last trading day of the month. The equity at the end of the
month was again equally invested across the stocks the next trading morn-
ing, and the process was continued through the end of 2011.
Next, the following Dogs strategy was run:
On the open of the first trading day of the month, equally invest in all
■
Dow stocks whose close on the last trading day of the month was less than
the close five days previous.
Close out all trades at the close of the last trading day of the month.
■
Reinvest and close monthly trades each month through the end of 2011.
■
Table 10.4 shows the annual results for both trading approaches since
1980.
You may note that the returns for buy and hold don’t match your recollec-
tion of what happened to the Dow in a given year. In 2011 for example, the
DJIA was up 5.53 percent while the buy‐and‐hold analysis shows a return

Average 17.8 23.3
of only 3.8 percent. Part of the difference is due to the way the DJIA is
computed. The DJIA computation does not equally weight each component
like our equally sized trades do; it is formed by adding the prices of each
component and dividing by the “Dow Divisor.” Thus, high‐priced stocks that
move a small percentage up may add more Dow points then lower‐priced

171
TRADING
LORE
stocks that have a bigger percentage move but advance less in price. Another
difference is that the DJIA changes are annual percentage changes, while the
two buy strategies compound returns monthly.
The Dogs strategy averages 5.5 percent more per year than the buy‐and‐
hold strategy. That might not seem like a lot, put if you started with $10,000
in 1980 and compounded the yearly returns for the two strategies, you’d
wind up with just over a $1,300,000 using buy‐and‐hold while the Dogs
strategy would have grown the equity to just over $5,000,000—quite a dif-
ference. These are some other points Table 10.4 raises:
Buying the Dogs each month outperforms the buy‐and‐hold strategy by
■
over 30 percent annually.
The Dogs strategy had three losing years in the 32‐year period, while the
■
buy‐and‐hold strategy had five.
The Dogs strategy never had two losing years in a row, while buy‐and‐
■
hold had a three‐year losing stretch.
The biggest losing year for both the Dogs and the buy‐and‐hold strategies
■
was 2008, but the Dogs strategies lost over 25 percent less.
The Dogs strategy had a better year than the buy‐and‐hold strategy 23
■
out of the 32 years, over 70 percent of the time.
There are two reasons why the Dogs strategy so consistently beats buy‐
and‐hold:
1. The most obvious reason is because the Dogs strategy only trades stocks
that are in a short‐term price decline. Due to the counter‐trend nature
of stocks, those stocks are due for a snap‐back.
2. But also contributing to the out‐performance is what is not traded in
the Dogs strategy: those stocks that are in short‐term price run‐up.
The average monthly return for the Dogs strategy is 1.81 percent. The
average monthly return for the stocks that are in short‐term run‐up
is 1.25 percent. That’s an outperformance by the Dogs stocks of
0.56 percent a month. If you used margin and traded 100 percent of
your equity shorting those Dow components in short‐term run‐up,
and traded 100 percent long on those in short‐term pull‐back, you’d
make the 0.56 percent per month, on average. That compounds to a
6.9 percent annual rate—not bad in today’s interest rate environment
for a very risk‐adverse trading approach.

172

Note that a shortcoming of this analysis is the use of the Dow compo-
nents at the end of 2011 throughout the study. The use of the actual Dow
components that were active each month would have changed the results to
an unknown degree. But on the other side of the coin, both strategies were
subjected to the identical data streams.
■ The Market Trends 5/10/20/30 Percent
of the Time
If you’re a trend‐follower, your strategy should make good money when the
market trends and get chopped up a bit when it doesn’t. Most people who
comment on “market trendiness” say markets trend less than 50 percent of
the time. I’ve seen 30 percent in print a number of times. In this section,
we’ll look at a simple way to get a gauge on market trendiness.
Welles Wilder developed a method to measure market directional move-
ment in his classic book, New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems. Here’s what
he said about his method: “Certainly one of my most satisfying achieve-
ments was the day I was actually able to reduce this concept (directional
movement) to an absolute mathematical equation.” His Average Directional
Movement Index (ADX) logic is coded in every analysis package I know off.
Let’s look at trendiness in commodities using ADX.
A basket of 56 commodities that included members of the grain, meat,
metal, energy, soft, currency, and financial commodities was used with data
going back to 1980, if the commodity traded that long. Trendiness was mea-
sured by computing the ADX for each market each day over some number of
bars, and then counting the number of times the ADX value was greater than
20. That number was divided by the number of trading days to determine the
percentage of the time the market was trending, according to the ADX metric.
Table 10.5 shows the results for 14‐, 20‐, 40‐, and 80‐day ADX calculations.
As you scan down the columns, you’ll note that the percentages, by year,
for the 14‐day and 20‐day ADX are fairly consistent, while the 40‐day and
80‐day columns vary considerably from year to year. You can interpret these
numbers to mean that shorter‐term trends are relatively plentiful and happen
consistently from year to year, while longer‐term trends can be few and far
between. Additionally, the period from 2000 on has been particularly hard for
longer‐term trend‐following. In those 12 years, there were only three years
where the 40‐day and 80‐day trends were above average. At the same time,
14‐day and 20‐day trendiness was above average seven out of the 12 years.

■ Conclusion
The message in this chapter is the same as that in the last: Don’t rely on what
others say, what you hear, or what is in print. If you have doubts, structure
a way to see if the claim is true. Most of the things I’ve learned about trad-
ing have been discovered by accident. I test something interesting and find
something else that works, or works so poorly that doing the opposite is the
way to go.

CHAPTER 11
Introduction
to Money
Management
I
n Chapters 4, 5, and 6, we went through a development process that resulted
175
in two trading strategies: a short‐term scalping strategy for stocks, and a
longer‐term trend‐following strategy for commodities. I discussed the benefits
of developing strategies with a limited money management step integrated into
the process. When the strategies are fully developed, they still aren’t ready for
trading. Another step must be taken to tailor the strategy to the account size to
be traded, and the risk/reward appetite of the trader. That step answers ques-
tions such as these: What instruments should you trade? How much size do
you trade? At what point should you increase your number of instruments, or
size? And under what conditions do you cut back market exposure? These is-
sues fall in the realm of money management. The purpose of this chapter is to
introduce two money management concepts: position sizing, and small versus
large account trading. Then, in the next four chapters, we will develop specific
money management solutions for our stock and commodity strategies.
■ Sizing Techniques
Most of the money management literature concerns position sizing. Vari-

are two general types of sizing techniques. The fi rst maintains a fi xed size
throughout the trading. This is the method we used in your system devel-
opment when we used a $5,000 stock position at each signal for our stock
scalping strategy, and one‐lot commodity position for our trend‐following
strategy. When you use a fi xed size for trading, equity growth is linear. If
you make $10,000 a year and start with $50,000, at the end of fi ve years
your equity would be $100,000. Note that in the fi rst year, your return was
20 percent ($10,000/$50,000), but in the last year your return was only
11.1 percent ($10,000/$90,000). For this reason the appropriate return
metric is dollars per year, not percent. And the appropriate draw‐down
metric is dollar draw‐down, not percent draw‐down.
The second general form of sizing techniques scales position size as the
account changes. In the previous example, where 20 percent was the re-
turn the fi rst year, size would be scaled up so the 20 percent return per
year is maintained. At the end of fi ve years, the equity would be just under
$125,000 and the return each year would have been 20 percent. In this case
equity is rising exponentially. Figure 11.1 shows the equity run‐up for the
two strategies.

So what are some of the sizing techniques that let you take advantage of
the exponential growth? We will look at some techniques using the com-
modity strategy that was fi nished in Chapter 6 . That strategy had 7,113
trades and averaged $387 per trade.

INTRODUCTION

MONEY
MANAGEMENT
Optimal F
Optimal f is a sizing method popularized by Ralph Vince in money man-
agement books of the early 1990s. His method is an offshoot of the Kelly
criterion and seeks to grow equity at an optimal rate. He actually developed
the methodology much earlier than the book publication dates, as it was
the sizing method used by Larry Williams when he ran $10,000 to over
$1,000,000 in a 1982 trading contest. Like the Kelly criterion, optimal f
does not look to manage risk. It is strictly concerned with growing equity
as fast as possible.
To use the optimal f sizing strategy, the following steps must be taken:
Using the entire sequence of trades, the optimal f trading point must be
■
found. This point can be located in a number of ways, but the simplest
is by brute force. You vary the optimal f fraction from 0.01 to 1.00 in
steps of 0.01 until you find the point that maximizes the terminal wealth
relative (TWR). The TWR is the product of the individual trade returns
as a fraction of the largest loss when traded at a size of the fraction f. An
example will clarify. Suppose your strategy has made 10 trades and the
biggest loser was $1,000. An individual trade return would be:
Individual trade return = (1 + f * (trade profit/biggest loss))
So if the first trade made $400, and you were using an f value of 0.5,
the trade return would be 1.20. That’s a 20 percent profit on a starting
value of 1. If the first trade lost $400, the trade return would be 0.80,
which is a 20 percent loss on a starting value of 1. When all the individual
trade returns are multiplied together, you have the TWR value for that f
value. The optimal f value is the f value that yields the largest TWR.
Once you have the optimal f value, you can determine the optimum trade
■
sizing by dividing the largest loss by the optimal f fraction. If optimal f
turned out to be 0.25 in our 10‐trade example, we would divide the larg-
est loss of $1,000 by 0.25 to get $4,000. To trade at optimal f, we would
trade one contract for each $4,000 in our account.
A byproduct of the analysis is the geometric mean return (GMR) for
■
the strategy. The GMR is the nth root of the TWR at the optimal f point
where n is the number of trades. Vince claims that this is a measure of
how good this strategy is at building wealth when a compounding money
management sizing technique such as optimal f is used. I have tried to

178

verify this claim, but there are issues. The main problem is that the only
number used for a trade is its profit or loss. It could have started out with
a huge loss and ended up a big winner, or it could have had a large open‐
equity give‐back at the end. Neither of these trade problems would show
up in the calculations. I think the gain‐to‐pain ratio on an equity curve
that includes the profit or loss of every trade for every bar is a better way
to measure the worth of a strategy.
Using the commodity strategies’ 7,113 trades, Table 11.1 summarizes the
pertinent “brute force” runs used to determine the optimal f trading point.
TABLE 11.1 Brute Force Results when Looking for Optimal F.
Fraction f TWR $ GMR

0.89 6.41e+53 1.01757

0.93 6.96e+53 1.01758
0.94 6.18e+53 1.01756
* Optimal f point
This table shows that trading at a fraction of 0.91 yields the highest TWR,
$7.53e+53—a staggering amount of money. Across the 7,113 trades, the
largest losing trade was $9,783. Dividing the largest loser by the opti-
mal f amount of 0.91, we see that we should trade one contract for every
$10,750.55 of equity.
When I tried to build an equity curve using this sizing, the strategy went
bust after two years. Trading a contract every $10,750.55 is just too aggres-
sive. It wasn’t until I used a value of $22,000 of equity per contract that I got
a full run‐through. The statistics for that run were:
Average annual return: 358.1 percent
Average annual max draw‐down: 62.8 percent
Max draw‐down: 99.3 percent
I believe the breakdown between theory and practice is due to the
following:
Optimal f treats trades as consecutive instantaneous‐outcome events,
■
just like gambling. You play one hand, and either win or lose. There’s no

179
INTRODUCTION

change in bankroll until the play is over. In trading, account equity can
vary considerably while the trade plays out.
Optimal f places the next bet after the outcome of the current play is
■
known, and the bankroll value is again fixed. In trading, trades can go on
before the others are complete using the current bankroll amount. You
can be in a number of losing trades at a time and be way oversized relative
to the amount you would have on had the trades completed sequentially.
These points are borne out when I make the same equity run, but only
use the closed trades; the results are very close to what optimal f predicts.
The bottom line is that if you make trades one at a time and wait for the
first one to complete before entering the next, the optimal f value will hold
up much better. And if the trades are relatively short, with equity buildup
or loss during the trade period staying very small, optimal f will probably be
very accurate. Still, you will go through enormous draw‐downs.
Fixed Risk or Fixed Fractional
This approach seeks to size so that every trade has the same risk. If you’re
trading in a non‐compounding manner, the fixed risk will be a dollar
amount, like $2,000. If you’re trading to compound returns, the fixed risk
is a percent of equity, either closed equity, or open‐ plus closed‐trade equity.
The risk is based on the distance to the catastrophic stop—in other words,
the max loss potential of the trade. The following breakout contrasts the
non‐compounding and compounding approaches:
Fixed Risk, Non‐Compounding Example:
Corn trade with $200 risk per contract
Coffee trade with $1,000 risk per contract
Fixed risk of $1,500 per position
Account equity of $500,000
Solution: 7 corn contracts and 1 coffee contract (number of contracts
rounded down)
Fixed Risk, Compounding Example:
Corn trade with $200 risk per contract
Coffee trade with $1,000 risk per contract
Fixed risk of 1 percent per position
Account equity of $500,000
Solution: 25 corn contracts and 5 coffee contracts

With the non‐compounding example, you’ll note that if account equity
were $50,000 or $5,000,000, the solution would be the same.
As a non‐compounding example, let’s compare the solution we had trad-
ing our commodity system with a one‐lot at each signal versus a number of
fixed risk amounts. Table 11.2 shows the comparison.
TABLE 11.2 Comparison of Non‐Compounding Sizing Approaches
Average Annual
Average Annual Return Max Draw‐Down Max Draw‐Down
Approach (%) (%) (%) Gain‐to‐Pain Ratio
1‐Lot 85,315 34,419 74,977 2.48

$2,000 Fixed Risk 114,873 43,043 74,931 2.67
$2,250 Fixed Risk 128,978 50,314 86,543 2.56
$2,500 Fixed Risk 153,192 58,367 104,375 2.62
Table 11.2 shows that equalizing the risk across all trades can lead to
a better trading solution than buying a one‐lot at each trade. As the fixed
risk number is raised further, the gain‐to‐pain ratio steadies out to a value
of about 2.75. The variability is caused by the fractional contracts that are
dropped in the rounding process. Also, for the lower fixed risk numbers,
not all trades were taken, because the risk of even a one‐lot exceeded the
threshold of $1,500 or $2,000.
Let’s now look at the compounding fixed-risk solution for a number of
fixed-risk percentage values. Table 11.3 again uses all 7,113 trades in the
commodity strategy.

Table 11.3 raises a couple of interesting points:
The more risked per trade, the better the trading solution, as measured
■
by the gain‐to‐pain ratio. This is in contrast to the non‐compounding
fixed-risk case, where the gain‐to‐pain steadies out at sizes where frac-
tional contracts cease to be a factor.
The fixed-risk solution is better than the optimal f solution. Table 11.4
■
compares the two runs.
TABLE 11.4 Comparison of Optimal f and Fixed Risk Solutions
Average Annual

per contract 358.1 62.8 99.3 5.70
Fixed risk: 7
percent 447.2 61.5 98.8 7.27
Clearly, relating size to the risk of the trade is a better approach than
risking the same number of contracts for each trade at a given equity value:
The return and gain‐to‐pain ratios are higher, and both draw‐down metrics
are less. This approach, with small variations, is the approach most money
managers use to size their trades.
Fixed Ratio
This approach was detailed by Ryan Jones in his book, The Trading Game. The
approach increases size linearly at ever‐increasing steps of equity. The steps
increase each time by the delta amount, the amount your account equity
must grow before you resize. If you start trading a $10,000 account and
choose a delta value of $2,000, you trade one contract per trade until your
account grows to $12,000. At that point the step is increased by the delta
value to $4,000, and two contracts per trade are taken. Then when the ac-
count reaches $16,000, you can trade three contracts.
You can see from the way contracts are added that the biggest risk is as-
sumed early on. If each trade has a $500 risk, you start out risking $500 on a
$10,000 account, or 5 percent. When the account hits the value of $12,000
and you’re trading two contracts, the risk is 8.3 percent. At $16,000 and 3
contracts, the risk is 9.375 percent. At the next level, the risk decreases to
9.09 percent and continues to decrease from that point on. If you averaged
$300 per trade and made 1,000 trades, at the end of the sequence, you’d

182

only be risking less than 0.4 percent a trade, not even one‐tenth of the level
you started at. You’ll also note that the smaller the delta value, the greater
the risk. Using a delta of $1,000, the risk peaks at 12.5 percent per trade at
four contracts, versus the peak of 9.375 percent at three contracts for the
case where delta is $2,000.
Using our commodity strategy, Table 11.5 shows the results when trading
at a variety of delta values.
TABLE 11.5 Fixed Ratio Trading at Various Delta Levels
Average Annual Return Average Annual Max Draw‐Down Max Draw‐Down
Delta (%) (%) (%) Gain‐to‐Pain Ratio
$ 1,000 28.8 18.8 56.7 1.53
$ 2,000 26.2 16.2 47.6 1.61
$ 3,000 24.7 14.8 42.5 1.67
$ 5,000 22.8 13.2 36.3 1.73
$10,000 20.3 11.2 28.7 1.81
$20,000 18.0 9.4 22.3 1.91
$30,000 16.7 8.4 19.1 1.99
This is a compounding approach, but the gain‐to‐pain ratios are lower
than the two non‐compounding approaches we looked at (one‐lot trading
and fixed risk). This solution doesn’t come close to competing with the
compounding fixed-risk approach. I think the problem is the very unequal
approach to risk. At the start of a run the risk per trade is many times what
it is at the end. Since you never know when draw‐down will hit, why risk
way more at any point in the trade stream?
Sizing Summary
There’s a reason most money managers use a fixed-risk trading approach.
It’s because it is a very fast way to build equity, and risk is equalized on ev-
ery position by the sizing. Additionally, you can tailor the risk level so that
draw‐down is within your risk tolerance envelope. Given the equity buildup
advantage of compounding equity versus a non‐compounding approach, you
may wonder why anyone would consider using a fixed size for trading. The
answer is that no one probably would unless they have to. But the fact of the
matter is, most traders have to. The reason is that their account size is too
small to see the benefits of variable sizing.

183
INTRODUCTION

MANAGEMENT
■ Small versus Large Account Size
The best traditional money management sizing approach I know is to risk a
small percentage of equity on each trade. But sometimes your account size
won’t let you do that. If you’re trading commodities and your system has a
$1,000 stop, the risk for one trade on a $10,000 account is 10 percent. That’s
not a small risk to take on one trade. A small account is then defined as one
that cannot be traded risking a small fixed percentage of equity on each trade.
This point illustrates the important difference between small‐account
and large‐account traders: Small‐account traders are forced to take greater
relative risk than large‐account traders. Small‐account traders are always a
small number of adverse trades away from a margin call, while large‐account
traders who risk a small percentage of equity on each trade are always a very
large number of adverse trades away from a margin call.
Because a small‐account trader is on the edge, money management is cru-
cial to success. It should be the aim of every small‐account trader to grow his
equity to large‐account status so he can enjoy the benefits of large‐account
trading. Besides walking in from the edge, the large‐account trader enjoys
money management strategies not available to the small‐account trader. In
the remainder of this chapter, the appropriate performance metrics will be
detailed for small accounts and large accounts.
Small‐Account Performance Metrics
There are many ways to measure the success of a trading system and the
money management strategies used in trading it. The best methods seek to
measure both return and risk. Small‐account traders should be most con-
cerned with risk because that is what will drive them from the game. In this
section, three measures of risk will be examined: open‐ and closed‐trade
draw‐down, closed‐trade draw‐down, and start‐trade draw‐down. Most
traders use draw‐down as a measure of the capital required to trade a given
methodology. The maximum historical draw‐down (sometimes multiplied
by some factor to account for a future larger draw‐down) plus margin re-
quirements are deemed the requirements to successfully trade the method-
ology. As will be shown, the conventional open‐ and closed‐trade draw‐down
metric is really meaningless to the small‐account trader. That’s because it
inflates the risk associated with trading a system and a given money manage-
ment strategy. The closed‐trade draw‐down is a better measure of risk, but
the best measure is a metric I’ve developed: start‐trade draw‐down. This is

184
TNEMEGANAM
YENOM
OT
NOITCUDORTNI
the draw‐down a trader can expect to see when a given system and strategy
are started.
On the reward side, annual return is a meaningful metric, but a better
metric for the small‐account trader is start‐trade return. This is the average
fi rst‐year return a trader can expect when he or she starts trading the system.
Small‐Account Metrics: Open‐ and Closed‐Trade
Draw‐Down
If the equity curve is built by taking the sum of closed‐trade equity and the
profi ts/losses in all open positions, the resultant equity curve is an open‐ and
closed‐trade equity curve. Open‐ and closed‐trade equity corresponds to the
bottom‐line fi gure on your brokerage statement each day. If a system and money
management strategy are traded for a length of time, the resultant open‐ and
closed‐trade equity curve can be examined for draw‐downs. A draw‐down is
defi ned as a peak‐to‐trough equity drop, as shown in Figure 11.2 .
Figure 11.2 shows a number of draw‐downs. The largest is used by many
traders as a measure of the reserves above margin requirements needed to trade

the strategy. For strategies that use trend‐following systems, this is usually not
true. A large part of the draw‐down can be due to open‐equity profit retrace-
ment. To illustrate this, suppose that the graph is not the result of a number of
trades, but the result of one trade. In that case, you got in the trade, had a draw‐
down of $1,000, built up to a trade profit of $4,000, had another draw‐down
of $2,000, built up an additional $3,000 of profit over the initial peak, and then
ended the trade with a $3,000 draw‐down to cash out the trade with a $4,000
profit. As a small‐account trader, the worst position you were in was at the start
when you went $1,000 below your starting equity (the start‐trade draw‐down
for this trade). The biggest draw‐down of $3,000 was out of open‐equity profits.
It hurt to give back that $3,000, but that $3,000 draw‐down had nothing to do
with the minimum capital required to execute the trade. The capital required
was start‐trade draw‐down ($1,000) plus the margin requirements.
Thus, open‐ and closed‐trade draw‐down figures can be misleading to
a small‐account trader. Using that draw‐down figure plus margin require-
ments as the minimum required to trade the strategy will usually overstate
the equity required.
Small‐Account Metrics: Closed‐Trade
Draw‐Down
A closed trade equity curve is formed by adding the profit/loss from each
trade as it ends to the previous equity, and plotting the result on the date
the trade is liquidated. This draw‐down figure will not include open‐equity
profit retracement since the trade results are not added to equity until the
day the trade ends, but it also neglects to show if a winning trade was ever
in a losing position. Since open‐equity retracement on good trades can be
much larger than the negative segments of winning trades, closed‐trade
draw‐down is a better reflection of the reserves needed to trade a strategy,
but it still isn’t exactly what the small‐account trader is interested in.
Small‐Account Metrics: Start‐Trade Draw‐Down
This is the risk metric that the small‐account trader should be most interested
in. It is found by looking at the open‐ and closed‐trade equity curve and find-
ing the lowest equity point below the starting equity. In the equity curve in
Figure 11.2, the start‐trade draw‐down would be $1,000. This is the figure a
small‐account trader is interested in because it, plus margin requirements, is
the amount an account must have in starting equity to trade the methodology

successfully, if the trader started trading at the start of the equity run. If an eq-
uity curve is generated at the start of each trade in the methodologies’ hypo-
thetical history, all the start‐trade draw‐downs can be found. Thus, if there were
200 trades in the methodology back‐testing, 200 equity curves would be gener-
ated and the start‐trade draw‐down for each one found. This is extremely useful
information to the small‐account trader, because the largest start‐trade draw‐
down can be found, as well as statistics on the entire start‐trade draw‐down
distribution. The following example will illustrate the usefulness of start‐trade
draw‐down and contrast it with the other two draw‐down metrics.

Notice that the closed‐trade draw‐down fi gures correspond better to the
start‐trade average yearly and maximum results than the open‐ and closed‐
trade draw‐down fi gures. It is also evident that the open‐ and closed‐trade
draw‐down fi gures well overstate the amount required to trade this portfolio.
Byproducts of the start‐trade analysis are two useful start‐trade graphs.
These graphs show the distribution of all the start‐trade draw‐downs and one‐
year profi ts over the portfolio’s history. Figure 11.4 shows an example of these
distributions for the portfolio example used to illustrate draw‐down.

First-Year Start-Trade Profit
Probability First-Year Profit Is Less Than
Looking at the draw‐down graph (top), the x‐axis is the cumulative
percentage probability of occurrence, and the y‐axis is the draw‐down.
Entering at 70 percent, intersecting the plot, and reading over to the left,

we see that there is a 60 percent probability that a trader will experience
a $7,400 or less start‐trade draw‐down when this portfolio is traded.
The profit graph (bottom) is read the same way. A trader has a 10 percent
chance his first‐year profits will be $31,500 or less; conversely, he has a
90 percent chance they will be $30,500 or more.
These graphs are powerful tools the small‐account trader can use to gauge
risk and reward when deciding what trading plan to implement.
Large‐Account Performance Metrics
Where the small‐account trader should be most interested in start‐trade
draw‐down as a survival metric, the large‐account trader should be more
interested in the reward he can receive for the risk he takes. An appropri-
ate risk measure is the percentage of draw‐down, both largest and annual,
while annual percent return is a good return metric.
Large‐Account Performance Metric: Percentage
of Draw‐Down
The open‐ and closed‐trade equity curve is used to yield the draw‐down per-
cent. As before, the peak‐to‐trough is the draw‐down, but rather than use
the dollar draw‐down, a percentage is formed by dividing the draw‐down
dollar amount by the peak equity amount at the start of the draw‐down.
The largest percent draw‐down is one useful metric, and another is
formed by finding the n‐largest percentage draw‐downs and dividing by n. If
n is the number of years in the equity curve, this metric can be interpreted
as the average max annual percentage draw‐down, even though some years
had more than one of the historical draw‐downs, and some none.
Large‐Account Performance Metric: Annual
Percent Return
One way to compute the average annual percent return is to take the start-
ing and ending equity, and compute the average annual percent return using
the following formula:
⎛ ⎞ 1
endingequity
Annualreturn =⎜ ⎟ years
⎝startingequity⎠

189
INTRODUCTION
TO
MONEY
MANAGEMENT
Another useful way to compute annual percent return is to compute the
percent return for each individual return year and average the results. Note
that the results of the two methods will probably differ. If, for example, an
account started at $100,000, ended the first year at $100,000, and ended
the second year at $400,000, the annual percent return formula will yield
100 percent because on average the account doubled each year. But com-
puting the annual return using the yearly returns, you’d see a 150 percent
return (no gain the first year and 300 percent the second year).
■ Conclusion
This chapter introduced two money management concepts: position sizing,
and the significant difference between small‐account trading and large‐
account trading. Chapter 12 and Chapter 14 will be devoted to finding
small-account money management and large‐account money management
solutions for our commodity system. Chapter 13 and Chapter 15 will do the
same for our stock system. In those chapters a variety of money manage-
ment techniques will be explored to further enhance the tradeability of our
strategies.

n this chapter, small account money management techniques will be illus-
trated using the commodity strategy developed in Chapters 4 through 6.
Then, specific money management rules will be developed for account sizes
ranging from $20,000 to $100,000.
It is important to remember that small‐account traders should be most
concerned about limiting risk. The techniques presented in this chapter all
look to limit risk but some, when applied to a given strategy, won’t increase
the gain‐to‐pain metric. That doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be adopted as
part of your trading solution. Look at the risk reduction they offer as the
final arbiter of whether they should be used or not.

■ Diversification
To minimize risk, it is best to trade a number of independent commodities.
Commodities are independent of each other if there is no tendency for one
to rise or fall when the other does. Dependent commodities, such as those
within a commodity group, tend to move in tandem. If trading capital limits
the number of commodities that can be traded simultaneously, avoid trading
a number of commodities from the same group. If a draw‐down starts in
one, it is likely to occur in the others.
The following example will highlight this point. Looking at the historical
performance of the commodities in our Donchian commodity strategy, the
currency group has performed well. Suppose the two sets of commodities
in Table 12.1 are compared.
TABLE 12.1 Non‐Diversified versus Diversified Portfolios
Non‐Diversified Commodities Total Profit ($) Diversified Commodities Total Profit ($)
Japanese Yen 88,475 Soybeans 57,025
Swiss Franc 81,512 Feeder Cattle 25,687
Dollar Index 104,734 Cotton 100,590
Euro‐Currency 51,744 Palladium 101,279
Canadian Dollar 26,179 Crude Oil 61,059
Australian Dollar 22,470 Dollar Index 104,734
British Pound 117,225 10‐Year Notes 67,609
Mexican Peso 36,549
Total Profit 528,888 517,983
The two sets make about the same profits over the time frame from 1980
through December 2011, but the non-diversified set contains all curren-
cies, and the other a set of commodities that is nominally uncorrelated.
Building an equity curve and performing a start‐trade draw‐down analysis,
Table 12.2 shows trading results for each portfolio.
TABLE 12.2 Trading Results: Diversified versus Non‐Diversified Portfolios
Portfolio Average Start‐Trade Draw‐Down ($) Max Start‐Trade Draw‐Down ($)
Non‐Diversified 4,305 19,017
Diversified 3,203 14,998
These results illustrate the diversification advantage. The average max
draw‐down is about 25 percent lower in the diversified set, and the maximum
draw‐down is about 20 percent less than the non‐diversified portfolios’, but

193
COMMODITIES
the total profit is about the same. Diversification is a powerful money man-
agement technique for the small‐account trader.
■ Limiting Group Exposure,
First-N-in-a-Group Trading
A diversification tactic that the small‐account trader can use is first-N‐in‐a‐
group trading. Rather than select one commodity from each group and wait
for a signal in that commodity, select all the commodities you are willing
to trade in that group and take the first N signals that come up, where N is
the exposure your account size and risk‐taking makeup dictate. Table 12.3
shows the pertinent trade data for each of the 56 commodities in the basket.

Looking over the basket, Table 12.4 shows a breakout of the best com-
modities in each group followed by the second‐best commodities. “Best” is

195
COMMODITIES
somewhat subjective, but total profit was the base criteria with liquidity and
volatility as considerations.
TABLE 12.4 Best Commodities

Meats Feeder Cattle, N/A
Softs Cotton, Lumber
Metals Silver, Palladium

Financials 10‐Year Note, Euro Bond
First the best commodities were traded as a portfolio (baseline portfolio)
and a one‐lot trade was taken in each. Then the portfolio was augmented
(augmented portfolio) with the second-tier commodities and traded first‐
one‐in‐a‐group, meaning only one of the two commodities in each group
could be in a trade at the same time. If the second commodity in that group
signaled a trade while the first was still in a trade, that trade was bypassed.
Table 12.5 shows the results of each run.
TABLE 12.5 Diversification Example: First‐N‐in‐a‐Group
Average First‐Year Average Start‐Trade Max Start‐Trade Gain‐to‐Pain
Portfolio Return ($) Draw‐Down ($) Draw‐Down ($) Ratio
Baseline Portfolio 15,653 3,808 17,284 4.09
Augmented 19,943 3,857 20,752 5.17
Portfolio
These results show that even adding second‐tier commodities and trading
first‐in‐a‐group improves results when measured by the gain‐to‐pain ratio.
The reasons this strategy outperforms the fixed portfolio strategy are:
The benefits of diversification are enhanced since most groups will always
■
have a trade ongoing in this strategy, while a group might not be repre-
sented for a significant period of time in the fixed portfolio strategy.
More trades will be made over the same time frame, which will lead to
■
faster equity growth.
There’s one more point that can be made with these portfolios: It’s bet-
ter to diversify with second‐tier commodities than to double‐up on the
top-tier set. That point is illustrated in Table 12.6. The table compares the

196
SEITIDOMMOC
performance attained by trading two contracts at each signal with the base-
line portfolio, which contains the top‐tier commodities, versus one trade at
each signal for the augmented commodity portfolio.
TABLE 12.6 Diversification Example: Two‐Lot of Top Tier Commodities versus
One‐Lot of Augmented Portfolio
Average First‐ Average Start‐Trade Max Start‐Trade Gain‐to‐Pain
Portfolio Year Return ($) Draw‐Down ($) Draw‐Down ($) Ratio
Baseline Portfolio 31,306 7,616 34,568 4.09
Augmented Portfolio 30,263 4,003 17,180 7.56
Again, diversification is a powerful tactic for the small‐account trader. By
adding second‐tier commodities, the gain‐to‐pain ratio for the augmented
portfolio is almost 85 percent higher than the baseline portfolio when trad-
ing two lots of the best commodities in each group at each signal.
■ Limit Trade Risk on Entry
When a trade is originated, the trade risk is the distance, converted to
dollars, from the entry point to the catastrophic stop loss point; that is, the
maximum dollar amount that can be lost on the trade. Because our three-
standard-deviation stop is volatility‐based, some trades will have a relatively
small dollar risk and some a relatively large dollar risk. Using the “limit
trade risk entry” money management strategy, trades with a high trade risk
are bypassed.
Table 12.7 shows the results of bypassing trades with a catastrophic stop
value that exceeds a certain limit. All 56 commodities were used for the
analysis.
TABLE 12.7 Limit Trade Risk on Entry
Average First‐Year Average Start‐Trade Max Start‐Trade Gain‐to‐Pain
Trade Risk Limit Return ($) Draw‐Down ($) Draw‐Down ($) Ratio
All Trades 76,134 9,597 64,996 7.93
$3,000 64,257 8,255 46,652 7.78
$2,000 54,674 6,000 34,327 9.11
$1,000 24,750 3,524 23,773 7.02
The results shows that bypassing trades with an initial stop greater than
$2,000 away from the entry price increases the gain‐to‐pain ratio from the
baseline 7.93 to 9.11, a 15 percent improvement.

197
COMMODITIES
■ Limit Open-Trade Risk
At any point in time, open‐trade risk can be defined as the distance from the
current price to the stop price converted to dollars. If an open position is in
either profit or loss and its current price is $4,000 from its catastrophic stop
point, its trade risk at that point is $4,000. There is always a risk of giving part
or all of it back. This money management technique closes the trade when a
certain dollar amount of open‐trade risk is reached. Note that this can also
be looked at as a form of profit‐taking. Table 12.8 shows performance when
trades are exited if they reach a certain dollar amount of open‐trade risk.
TABLE 12.8 Limit Open‐Trade Risk
Open‐Trade Risk Average First‐Year Average Start‐Trade Max Start‐Trade Gain‐to‐Pain
Threshold for Trade Exit Return ($) Draw‐Down ($) Draw‐Down ($) Ratio
No Exit 76,134 9,597 64,996 7.93
> $10,000 71,908 8,603 9,358 8.36
> $8,000 71,334 8,118 45,983 8.78
> $6,000 61,890 7,822 49,623 8.94
> $4,000 49,021 7,365 49,021 6.66
Table 12.8 shows that exiting trades when the trade risk grows above
$6,000 is a better trading solution than the baseline, as indicted by the gain‐
to‐pain ratio of 8.94. In fact, all runs that closed trades with greater than
$6,000 of open‐trade risk outperformed the baseline.
■ Limit Total Portfolio Open-Trade Risk
At certain times, it seems like all the groups are moving together. I remember
thinking in the second half of 2008 that if I knew how one energy, or one finan-
cial, or one stock index, or one metal was going to close for the day, I’d know
how every commodity in all those groups was going to close. Times like that are
opportunities to make a fortune, or get crushed. Since a small‐account trader
must control risk to stay in the game, something should be done to limit expo-
sure when a number of groups are moving up and down together in large sweeps.
This small‐account money management technique looks at the open‐
trade risk across all ongoing trades, and if the sum of the individual open‐
trade risks exceeds a dollar limit, the trade with the largest open‐trade risk
is closed. Again, note that this technique is also a form of profit‐taking: The
trade with the largest open‐trade risk will be deeply in profit if the portfolio

198
SEITIDOMMOC
limit is hit. Table 12.9 shows the performance for a number of portfolio
open‐trade limits.
TABLE 12.9 Limit Portfolio Open‐Trade Risk
Portfolio Open‐Trade Risk Average First‐ Average Start‐Trade Max Start‐Trade Gain‐to‐Pain
Threshold for Exit of a Trade ($) Year Return ($) Draw‐Down ($) Draw‐Down ($) Ratio
No Exit 76,134 9,597 64,996 7.93
> 100,000 75,677 9,592 64,996 7.89
> 80,000 73,744 9,579 64,996 7.70
> 70,000 69,254 9,313 60,806 7.44
Limiting portfolio open‐trade risk did not improve the trading solution
in terms of the gain‐to‐pain ratio, but the risk metrics of average start‐trade
draw‐down and max start‐trade draw‐down were reduced. This technique
will be a tool we’ll try and use as we proceed to find small‐account trading
solutions for various account sizes.
■ Limit Total Number of Open Trades
As the number of open trades varies in real‐time trading, the biggest risk/
reward opportunities occur when you have a relatively large number of
trades on. This small‐account money management technique looks to limit
risk exposure by capping the number of open trades. Table 12.10 shows the
performance when the number of open trades is limited.
TABLE 12.10 Limiting the Total Number of Open Trades
Max Number of Average First‐Year Average Start‐Trade Max Start‐Trade Gain‐to‐Pain
Open Trades Return ($) Draw‐Down ($) Draw‐Down ($) Ratio
All Trades 76,134 9,597 64,996 7.93
40 75,904 9,595 64,996 7.91
30 71,253 9,471 64,996 7.52
20 56,762 8,312 55,932 6.83
Again, the gain‐to‐pain ratio was not improved by limiting the total num-
ber of open trades at a time, but look at the steady decrease in average
start‐trade draw‐down as the number of trades allowed is decreased. The
max start‐trade draw‐down also shows a healthy decrease as the number is
more severely curtailed. Another technique we’ll try to use when we build
specific trading solutions for the small account trader is limiting the number
of trades that are on at a time.

■ Fixed Portfolios
When tailoring a money management approach for small accounts, it is help-
ful to build portfolios from the bottom up rather than the top down. Start
with the best one or two commodities in each group and use small‐account
money management techniques to get the best solution you can. As equity
grows, a larger portfolio can be fashioned by building on the first, rather
than starting all over again. In this section, portfolios for various account
sizes will be presented from small to relatively large. Each portfolio uses risk
limitation, diversification across the groups, and a first‐N‐in‐a‐group trad-
ing approach. The smallest portfolio was built by selecting the lowest‐risk,
best‐performing commodities. Risk was always considered first. Successful
portfolios build on the last by adding more commodities to each group.

This portfolio can be traded with account equity ranging from
$20,000 to $40,000. An aggressive trader with account equity of
$20,000 can expect to net $18,389 in the first year of trading (average
start‐trade one‐year return). He or she should expect to see a start‐
trade draw‐down of $2,843, but it could be as high as $12,023 or more.
Sometime during the year, the trader should expect to see an open‐ and
closed‐trade draw‐down of $8,484. If the max start‐trade draw‐down
is experienced, it would be a 60 percent draw‐down from his starting
equity. For enduring the draw‐down pain, the reward is outstanding:
The average first‐year return of $18,389 is over a 90 percent return
on starting equity. With $40,000 to start, the more conservative trader
should expect this gain/pain profile:
Expected return for first year of 46 percent
■
Max start‐trade draw‐down of 30 percent
■
Average start‐trade draw‐down of 7 percent

Let’s look at the next size of portfolio, the mid‐size portfolio, for accounts
that start or grow to the point where a trader is comfortable with its risk/
reward expectations.

the smaller portfolios. This is due to greater and greater diversification. The
small‐account trader should look to move up to the next size portfolio as
soon as account equity grows to a point where he or she is comfortable with
the risk/reward profile of the bigger portfolio.

n this chapter, small-account money management techniques will be illus-
trated using the stock strategy developed in Chapters 4 through 6. A key
difference between the commodity basket and the stock basket is the lack
of a strong group structure with the stocks. Though there is a spectrum of
industries in the current Nasdaq 100, the correlation of the stocks one‐to‐
another is relatively high. The Nasdaq 100 is composed of stocks that are in
the index because they are highly liquid and they move. Thus there is very
little that can be done with diversification money management techniques.
In this chapter, specific money management rules will be developed for ac-
count sizes ranging from $20,000 to $100,000.
■ Stock Strategy Performance Metrics
In the last two chapters, start‐trade draw‐down was presented as the most
meaningful metric for small‐account traders. That is always true because
open‐trade give‐back from profitable trades is indistinguishable from los-

ing trade draw‐down. With a scalping system like the stock strategy we de-
veloped in Chapters 4 through 6, the open‐trade give‐back will be much
smaller than for a longer‐term trend‐following strategy. Maybe open‐ and
closed‐trade draw‐down, or closed‐trade draw‐down is close enough to the
actual start‐trade draw‐down statistics so that we don’t have to go through
the lengthy process of building the start‐trade statistics. To gain insight into
this issue, I used 10 stocks of the 100‐stock Nasdaq basket and built open‐
and closed‐trade equity statistics, closed trade statistics, and start‐trade sta-
tistics for comparison. The following list shows the results:
Average yearly maximum open‐ and closed‐trade draw‐down: $3,343
Average yearly maximum closed‐trade draw‐down: $3,321
Average yearly maximum start‐trade draw‐down: $3,274
Maximum open‐ and closed‐trade draw‐down: $8,148
Maximum closed‐trade draw‐down: $7,789
Maximum start‐trade draw‐down: $7,572
Notice that the average and maximum draw‐down statistics are very close
in all cases. For the development in this chapter, we will use open‐ and
closed‐trade draw‐down statistics instead of start‐trade statistics.
■ Position Sizing
Most brokerage firms allow clients 100 percent leverage when trading on
the long side, as we’re doing with our Nasdaq 100 long‐only strategy. So
with a $20,000 account, a client could control up to $40,000 in stock. Let’s
look at the return and draw‐down statistics when the strategy is traded using
a position size of $5,000 per trade and the max number of stocks held at a
time is varied from one to eight. Table 13.1 shows the trading results.

The gain‐to‐pain ratio, formed by dividing average annual profit by av-
erage annual max draw‐down, shows that carrying a max of five positions
offers the best trading solution. On the practical side, the average and max
draw‐down figures for that solution are too large for a $20,000 account; the
average max draw‐down per year exceeds 21 percent, and the max draw‐
down is over 37 percent. Let’s see if we can use other money management
techniques to reduce the risk.
■ Position Hedging
A shortcoming of our stock strategy is the fact that we only trade from the
long side. When the market turns down as it did in 2000–2001 and 2008,
most of the long trades will lose. Let’s try adding a downside hedge to the
baseline strategy. An easy way to do that is to sell short one or more $5,000
positions of a market surrogate like the exchange-traded fund (ETF) for
S&P 500 (stock symbol SPY). Since eight positions is the most we can trade
with a $20,000 account, we can carry up to three hedged positions with
our max of five long positions before we have to reduce the number of long
positions by one. Another note is that some accounts (usually retirement
accounts) are prohibited from short‐selling, so they can’t hedge in this man-
ner. There are other hedging techniques available to these accounts, such as
buying inverse ETFs or put options, so this is not a limitation of the money
management technique.
Table 13.2 shows the results when we hedge with one to three SPY positions.

** New baseline
The hedging strategy significantly helps in the draw‐down department.
With five longs and two shorts, profitability is reduced by about $450 per
year, but average max draw‐down and max draw‐down are reduced even
more. Since risk is what we’re trying to minimize in the small account, we’ll
keep the 5/2 solution as the new baseline.

It might surprise some that this hedging strategy has such a large
impact on performance. It would seem that you’re just neutralizing two
of the longs with the two shorts. The reality is that the average long
trade makes about 1 percent in two days, a compounded rate of over
250 percent a year. The SPY, on average, loses just a small fraction of
that amount.
As one last refinement, there may be times when the market is in a
severe down‐turn and the 70‐day trend filter reduces the number of
stocks that can trade to a small fraction of the total 100. Maybe the SPY
hedge shouldn’t be on when the number of trades falls below a certain
threshold? This concept was tested, and it turns out that the hedge of
two SPY positions should only be on when there are two or more active
Nasdaq 100 trades. Table 13.3 compares this new baseline solution with
the old.

This trading solution could be used for accounts ranging from $20,000 to
$40,000. For the small‐account trader with a high pain threshold a willingness
to trade it with $20,000, the following is the type of ride he or she can expect:
Average annual return: 34 percent
Average max draw‐down per year: 16 percent
Max draw‐down: 30 percent
A more conservative trader choosing to trade with $40,000 of account
equity would see half the pain and half the reward.
As the account grows, the trader can shift to better solutions. Table 13.5
shows mixes of longs and short hedges that maximize the gain‐to‐pain ratio
for a given number of long positions.

For each long/short solution, the number of indicted hedge positions
was placed only if there were that many Nasdaq long positions, or greater.
Table 13.5 indicates that as the account equity grows, better trading solu-
tions, as measured by the gain‐to‐pain ratio, are available. There is a point
(seven $5,000 SPY positions) where the number of hedge positions can’t be
increased because there aren’t enough average Nasdaq trades to increase the
gain‐to‐pain ratio.
There is a way to take advantage of the gaps between minimum account
sizes for each solution: to increase trade size from $5,000 upward for both
the long and hedge trades to maintain exposure near the max dollar com-
mitment the brokerage will allow to be traded for the account size. If you’re
trading the 5/2 solution, and account equity has grown to $25,000, and the
brokerage allows two‐to‐one leverage, you can put on $50,000 of trades
across your five longs and two shorts. Your trade size can then be just over
$7,000 a position instead of $5,000. The trader should take advantage of
these solutions as his or her account grows with the ultimate goal of building
the account to large account status.
■ Conclusion
In this chapter, we developed small‐account trading solutions for the
Donchian stock strategy. Because of the lack of a group structure, and the
high correlation among the 100 stock components, most of the small‐
account money management techniques we used with the commodity
strategy weren’t effective with the stock strategy. But hedging with short
positions in the S&P 500 SPY ETF allowed our stock strategy to have an
average annual profit greater than the max draw‐down and over twice as
large as the average annual max draw‐down.

T
he previous two chapters detailed the problems faced by the small‐
account trader. With a small account, he or she is forced to take more
relative risk than a large‐account trader. Taking a $2,000‐risk trade with
$20,000 account equity means the small‐account trader is risking 10 percent
of capital; he or she is always a small number of adverse trades away from a
margin call. A large‐account trader can employ money management tech-
niques that result in a far lower relative risk. Employing these strategies
ensures that the large‐account trader is many, many adverse trades away
from a margin call. His or her smaller relative risk can be managed to yield
a solid return.
There is also a key difference in the development of a finalized money
management overlay for the large account. In our small‐account develop-
ment, we were most concerned with limiting risk, so in some cases we
accepted a tactic that didn’t improve the quality of the trading solution as

measured by the gain‐to‐pain ratio. With large accounts, we want the best
trading solution available, so all decisions will be based on the gain‐to‐pain
ratio. At the end of development, leverage in the form of the amount risked
per trade will bring that solution to a risk level acceptable to the trader.
The large‐account trader will use some of the same money management
strategies as the small‐account trader: limit risk, diversify, and limit group
exposure. An additional technique that the large‐account trader can use is
a buy strategy that allows n‐lot trades with a small, constant risk exposure.
Before these strategies are detailed, the fixed‐risk sizing technique we will
use will be reviewed.
■ Fixed-Risk Sizing
In this money management approach, a fixed percentage of equity is risked
on each trade. It is implemented by multiplying the fixed percentage by ac-
count equity on the day of the trade to determine the dollar amount to be
risked. Then, the strategy’s trade risk is used to determine the number of
contracts that should be traded to risk the desired amount. For example, if
account size is $150,000 and the fixed percentage the trader has decided to
risk is 3 percent, $4,500 could be risked on a trade signal (0.03 multiplied
by $150,000). If the trade risk for a signal is $600 (distance to initial stop,
converted to dollars), seven contracts would be bought or sold on the signal
(a fractional number of contracts is rounded down). This example illustrates
that a sizeable account is required to implement this conservative money
management strategy; otherwise the fixed percentage of equity will be too
small to support even a one‐contract trade.
This strategy was tested on the Donchian trend‐following strategy across
the 56‐commodity database (1980–2011). A starting account equity of
$1,000,000 was used. Table 14.1 highlights performance metrics for various
fixed‐risk percentages.

Table 14.1 highlights a number of points regarding the fixed‐risk sizing
strategy:
Excellent returns can be achieved with a small fixed‐risk percentage.
■
As fixed‐risk percentage increases, so do the annual return and draw‐
■
down. Though not shown, this trend continues until a fixed‐risk per-
centage is reached that causes a draw‐down to exceed account equity so
trading stops.
The ratio of return to risk is continually increasing, though at a decreas-
■
ing rate, as the gain‐to‐pain ratio shows. This means that the more risk a
trader can take, the greater the relative reward.
The recommended way to trade this approach is to mentally determine
the largest percentage draw‐down you could trade through and select a
fixed‐risk percentage that yields a max draw‐down number less than that
amount. If the return is satisfactory for that draw‐down, trading can com-
mence with the strategy. Many will overestimate the draw‐down they can
sustain because of the lure of potentially larger returns. They will rational-
ize the ease of sustaining a 39 percent draw‐down to achieve a 208 percent
return, but when the draw‐down occurs in real trading, reality may set in.
Only a small percentage of traders can watch an account diminish by 40
or 50 percent and remain with the approach, even if that was the expected
eventuality going into trading.
■ Portfolio Selection
As we saw during development of the small‐account portfolios in Chapter 12,
not all the commodities are worth trading. There are three losing commodi-
ties: live cattle, lean hogs, and cocoa. Those will be left out of the large‐
account portfolio. Table 14.2 shows the commodities that will form the
basis for development.

The draw‐downs are still too large for the strategy to be tradeable.
Our portfolio contains some groups with a lot of commodities: The fi-
nancial group has 11, the metals have 9, and the currencies have 8. Let’s
limit group exposure and see if the draw‐downs can be reduced.
■ First-N-in-a-Group
In this money management approach, group exposure is limited to N com-
modities. If a group, like the grains, is in N commodity trades and a new
grain trade is signaled, that trade is bypassed. Table 14.4 shows performance
when group exposure is capped at N commodities and 1 percent of equity
is risked per trade.
The gain‐to‐pain ratio shows there’s a modest performance enhancement
when group exposure is limited to a max of seven. There is also a small drop

■ Limit Trade Risk on Entry
This technique is the same as we explored in Chapter 12. When a trade is
originated, the trade risk is the distance, converted to dollars, from the
entry point to the catastrophic stop loss point. Because our three standard
deviation stop is volatility‐based, some trades will have a relatively small
risk, and some a relatively large risk. Using this money management strat-
egy, trades with a high trade risk are bypassed. Table 14.5 shows results for
a range of entry‐risk thresholds.

You might be surprised that this tactic didn’t improve our trading solu-
tion: The $2,000 trade risk limit worked very well in our small‐ account
development. The reason is the normalization that takes place with our

sizing approach. If, for a given equity level, our large‐account sizing ap-
proach were to take a 10‐lot of a trade with a $2,000 entry trade risk,
it would take a 5‐lot of a trade with a $4,000 entry trade risk. The total
risk for the position is the same. In the small account where we’re trading
one‐lots of everything, the $4,000 position has twice the risk of the $2,000
position. This normalization in large‐account trading makes no one trade
riskier than any other; hence they all should be used. Let’s look at the next
large‐account money management tactic.
■ Limit the Total Number of Open Trades
Again, this is the same strategy used for the small‐account money manage-
ment analysis in Chapter 12. If the number of ongoing open trades reaches
a limit, signaled trades are bypassed. Table 14.6 shows the pertinent trade
statistics when the number of open trades is capped.

*Baseline
**New baseline
The results show that this money management technique only marginally
improves results. Limiting open trades to a max of 30 will be added as the
new baseline. That this tactic did not significantly improve results is more
surprising than the fact that eliminating risky trades did not improve perfor-
mance. There definitely is an ebb and flow in the number of open trades—
sometimes many, sometimes few. It would seem to make sense that both
risk and reward increase when there are a relatively high number of trades,
so limiting trades should reduce the draw‐downs, but for this strategy it
barely makes a difference. It’s my experience that this money management
tactic works best with longer‐term trend‐following strategies; those that
hold trades longer and consequentially have a higher profit‐per‐trade as well
as a larger open‐equity give‐back.

■ Limit the Percentage of Open-Trade Risk
This technique is similar to the small‐account money management strat-
egy of limiting the open‐trade dollar risk of a trade to a max amount.
The difference is that instead of a fixed dollar cap, a percentage value is
formed by dividing the dollar value of the open‐trade risk by total account
equity. Open trades that exceed a percentage value limit of equity are
exited. Note that this is a form of profit‐taking; trades that reach the limit
are deeply in profit, and the exit is done at the peak profit of the trade to
that point. Table 14.7 shows results when this technique is added to the
baseline.

This technique does not improve the trading solution and will not be

■ Limit the Percentage of Total Portfolio
Open-Trade Risk
This technique is similar to the small‐account money management strategy
of limiting the total portfolio open‐trade dollar risk to a max amount. The
difference is that instead of a fixed dollar cap, a percentage value is formed
by dividing the total portfolio dollar value of open‐trade risk by total ac-
count equity. If the limit is exceeded, the trade with the largest open‐trade
risk is exited. Note that this is a form of profit‐taking; the trade that is ex-
ceeded will be deeply in profit, and the exit is done at the peak profit of the
trade to that point. Table 14.8 shows results when this technique is added
to the baseline.

T his technique does not improve the trading solution and will not be
added. The fact that there is a change from the baseline when trades are
exited if the total percentage of open‐trade risk is 50 percent of the port-
folio signifi es that there is a large variation in the percentage of portfolio
open‐trade risk; 50 percent of account equity is a lot, especially when we’re
only risking 1 percent of equity at trade origination. It would seem that
curtailing trades when portfolio risk is at the large extremes would be the
prudent thing to do, but Table 1 4.8 clearly shows otherwise (with this strat-
egy). In my experience this money management technique is eff ective with
strategies that have a relatively large open‐trade equity give‐back.

Note a few observations concerning the yearly numbers:
Risk is obviously increasing over time. For the first half of the run (1980
■
through 1995), only one year had a max draw‐down of 20 percent or
greater. Over the second half, six years did. Also, the average max draw‐
down for the first half of the run was 15.1 percent per year, while it was
17.4 percent per year over the last 16 years of the run.

230
SEITIDOMMOC

SEUQNIHCET
Profitability is decreasing. Over the first 16 years, the average prof-
■
it‐per‐year was 112.2 percent. It was 62.9 percent over the second
16‐year period. Also, the last year shown had the worst profit in the
whole 32‐year period (not even 1 percent).
These tendencies indicate there was been a shift in the way commodities
■
trade. I attribute it to increased volatility, but I don’t think it’s a one‐
time step change. I believe that starting around the time of the dot‐com
bubble, more and more money found its way into the commodity asset
class and that money was not traded/invested in the same way as it had
in the past: by money managers trying to make money on the long side as
prices went up, and on the short side as prices went down. An increasing
percentage of it is being traded/invested by managers collecting a sector,
whether it be energies, metals, financials, and so forth. That makes price
movement choppier as the two methodologies collide.
We are almost to the point where there is enough historical data to
■
generate thousands of trades over commodity data from the mid‐ to
late‐1990s on. Developing a minimally curve‐fit solution over that
data set would yield an entirely different solution set than what we
have in this book, and probably better than what we have here over
that time frame.
One of the advantages of large‐account trading is that you’re not stuck
with a one‐point trading solution like you are with the small accounts. You
can tailor the resultant solution to your risk‐taking preference by varying
the amount you risk per trade while leaving the rest of the money manage-
ment rules as is. Table 14.10 shows results when the percentage of equity
risked per trade is varied from small to rather large.
TABLE 14.10 Performance versus Percent of Equity Risked per Trade
Percent of Equity Average Annual Average Annual Max
Risked per Trade Return (%) Draw‐Down (%) Max Draw‐Down (%) Gain‐to‐Pain Ratio

Again, the greater the pain a trader can take in the form of draw‐down,
the greater the relative reward, as the increasing gain‐to‐pain ratio shows.

■ Conclusion
This chapter has shown that if we risk 0.5 percent of equity per trade, limit
group exposure to a max of seven trades at a time, and limit the number of
total trades to 30 or fewer, we have a very tradeable solution for large ac-
counts: an average annual return of over 39 percent, a max draw‐down in
the last 32 years of 21.7 percent, and an expected max draw‐down of under
10 percent each year. But the beauty of large‐account trading is that you’re
not stuck with a one‐point trading solution like you are with the small ac-
counts. You can tailor the resultant solution to your risk‐taking preference
by varying the amount you risk per trade while leaving the rest of the money
management rules as is.
One last note about the large‐account money management techniques:
You may have noticed that the performance gains, aside from the fixed‐risk
sizing, were at best marginal; the difference in the gain‐to‐pain ratio only
increased from 5.17 to 5.37. The fixed‐risk sizing did contribute a jump in
performance over the gain‐to‐pain ratio we achieved in Chapter 12 with
our full‐size portfolio, a value of 2.98. The reason for the small increase
after the fixed‐risk sizing was due to the way the commodity strategy was
developed: Each rule and parameter value maximized the reward‐to‐risk
ratio. There simply wasn’t much left for the money management to do on
the risk side once each trade was put on at a size that equalized trade risk
across the portfolio.
In the next chapter, we’ll develop a large‐account money management
solution for the stock strategy.

hapter 14 introduced the large account tactics a trader can use to tailor
a system to a desired set of performance metrics. In this chapter we’ll
apply some of those tactics to the stock strategy we developed in Chapters 4
through 6. As noted in the small account money management chapter for
stocks (Chapter 13), groups are not applicable to the NASDAQ stocks.
■ Fixed-Rate Sizing
This is the identical money management approach we used last chapter with
the commodity system: A fixed percentage of equity is risked on each trade.
It is implemented by multiplying the fixed percentage by account equity on
the day of the trade to determine the dollar amount to be risked. Then, the
strategy’s trade risk is used to determine the number of shares that should
be traded to risk the desired amount. For the stock system, we do not have a
(cid:30)(cid:22)(cid:6)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:28)(cid:3)(cid:12)(cid:6)(cid:4)(cid:43)(cid:12)(cid:3)(cid:9)(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:4)(cid:13)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:26)(cid:19)(cid:16)(cid:5)(cid:3)(cid:40)(cid:16)(cid:20)(cid:9)(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:4)(cid:13)(cid:4)(cid:43)(cid:12)(cid:3)(cid:9)(cid:26)(cid:5)(cid:2)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:3)(cid:8)(cid:6)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:9)(cid:1)(cid:11)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:9)(cid:44)(cid:3)(cid:2)(cid:23)(cid:14)(cid:2)(cid:40)(cid:9)(cid:4)(cid:16)

catastrophic stop, so the trade risk will have to be another measure of vola-
tility. In Chapter 13, we used the three standard deviations of closing price,
converted to dollars by multiplying the point value by the number of shares
bought with the $5,000 position. Let’s use that again.
This tactic was tested on the Donchian counter‐trend‐following strategy
across the NASDAQ 100‐stock basket (2000–2011). Starting account eq-
uity of $1,000,000 was used. Table 15.1 highlights performance metrics for
various fixed‐risk percentages.
TABLE 15.1 Fixed‐Risk Performance on the Stock Strategy

*Baseline
Table 15.1 shows that the average annual return is greater than the max
draw‐down and more than twice as large as the average max draw‐down in
all cases; we are assured of a tradeable solution. For the rest of the develop-
ment we’ll use 1 percent as the amount risked per trade. Let’s look to limit
the number of trades that are open at a time.
■ Limit the Total Number of Open Trades
This is the same strategy used with the large‐account money management
commodity system. If the number of ongoing open trades reaches a thresh-
old, new signaled trades are passed. Table 15.2 shows the pertinent start‐
trade statistics when the number of open trades is capped.
TABLE 15.2 Limit the Total Number of Open Trades
Max Number of Open Average Annual Average Annual Max Max Draw‐ Gain‐to‐Pain

235
STOCKS
The results show that limiting the number of trades to 45 is the best trad-
ing solution, as measured by the gain‐to‐pain ratio. That condition will be
added to the baseline to form the new baseline.
■ Position Hedging
As we saw in the development of small‐account money management
rules for our stock system, hedging one or more long positions with
short positions in a market surrogate like the SPY ETF can help per-
formance. Table 15.3 shows the baseline with a number of short hedges
added.

45/4 43.1 16.7 27.8 2.58
* Baseline
** New baseline
The results show that this money management technique brings down
both average max draw‐down and max draw‐down significantly from the
baseline. We’ll add two SPY hedges to the existing money management
overlay to form the new baseline.
■ Limit Trade Risk on Entry
This technique is the same as we explored in the small account money man-
agement chapter for commodities (Chapter 12). When a trade is originated,
the trade risk is the distance, converted to dollars, from the entry point to
the catastrophic stop-loss point. Because our three-standard-deviation stop
is volatility‐based, some trades will have a relatively small risk, and some a
relatively large risk. Using this money management strategy, trades with a

236
SKCOTS
high trade risk are bypassed. Table 15.4 shows results for a range of entry‐
risk limits.
TABLE 15.4 Limit Trade Risk on Entry

600 28.2 12.3 25.9 2.30
*Baseline
No improvement is seen with this money management technique so the
baseline will remain unchanged.
■ Other Large-Account Money Management
Techniques
In the large account money management development chapter for the com-
modity system (Chapter 14), we looked at two other large‐account mon-
ey management techniques: limit open‐trade risk and limit total portfolio
open‐trade risk. Those techniques will not help our stock strategy. We have a
$300 scalping profit‐target in place, and both of those techniques are a form
of profit‐taking.
■ Tradeable Solutions for the Stock System
The final large‐account money management overlay for our stock system is:
Limit the number of trades to 45 or less.
■
Hedge with two short SPY position.
■
We saw that when trading this overlay at 1 percent fixed per position, the
strategy averaged 44.6 percent per year, had a 15.0 percent average max
draw‐down, and a max draw‐down in the last 12 years of 27.2 percent.

237
STOCKS
Table 15.5 shows performance using the same money management overlay,
but varying the amount risked per trade.
TABLE 15.5 Large‐Account Stock Performance at Various Risk Levels
Amount Risked per Average Annual Average Annual Max Max Draw‐ Gain‐to‐Pain
Trade(%) Return (%) Draw‐Down (%) Down (%) Ratio

0.4 14.5 5.9 10.8 2.46
0.2 6.3 2.8 5.1 2.26
You can see that the higher the amount risked, the better the trading solu-
tion in terms of the gain‐to‐pain ratio. But some risk‐averse traders might
opt for the 0.2 percent‐risked‐per‐trade solution. There is no “right” choice,
only what’s right for you.

■ Conclusion
In this chapter we developed a large‐account money management overlay
for the stock strategy developed in Chapters 4 through 6. Taking the first
solution from Table 15.4 that has a max draw‐down around 20 percent, we
see that the gain‐to‐pain ratio is 2.61 when the money management overlay
is traded at 0.6 percent of equity per trade. In Chapter 14, we developed a
large‐account overlay for the commodity strategy. Choosing the first com-
modity solution with a max draw‐down near 20 percent, we see that the
solution traded at 0.5 percent of equity had the following performance:
Average annual return: 39.8 percent
Average annual max draw‐down: 9.1 percent
Max draw‐down: 21.7 percent
Gain‐to‐pain ratio: 4.37
Table 15.7 shows the significant differences among these strategies.

STOCKS
Even though the differences are huge, I contend that these strategies can
be directly compared through their respective gain‐to‐pain ratios. The com-
modity strategy is better than the stock strategy because its gain‐to‐pain
ratio is more than 65 percent higher than the stock strategy.
Does that mean we should discard the stock strategy and only trade the
commodity strategy? The next chapter will show that trading both (if your
account is large enough) provides a better solution than either alone.

may opt to only trade the stock strategy, while commodity traders may only
feel comfortable with the commodity strategy. But there are some traders
who would trade both, if there were a good reason to do so.
In this chapter, we’ll test whether the two can be traded together to yield
a trading solution that is better than either alone. Since the stock strategy
was only traded from the year 2000, we’ll limit commodity trades to the
same time frame.
■ The Mechanics of Trading Two (or More)
Strategies Together
There are a number of ways to trade two strategies together, but the
two that have the least associated bookkeeping are segregated equity and
combined equity. In segregated equity, you split your account equity into
two pieces and trade each strategy independently on its assigned equity.

Physically, this can easily be done with sub‐accounts with your brokerage
firm. A variation on the segregated approach is to periodically combine the
equity in the two accounts and split the money back in the same proportion
as it was originally allocated. In the combined equity approach, all strategies
are traded out of the total funds. We’ll test the simplest approach: trading
on the combined equity.
■ Trading the Stock and Commodity Strategies
on Combined Equity
If the stock and commodity strategies were traded together at their full fixed‐
risk percentages, the leverage used would be much greater than trading either
alone on the same amount of equity. For that reason, the fixed‐risk percent-
ages need to be adjusted down. If we want an apples‐to‐apples comparison
of the combined strategy versus either alone, the fixed‐risk percentages need
to be halved (the same idea as trading the full fixed‐risk percentage on half
the equity). Table 16.1 compares the combined strategy performance with
the performance of each strategy traded alone when the fixed‐risk amount is
halved in the combined system run. Note that the commodity performance
shown is only for January 2000 through the end of 2011.
TABLE 16.1 Apples‐to‐Apples Comparison of Individual Strategy Performance
and Combined Strategy Performance, 2000–2011
Average Annual Average Annual Max
Strategy Return (%) Draw‐Down (%) Max Draw‐Down (%) Gain‐to‐Pain Ratio
Stock 23.5 9.0 16.4 2.61
Commodity 26.6 11.0 21.7 2.42
Both 25.5 6.0 8.6 4.25
The table shows that trading the two strategies together is a better solu-
tion than trading either alone; the gain‐to‐pain ratio rises to over $4 of re-
turn for every $1 of draw‐down. That performance increase is due to a large
reduction in average annual max draw‐down and max draw‐down.
Table 16.1 reflects performance if the stock and commodity strategies
are allocated 50 percent of account equity each. Perhaps a better solution
would be to overweight one strategy. To keep the apples‐to‐apples compari-
son going, let’s have each solution sum to a total of one, just as the half and
half of the previous run does. Table 16.2 shows performance outcomes for
various weightings.

A marginal increase is seen when we overweight the stock side and un-
derweight the commodity side by 10 percent.
Lastly, since the max draw‐downs are relatively small on the combined
strategy runs, we can leverage up from the baseline leverage by scaling with
a multiplier. If, for example, the base fixed‐risk leverage was 0.5 percent per
trade and we scaled up by 10 percent, the new fixed‐risk leverage would be
0.5 multiplied by 1.1, or 0.55 percent. Table 16.3 shows results for a num-
ber of increased leverage factors.

1.5 39.2 8.7 13.7 4.51
Again you’ll note that the more risk you can assume, the greater the rela-
tive reward. Any of these solutions is tradeable.
■ Conclusion
In this chapter we developed a money management overlay to trade the
stock and commodity strategies together. The resultant overlay had perfor-
mance that was much better than either strategy alone. This performance
increase was due to a large reduction in both draw‐down metrics. The best

solution is to trade the commodity strategy at 45 percent of its large‐ac-
count money management allocation, and the stocks at 55 percent of their
large‐account money management allocation. If it is desired to increase the
return, those allocations can be multiplied by a leverage factor to yield the
performance shown in the Table 16.3.
This chapter suggests why system development should be an ongoing
process. Even if you have a very tradeable strategy, finding and adding new
ones can lead to even better trading solutions. The key, of course, is that they
need to be different—not necessarily in the instruments they trade, but dif-
ferent enough that the resultant equity curve is not highly correlated with
the equity curves of your current systems.

■ Standard Deviation

where:
n = the number of samples in the group
x= the i sample in the group

The formula may look imposing, but it is really very simple to compute.
You find the mean of the samples in the group by adding up all the values and
then dividing by the number of samples. Then you sum all the squared values
of the mean minus the sample value and divide that sum by the number of
samples minus one to yield a value called the variance. Lastly, you take the
square root of the variance. You may see this formula with n as the divisor
instead of n – 1. That formula is used on an entire population of samples like
all the heights of all the people in the world. When you’re computing the
standard deviation on a sample of the entire population, like the heights of
all the people in the United States, you use the n – 1 value. For large sample
size, it makes little difference.
In this book, the samples are usually closing prices over some period. A
20‐day standard deviation of closing price would be found using the closes
of the last 20 days as the group sample in the formula. But standard de-
viation can be used on other samples, such as range (daily high minus the
daily low). When the top‐to‐bottom range of samples is small, the standard
deviation will be small, and when it is large, the standard deviation will be
relatively large. Thus for a tradeable that goes through benign periods and
trending periods, the standard deviation of the closes, or the range, will
expand or contract with the volatility.
The significance of the standard deviation, or one‐sigma value, is that
for a normally distributed group (looks like a bell‐shaped curve) the range
of values one standard deviation below the mean to one standard devia-
tion above the mean constitute approximately 68 percent of the values in a
sample group. The two‐sigma range (the one‐sigma value multiplied by two)
above and below the mean includes approximately 95 percent of the val-
ues, while the three‐sigma range includes about 99.7 percent of the sample
values. A distribution does not have to be normally distributed to use the
standard deviation formula. It still yields a measure of dispersion from the
mean for other distributions.
■ Volatility Measures and Comparison
Besides standard deviation, average range and average true range are other
commonly used measures of volatility in trading systems. The difference be-
tween average range and average true range is that average true range adds
the distance between yesterday’s bar and today’s bar if today’s bar is a gap
bar. Average range just includes the distance from the high to the low for

247
UNDERSTANDING
THE
FORMULAS
each bar used to compute the average. I’ve found very little diff erence in
using average true range or average range, so I pretty much just use one:
average range. There is a big diff erence between using range and standard
deviation as volatility measures.
The primary diff erence is that standard deviation accounts for directional
volatility, while average range doesn’t. The two data streams in fi gure A.1
will yield the same average range number over the 18 bars shown because
the distance from the high to the low each day is the same in both streams.
But the standard deviation calculation will have a much higher standard devi-
ation number for the fi rst stream because the closes are trending. In this case
standard deviation captures the real volatility better than average range. The
bottom line is that I always check both measures when I use a volatility fi lter.
Data Stream 1
Data Stream 2
FIGURE A.1 Non‐Directional and Directional Data Streams
■ Correlation
Correlation is the degree to which two data streams move in the same direc-
tion. There is a mathematical formula called the Pearson correlation coef-
fi cient that measures correlation values, referred to as r, in the range ‐1 to 1.
If two data streams yield a value of 1, they are perfectly correlated and rise
and fall together, although not necessarily at the same rate. When the output
is −1, they are perfectly negatively correlated and when one rises the other
falls—again, not necessarily at the same rate. For values close to 0, the two

248
SALUMROF
EHT
GNIDNATSREDNU
data streams are non‐correlated and the data streams move independently
of each other. Figure A.2 shows pairs of data streams and their associated
correlation coeffi cients.
r = 1 r = −1 r = 0
FIGURE A.2 Correlation Coeffi cients for Various Data Pairs
The formula to compute the Pearson correlation coeffi cient is:
∑ ∑ ∑
n x y − x y
r= i i i i
( ∑ (∑ ) ( ∑ (∑ )))
n x2− (x )2 . n y2− (y )2
i i i i
where:
n = the number of samples in the group
x = the i sample in data stream 1
i th
y = the i sample in data stream 2
i th
r = the Pearson correlation coeffi cient
This is another formula that looks complex, but it can be calculated in
a single pass of the two data streams (stream x and stream y). If the two
streams are paired, as you go down the two columns you make three calcu-
lations: the sum of the product of the two data points, ∑x y ; the sum of the
i i
x points, ∑x ; and the sum of the y points, ∑y . Then just insert in the formula
i i
and solve for r.
There are many uses for correlation. In Appendix B, it will be used to
show the degree of correlation between commodities in the same group. It
can also be used to show the degree of serial correlation in a data stream.
Serial correlation is the degree to which previous data in the stream infl u-
ences the value of succeeding data. If a stream has a high degree of serial cor-
relation, up‐moves in the stream will be followed by other up‐moves, and

249
UNDERSTANDING
THE
FORMULAS
down‐moves followed by down‐moves. Serial correlation can be exploited
for gain. Suppose the profit for each trade is put in a file sequentially and
correlated with the same file lagged by one place. If the correlation of the
two streams is positive, it means winning trades have a tendency to follow
a period of winning trades, and losing trades follow losers. In real trading,
when you have a good winning streak you might up the size of your trades to
take advantage of expected additional winners, and when in a losing streak,
reduce size or even cut off trading.
In trading, perhaps the best use of correlation is to illustrate the power of
diversification in money management. If the difference in consecutive clos-
ing prices of two trading variables is normally distributed, a third variable
formed by summing the first two will have the following standard deviation:
σ 2 = σ 2 + 2 r σ σ + σ 2
3 1 12 1 2 2
where:
σ is the standard deviation of the change in closes of the first variable
1
σ is the standard deviation of the change in closes of the second
2
variable
σ is the standard deviation of the change in closes of the new variable
3
r is the correlation coefficient between the two variables
12
Think of the first two variables as trades in your portfolio that move in
price from day to day (hopefully in the direction of your trade). The third
variable is the portfolio value. The standard deviation of portfolio value rep-
resents the movement of the portfolio, either up or down. It is instructive
to assign some values to the variables and look at outcomes, as Table A.1
illustrates.
TABLE A.1 Portfolio Outcomes Based on Two Variables
Variable 1 Standard Variable 2 Standard Variable 3 Standard
Deviation (Points) Deviation (Points) Correlation between 1 and 2 Deviation (Points)
5 5 1 10
5 5 0 7.1
5 5 –1 0
The first row in the table has Variable 1 and Variable 2 perfectly corre-
lated. When the close of Variable 1 is up, so is that of Variable 2. When the
close of Variable 1 is down, so is that of Variable 2. They are moving in per-
fect lock‐step. Since the standard deviation of both Variable 1 and Variable 2

250
SALUMROF
EHT
GNIDNATSREDNU
is the same (a value of 5), the portfolio moves as if you’re trading two con-
tracts of the same tradeable (10 points).
The second row highlights the rationale behind the diversification used
in traditional money management. With no correlation between Variable 1
and Variable 2, the portfolio moves less than the sum of the two variables’
standard deviations, but more either variable alone. Some people make the
argument that if your portfolio is fully diversified with uncorrelated assets,
your risk actually goes down. This two‐variable portfolio shows that the risk
doesn’t go down. With each additional uncorrelated variable portfolio risk
does go up, but at a decreasing rate.
The last row shows trading nirvana. If you could successfully trade two
instruments at the same time that are perfectly negatively correlated, you
would have no risk. There are commodities that are negatively correlated
to a high degree like the Dollar Index and the Japanese yen, but finding a
strategy that makes money on both while long at the same time, or short at
the same time is the problem.
The two‐variable formula above can be easily extended to any number of
tradeables, trading any number of contracts/shares of either long or short
positions.

ommodity trading is a zero-sum game. For each contract traded, there
will be a buyer and a seller. For traders, not hedgers, the buyer believes
the price of the commodity is going up, while the seller believes the price
is going down. Price movement up from the entry price of the trade will
cause the buyer to have a profitable position (positive open‐trade equity, or
run‐up), while the seller will be in the red by the exact same amount the
buyer is ahead (negative open‐trade equity, or draw‐down). When either the
buyer or seller closes out a position, that trade is ended with either a profit
or loss (closed‐trade profit or loss).
Commodities are traded by a number of exchanges in the United States
and abroad. The exchange is really a sponsor of the commodity being traded
and administers trading to include the size of the contract, the hours it is
traded, the delivery months traded, minimum movement of price, and
margin requirements.

■ The Contract
The basis of trading is the commodity contract. It has a specific start date
and an expiration date. The contract is an obligation to either buy or provide
the underlying commodity at the price the trade is entered at upon contract
expiration. The seller commits to provide the underlying deliverable. Most
trades are ended before contract expiration, so a trader can exit his position
before first notice day, and neither provide nor take delivery of the contract.
There are commodity contracts for a variety of raw materials and foodstuffs
like copper or corn. The vast majority of these are settled in the physical
deliverable. A seller of a copper contract would have to deliver 25,000
pounds of high‐grade copper upon contract expiration, while a buyer of
corn would receive 5,000 bushels of corn.
Each contract has a specific size and a specific trading start date and
contract expiration date. As a trader, you will probably want to trade the
most liquid month. Generally the most liquid month has the highest reported
volume and open interest. It is called the front month because most specu-
lative traders are making their trades on that contract. Volume is the total
number of contracts traded on a given day. It is reported in two ways: by
contract, or across all contracts. Open interest is the total number of paired
contract positions. If the open interest is reported at 10,000 contracts, it
means that there are 10,000 long positions and 10,000 short positions.
■ Contract Pricing
As a trader, it is crucial to understand the potential risk and reward of any
position you enter. Risk and reward depend on the type of contract you are
trading (oats versus the S&P, for example), the relative recent volatility of
the commodity, and the way it is priced by the exchange. The size of a corn
contract is 5,000 bushels. If the price of a bushel goes up a penny, the value
of the corn contract has just increased by $50 ($0.01 × 5,000). If the price
of a copper contract goes down by a penny, the value of the copper contract
has decreased by $250 ($0.01 × 25,000) where 25,000 is the number of
pounds of high‐grade copper in one contract.
■ Relative Contract Risk
The corn and copper examples illustrate that a one‐cent move in copper nets
five times as large a change in contract value as a one‐cent move in corn.

253
UNDERSTANDING
FUTURES
Is trading copper five times as risky as trading corn? The answer depends
on the volatility of the underlying commodity. If corn’s price movement is
five times as volatile as copper, their contract risks are approximately equal.
Volatility can be measured in any number of ways, but I prefer to use the
standard deviation of the closing prices. (See Appendix A for information
regarding standard deviation.) The standard deviation is just the dispersion
of price from its average price over some time frame. The formula for stan-
dard deviation is:
∑n
(μ−x )2
σ= i=1 i
n−1
where:
n = the number of samples in the group
x = the i sample in the group
i th
μ = the mean of a group that has n samples
σ = the standard deviation of the samples in the group
To determine the relative risk of each contract, the average 40‐day
standard deviation of the closes over the trading life of the contract was
computed. For analysis purposes, continuous contracts were used. Table B.1
shows the underlying commodity; its mean standard deviation over its life;
its max and min standard deviation over its lifetime; and the dollar value of
the average standard deviation.

Table B.1 clearly shows that there is a big difference between contracts.
The average 40‐day standard deviation results in a variance of $8,800 for
a full‐size Nasdaq 100 contract, but only $323 for oats. It is clearly much
riskier to trade a Nasdaq 100 contract than an oat contract. Moreover, the
max and min variance within a given commodity shows that at different
times there is a big difference within the same commodity. The Nasdaq 100
has an average volatility of $8,800, but it has been as low as $1,140 and as
high as $46,500, a very large range. This is the reason I advocate using stops
relative to recent volatility.
■ Commodity Groups
It is convenient to group commodities into categories. The most commonly
used grouping refers to the grains (or agriculturals), meats, metals, ener-
gies, currencies, financials, softs, and stock indices. The following breakout
is my grouping of the commodities that I develop trading systems across:
Grains Meats Softs

The reason to group commodities is that, generally, those in the same
group are highly correlated with each other. For money management rea-
sons it is much more advantageous to trade a basket of commodities that
are lowly correlated to each other than a basket that is high correlated, even
if each basket makes the same amount of money over time. The reason to
avoid correlated commodities is that they tend to move together. A good
trade in one will be a good trade across all, and a bad trade in one will gener-
ally be a bad trade for all the other commodities highly correlated to it. It is
the bad trades to watch out for. A number of trades losing at the same time
will cause a big pullback in your trading equity (draw‐down). On the other
hand, it is much more likely that an uncorrelated basket will not frequently
have bad trades together. They tend to move on their own individual funda-
mentals independently of each other.
When a correlation algorithm is used on two data sets, the correlation
number that is returned will range from –1 to +1. A –1 value means the two
data sets move in the opposite direction at each data point. A value of +1
means the two data sets move in the same direction at each data point. I use
a value of 0.40 as a significant positive correlation between two data streams.
Tables B.2 through B.9 show the correlation among all the commodities
in each group. They were generated using the Pearson correlation algorithm.

To use Table B.2, enter the first commodity you are interested in from
the left of the table and move across the row until you hit the column that
intersects with the second commodity you are interested in. For example,
corn is correlated at a level of 1 with itself and 0.5 with oats. Looking over
all the relationships, it is clear that all the members of the grain group are
significantly correlated with one or more of the other commodities, with

257

the exception of rough rice, which isn’t significantly correlated with any
other grain group member.

The cattle members (live cattle and feeder cattle) are significantly cor-
related with one another. The cattle members and hogs are correlated at the
0.25 to 0.35 range with each other—not significant correlation, but on the
threshold.

None of the members of the softs group show a significant correlation
with any other member. I treat them as totally independent of each other. I
should note that the softs group is really a “cats and dogs” group. Things that
don’t readily fit in another group are lumped here. Clearly the fundamentals
driving each of these commodities are very different, as are the areas that
primarily produce them.
As shown in Table B.5, the precious or semi‐precious metal members of
this group (silver, gold, and platinum) are all highly correlated with each
other. Palladium, which is an industrial white metal used primarily in cat-
alytic converter production, is more highly correlated with the precious
metal group than the industrial metal members (copper and the London
metals). All the industrial metals are highly correlated with each other.

As shown in Table B.6, all the members of the energy group are signifi-
cantly correlated with one or more of the other commodities of the group.

All the major currencies (euro, yen, franc, pound, and dollar) are all
highly correlated with each other. The yen, franc, and pound tend to move
up and down together, while the dollar moves in the opposite direction
of those three (high negative correlation). Note that the dollar and euro
have an almost perfect negative correlation, −0.97. The minor currencies
(Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, and Mexican peso) are not highly cor-
related with the major currencies, nor are they highly correlated with each
other. It is my experience that these three currencies are much harder to
trade than the majors.
Table B.8 illustrates that all U.S. financials are highly correlated with each
other, and the degree of correlation is highest with instruments closest in
maturity length (30‐year bond and 10‐year note, 10‐year note and 5‐year
note, etc.). All U.S. financials are also highly correlated with the foreign
financials, but the degree of correlation is less than within the U.S. financial
group. Likewise, all foreign financials are highly correlated with each other,
and the highest correlation occurs within instruments from the same region
(Spanish bond, Euro bund, and Long gilt, which are all European instru-
ments).
The U.S. stock indices are highly correlated to all members of that group,
and significantly correlated with the Nikkei (Table B.9).

■ Margin
A major difference between commodity trading and equity trading is the le-
verage involved. When executing a commodity trade, you do not have to pay
the full value of the contract. You only have to have sufficient funds in your
account to meet the exchange’s current margin requirements for the con-
tract. If for example, corn is currently trading at $3 a bushel, the value of the
contract is $15,000. The exchange may have a current margin requirement
of $500 to control the contract. With an account equity of $1,000 you could
buy or sell two contracts under those margin requirements. In that case you
would be fully margined, a dangerous position to be in. If the price moved
against your position by even a penny, you would face a margin call. In that
case you would have to either liquidate some or all of your position, or add
funds to meet the margin call.
To illustrate the leverage involved, suppose you went long two contracts
with the $1,000 in your account and the price of corn moved up $0.10 from
$3.00 to $3.10. That’s only a 3.33 percent increase in price, but it is an open
equity profit of $500 per contract. On the two contracts, you would be
ahead $1,000, or 100 percent on your account equity. In equity trading, you
can usually only margin at a max of twice the amount in your account. With
the same $2,000 in your equity account, you would be fully margined if
you bought 200 shares of a stock trading at $10 per share. If the price of the
equity went up 3.33 percent, it would now be trading at $10.33 per share.
Your 200 shares would be worth $2,066.66 and you would be ahead $66.66
on your $1,000 equity, or 6.67 percent. The leverage of the fully margined
corn trade is about 15 times larger than the fully leveraged stock trade.
It is dangerous to trade commodities fully leveraged. If price moves rap-
idly against your positions, you can lose more than you have in your account.
In the case of the fully leveraged corn trade, a move of $0.15 against your po-
sition (a relatively small move in corn) would cause an open equity decrease

263
UNDERSTANDING
FUTURES
of $750 per contract in your account. Holding two contracts, your original
$1,000 account would now be debit $500.
Most experienced commodity traders don’t even consider margin re-
quirements when trading. Their money management considers risk from a
draw‐down probability standpoint, and they leverage to experience draw‐
downs within their personal risk tolerance, not to margin requirements.
Most traders have a tough time trading through 20 percent draw‐downs so
they build a trading plan that keeps them inside their comfort zone. Mar-
gin requirements are no help because they are a lagging indicator of risk.
The exchanges react after the fact to price moves or volatility with margin
requirement changes. If a commodity experiences increased volatility, they
will move margin requirements higher, but as a trader it’s too late: You’ve
already experienced the increased volatility at the reduced margin levels.
■ Electronic Contracts
Futures were traded in pits from the start of domestic commodity trading
until the last decade. The plot of the movie Trading Places revolves around
orange juice futures, and the pit is prominently shown. As technology ad-
vanced electronic trading started, most notably in the S&P futures. Now
almost all trading is done electronically.
A typical electronically traded contract operates much of the weekday
with short down periods. For example, the yen traded on the Chicago Mer-
cantile Exchange (CME) trades electronically from 5 PM EST to 4 PM EST.
That contract still has a pit which trades from 8:20 AM EST to 3 PM EST.
The trader should be careful when trading electronic contracts during
the night and early morning. Volume drops off dramatically from the peak
daytime hours. A practice I use for market orders based on the close is to
enter the order when the pit session opens, if the commodity still has a pit,
or when the old daytime pit session opened. In the case of the yen, I’d place
a market order at 8:20 AM EST.

APPENDIX C
Understanding
Continuous
Contracts
265
I
f you’re conducting an analysis using stock or commodity data, you need to
account for real‐trading data disruptions. In commodities, that means the
trading transactions that occur when the front-month contract you’re trading
nears its last day of trading, and you exit that contract and enter a position
in the new lead contract. For stocks, it means the change that happens to the
data stream due to splits and dividends. This appendix shows how continuous
contracts can be constructed and used so that hypothetical testing on the con-
tract provide the same results as real‐time trading across these disruptions.
■ Properly Accounting for Stock Splits
and Dividends
Most stock data vendors offer a choice of data formats that includes the
actual historical stock prices for each day (raw data), a price stream that is

adjusted for stock splits (split‐adjusted), and a price stream that is adjusted
for the dividends the company has paid over time (dividend‐adjusted). All
the information in these historical price streams is required to correctly de-
termine the change in any given equity over a period of time. Unfortunately,
each of these price streams alone will yield incorrect results if a dividend or
stock split has occurred after the date of the calculations.
Problems with the Actual‐Price File
To illustrate, we’ll use the IBM price stream as an example. On May 5, 1999,
IBM had a two‐for‐one stock split. On the close of trading for that day the
price of IBM was $236.25. IBM issued two shares for every one outstanding
and adjusted the price to $118.125. The dollar value of each shareholder’s
stock remained the same, because each shareholder now owned double the
number of shares at half the pre‐split price. Table C.1 shows the actual‐price
data file for IBM following closes around the time of the split.
TABLE C.1 Actual Prices for IBM around Split Time
Date Close

5/27/1999 116
5/28/1999 116
6/1/1999 112
If you used the actual‐price data file for analysis, and you entered a long
trade on the close of May 24, 1999, and exited the trade on the close of
June 1, 1999, your trade would have lost about 112 points, or 50 percent. In
reality, the two shares of stock after the split would have been worth $224 on
June 1, 1999, and you would have actually made a marginal amount on the
trade. Looking at this example, you might think the only problem with
the actual‐price data stream occurs across splits. There is another problem:
The actual‐price data stream yields incorrect results because it doesn’t
account for dividend payouts.
To illustrate, IBM issued an $0.18 per share dividend on February 7,
2005. Table C.2 shows the actual‐price data file around this time.

2/8/2005 94.13
2/9/2005 92.7
If you used this data stream and entered a long trade on the close of
February 7, 2005, and exited on the close of February 8, 2005, you would
show a loss of $0.40 per share. Due to the $0.18 dividend, you really would
have lost only $0.22 per share.
Using the actual‐price data stream, one can rationalize that if you elimi-
nate bad trades around splits, you will get fairly accurate results because the
effect of the dividends is small. This may be true for some analyses, but for
some studies the effect of dividends is crucial. From 1980 to March 2005,
the total IBM dividend payout was $64.32. During that time IBM appre-
ciated a total of 238.8 points across two stock splits. Ignoring dividends,
IBM grew 383 percent since 1980. When dividends are included, the actual
growth was 473 percent, a significant difference.
Problems with the Split‐Adjusted File
Using the split‐adjusted data stream for analysis causes similar problems.
The breakout in Table C.3 shows the actual‐price closes and the split‐
adjusted closes for a few days surrounding IBM’s last split.
TABLE C.3 Actual and Split‐Adjusted Prices for IBM around Split Time

6/1/1999 112 112
The split‐adjusted data stream is formed by dividing the actual price level
by the split value, in this case by two and before May 26, 1999. One other
stock split has occurred in IBM since 1980, and that was in 1996. On that
two‐for‐one split, the actual‐price values on the split day, and earlier, would

268
STCARTNOC
SUOUNITNOC
GNIDNATSREDNU
be divided by four. The problem with using split‐adjusted data is the fact that
day‐to‐day price changes and daily ranges are divided by the split value. The
actual change in price from May 25, 1999, until the close of the next trading
day is a little more than 15 points, but the split‐adjusted data only reflects
about 7.5 points.
This can cause a number of analysis problems. If you are using any form
of volatility‐ or range‐based system, the values artificially change from split
to split. Furthermore, trades will change. If IBM were to split two‐for‐one
again, the split‐adjusted change from May 26, 1999, until May 27, 1999,
would change from about 7.5 to about 3.75.
The split‐adjusted price stream also shares a problem in common with
the actual‐price data stream: The changes due to dividends are not included.
Problems with the Dividend‐Adjusted File
The dividend‐adjusted file is formed by going back in time and subtracting
the cumulative dividends paid from the actual‐price data. The breakout in
Table C.4 shows the actual‐price closes and the dividend‐adjusted closes across
the latest dividend distribution, the $0.18 dividend on February 7, 2005.
TABLE C.4 Actual and Dividend‐Adjusted Prices for IBM around Dividend Time
Date Actual‐Price Close Dividend‐Adjusted Close
2/4/2005 94.51 94.33

2/8/2005 94.13 94.13
2/9/2005 92.7 92.7
Using the dividend‐adjusted file, the correct daily change of $0.22 is
shown from February 7, 2005, until February 8, 2005. The problem with
using this file is the fact that, as we go back in time, the prices get further
and further away from the actual prices. On January 2, 1980, the dividend‐
adjusted close was –2.828, while the actual IBM price on that date was 62.5.
Stock Data Problem Summary
None of the price streams accurately reflect what really occurred over time.
It’s clear that actual prices must be involved, as well as the split and dividend
information. But there isn’t a price stream available that provides all the
information required.

CONTRACTS
The Solution
There is a simple solution to the problem. The three data streams can be
manipulated to yield a price stream that accurately reflects what happened
across any period of time. Following are the steps used in the algorithm:
1. The actual‐price data and the split‐adjusted data are used to find the
multiplying factor for each day due to splits. Each day the split‐adjusted
close is divided into the actual close to determine the multiplying factor.
Going back in time, the factor will be 1 until the first split. Then it will
change according to the split (2–1, 3–1, 1–3, etc.). At each split the
multiplying factor will change.
2. Use the actual‐price data and the dividend‐adjusted data to determine
the cumulative amount of dividends taken out over time. Each day the
dividend‐adjusted close is subtracted from the actual‐price close to de-
termine the cumulative dividends paid put from that date forward.
3. Construct a back‐adjusted continuous contract by multiplying the
actual‐price data each day by the factor for that day, and subtract the
accumulated dividends for that date.
4. Write out the date, open, high, low, and close of the back‐adjusted con-
tract, and add a final field: the actual closing price that day.
Table C.5 shows the first and last line of the continuous contract for IBM.
TABLE C.5 Continuous Contract Data for Actual Prices for IBM
Date Open High Low Close Actual Close
1/2/1980 –210.0938 –208.5938 –210.5938 –210.5938 62.5
3/14/2005 93.79 94.04 92.5 93.04 93.04
This data stream accurately reflects the appreciation of IBM over the 25‐
year period. The difference between the close on March 14, 2005, and the
close on January 2, 1980 is about 303 points, the sum of the 238‐point price
appreciation across splits, and the $64 in dividends paid out over the years.
Note that this data file contains all the information needed to compute
accurate changes in both points, and in percent. Each daily change is identi-
cal to the actual change that occurred over time so point changes are accu-
rate. When that total is divided by the actual price the accurate percentage
change over the time frame can be determined. Table C.6 shows a few days
of the continuous contract and the actual‐price data. Note how the daily
price changes are the same in both data streams.

8/13/1997 –18.671 104.375 +0.9375
The day‐to‐day price changes of both the continuous contract and the
actual‐price contract are identical, so the continuous contract reflects the
historical change in points accurately. To determine the percentage change
over any period of time, the point change is found using the continuous
price data, and then the percentage change is found by dividing by the actual
price, which is the last entry on each continuous contract data line.
Note that intraday changes can also be accurately determined. Table C.7
shows data from a fictional day on the continuous contract.
TABLE C.7 Fictional Continuous Contract Day of Data
Date Open High Low Close Actual Close
xx/xx/xxxx –10 –5 –12 –8 60
Let’s assume that your strategy entered a long trade at –6 on the continu-
ous contract. The actual‐price entry can be determined using the known
relationship between the continuous contract close and the actual‐price
close. The actual‐price close is 68 points higher than the continuous con-
tract close, so the trade entry at –6 on the continuous contract occurred at
an actual price of $62.
Notice that until the first split or dividend, the actual‐price open, high,
low, and close will be identical to the corresponding continuous contract data.
The Difference the Right Data Makes
To illustrate the difference the data stream makes, we will look at a trading
strategy on IBM using the continuous contract, the actual‐price contract,
the split‐adjusted contract, and the dividend‐adjusted contract. The follow-
ing rules were used for the trading strategy:
Buy at the close if the close is below the 10‐day moving average of the
■
close. Place a profit stop 15 percent above the entry, and a stop loss
15 percent below the entry.

271
UNDERSTANDING
CONTINUOUS
CONTRACTS
Exit the trade if price closes above the 10‐day moving average of price,
■
and the trade has lasted at least 20 trading days.
Exit the trade if the stop loss is exceeded on a closing basis.
■
Exit the trade if the profit stop is exceeded on a closing basis.

Table C.8 shows trading results on the four data streams.
TABLE C.8 Trade Statistics on Continuous, Actual‐Price, Split‐Adjusted, and
Dividend‐Adjusted Data
Contract Winning Trades Losing Trades Points of Profit Percentage Points of Profit
Continuous 120 96 195.1 249.1
Actual‐Price 119 99 –60.7 100.2
Split 120 97 28.6 208.6
Dividend 173 184 –103.2 –906.3
Though the number of winning trades and losing trades for the actual‐
price and split‐adjusted contracts are close to the actuals over the 25‐year
time frame, there is a big disparity in both the total number of points of
profit and the total number of percentage points of profit.
Regarding the dividend‐adjusted results, the winning system actually
looks like a loser. In the case of percentage points, the dividend‐adjusted file
goes back to around zero on January 2, 1980. Small daily changes divided by
the small numbers yield very large percentage winners and losers. The net
effect is a result badly skewed by these trades. The reason the points of profit
are so far off has to do with the stops and profit stops. Taking 15 percent of
a small number leaves an even smaller number. These stops and profit stops
were hit much more often than actually would have happened and the total
result does not reflect the real trading.
The continuous contract not only reflects reality, it yields better results
than the same system on the other price streams. This will almost always be
the case with a successful system because the continuous contract has more
range over the data stream than the other contracts. In essence, there is
more profit to be gotten.
Stock Continuous Contract Summary
If you develop stock strategies on data streams that go back more than a
few years, your results are inaccurate, and they may be very inaccurate. If
you had used a data stream that included properly adjusted prices using the

272
STCARTNOC
SUOUNITNOC
GNIDNATSREDNU
actual price, splits, and dividends, your results would reflect actual trad-
ing and would most likely be better than the hypothetical results generated
by the other price streams. Kind of makes you wonder if you passed on a
holy grail system because the data problem dropped performance into the
marginal zone.
■ Properly Accounting for Commodity
Contract Rollover
It is much easier to account for trading disruptions with commodities. The
only adjustment that has to be made is for rollover from the current contract
to the next one as the current contract nears expiration. The way this is done
is to form an artificial data stream that pieces the contracts together. At the
close on the day that the roll from one contract to the next is accomplished,
the difference between the new contract close and the old contract close is
added to all the previous data points (open, high, low, and close). This back‐
adjustment raises or lowers all the previous data so that the prices don’t
match the historical contract prices, but the correct relationship between
open, high, low, and close is maintained, as is the difference in closing prices
from day to day.
Almost all data providers offer these continuous contracts, and some
provide the ability for the user to select the criteria for rolling from the
current lead contract to the next. The most common criterion is when the
open interest in the next lead exceeds the open interest in the current lead.
Different roll criteria will lead to data streams that differ slightly, but they’re
all valid streams.

ost of the time, curve‐fitting is due to not having enough data in the
development sample. This leads to a small sample of trades, which
doesn’t come close to representing the infinite sample. But there are times
when curve‐fitting sneaks unnoticed into your work. This appendix will
highlight some cases. The point of these examples is that curve‐fitting is
costly. If you don’t realize your strategy is curve‐fit, you can lose many thou-
sands of dollars trading it before you either figure out what the problem was
or quit the trading, never knowing why your holy grail failed.
■ Case 1: Stock Pairs Trading
I wanted to see if I could develop a stock strategy that traded a pair of corre-
lated stocks. When the normally correlated pair started to diverge in price,
I’d sell the one going up and buy the one going down, and then wait until
they got in sync again and exit with a profit. The advantages of a strategy like
this are that the risk should be relatively small, and you’re evenly exposed

on both the long and short side, so market ups and downs would have a
minimal impact.
I took my liquid basket of stocks and correlated each one with every
other one, and those that averaged a correlation coefficient of greater than
0.4 over the lifetime of the pair went into my development basket. With a
liquid basket of about 1,300 liquid stocks, I found about 300 pairs for my
development basket.
I then developed a strategy around the 300 pairs and things looked good.
But when I went to trade the developed strategy, results were disappointing.
I didn’t know if it was market conditions or just a bad time for the strategy. It
turns out I had introduced a major degree of curve‐fitting into the process.
When I did the correlations, I used all the data to determine if the stocks
were correlated. That was wrong. Many of the stocks met the correlation
conditions up to a certain point, then stopped, or stopped for a while and
then met the conditions again. I should have used every pair that met the
average correlation number of 0.4 during the time it was correlated. Those
pairs that met the correlation condition at some time during their lifetime,
but not at the end of the entire period of the data sample, would have de-
graded the trading strategy, because at the point they lost correlation they
wandered independently and I was trading them as if they’d revert back to
normal. Those trades would have been mostly losers.
When I went back and redeveloped, including every pair that met the
correlation condition during their lifetime, the strategy was no longer
tradeable.
The moral of this story is that when you use information based on data that
hasn’t occurred in time yet, you are introducing a degree of curve‐fitting.
That can be okay if the curve‐fitting is minimal. That’s exactly the case with
the bar‐scoring technique introduced in this book. But if you do that, you
need to do a Build, Rebuild, and Repair (BRAC) test to determine how
much impact the curve‐fitting has on your solution.
■ Case 2: Using Limit Orders on Daily-Bar
Stock Data
I developed a long‐only stock system that entered on limit orders placed
before the market opened. I’d place anywhere from 50 to 200 orders, but I
only wanted to keep 20. I had software that would cancel the other orders
when I hit 20, so the only problem was when more than 20 hit on the open.

275
MORE
CURVE‐FITTING
EXAMPLES
When that happened, I’d manually close the excess by taking those with
the biggest profit or smallest loss in the first few minutes of trading. In my
back‐tests, I’d keep everything that hit the limit on the open, and for the
rest, if any, I’d randomly select the number needed from all those that filled
after the open. The hypothetical performance numbers were astronomical.
When I started to trade, results diverged almost immediately from the
hypotheticals over the traded time frame. I tracked down the following
problems:
My real trading didn’t get all the trades that my hypotheticals said I should
■
get on the open, even when price clearly traded below the limit order
entry price. I got about 8 out of 10, but these trades were historically
better than those that filled later in the day, so missing any hurt overall
performance. Also, I got slippage in real time that I didn’t account for in
the hypotheticals. If the limit order was 100, and the stock opened at 99,
my hypotheticals would give me the 99, but in reality I’d sometimes get
the 99, but mostly I’d get somewhere between 99 and 100.
Randomly picking the trades that filled after the open was too optimistic.
■
I got way more bad ones than good in real time. Those stocks run through
the limit order and keep heading south. The ones that trade through the
limit and recover, you might not get.
Those issues made the strategy only so‐so. This example is typical of limit
order systems; you really never know how much worse than expected it’s
going to be.
■ Case 3: Bar-Scoring Using Profit-per-Trade
As introduced in this book, bar‐scoring allows you to use any user‐defined
criterion you want. I thought I’d check out using the past profitability over
the last n trades as a bar‐scoring criterion. Suppose n was the last 10 trades.
At every bar, I’d look back over the last 10 trades in that stock and assign the
average profitability of those trades to the bar. When I added that criterion
to the four or five I was already using, the average profitability of the top
scoring trades jumped way up. I was suspicious of the results and started
looking for where I could be curve‐fitting. It turns out that if you use every
bar for a trade and your trades last two or more days, some of your last
10 trades are still not closed out. I was keeping the profit each day for the
trades that hadn’t closed out and these numbers were being used in the

276
SELPMAXE
GNITTIF‐EVRUC
EROM
scoring matrices. They skewed the whole matrix to predict what would hap-
pen with that trade. But since the trade was already in, profit or loss infor-
mation was being introduced when it shouldn’t have. I fixed the problem by
only using closed trades, and the profit‐per‐trade criterion turned out to be
only marginal.
■ Conclusion
There are lots of ways to curve‐fit. Most of the time it’s because you don’t
have enough trades in your development sample. A BRAC test will uncover
that problem. Other times curve‐fitting can be very subtle. The bottom line
is that if results get dramatically better when you do something, closely ex-
amine what you just did.
