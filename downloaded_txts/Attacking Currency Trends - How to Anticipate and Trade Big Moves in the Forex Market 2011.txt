will always remember something Bill Kidder said to me 25 years ago,
soon after I met him for the first time. He said, “Your dad was one of
my first mentors. He gave me his time and taught me a lot about the
markets. He is a good man.” These words are very powerful words and
theystuckwithme.

hope it has provided a benefit to your trading. Remember, however, that

Oneofthehighlightsofmyfather’scareerwasworkingatChaseMan-

being the expert during the Drysdale Government Securities crisis that
shocked Wall Street in 1982. The crisis, built on a string of reverse repur-
chase agreements that went wrong, sent repercussions throughout Wall
Street when the boutique firm defaulted on an interest payment totaling
$250 million. The knock-on effect of the crisis resulted in the Federal Re-
serve’sissuingthatnow all-too-familiarstatement, “TheFedstands ready

traders made money by attacking the trends. My father’s career on Wall
Streetgotmeinterestedintrading,andthatbecamewhatIwantedtodo.
MY JOURNEY
Istartedmyjourneyasasummerinternin1981foraninterestratetrading
pioneer named William Kidder (no relation to Kidder Peabody, a promi-
nentWallStreetfirmatthetime).Billwasoneofthefirsttousemispriced
interest rate futures to arbitrage the U.S. Bill and Bond markets. In 1981
he started a software company with a goal to build a menu of programs
used to exploit arbitrage opportunities in the interest rate markets. The
programswouldrunonAppleIIs,oneofthefirstdesktopcomputers.
Bill’s software was all about finding value and defining risk. I learned
throughBillthatallsuccessfultraderslooktofindgoodvalueandtodefine
their risk. By doing so they are able to keep their fear to a minimum and
trademoreprofitably.
To do the computer programming, Bill hired a team of college
students—mainlyfromIvyLeaguegraduateschools—andpromisedalec-
ture a day, an hourly wage, and a folding chair and computer. I did not
qualifyasanIvyLeaguer—beingarisingjunioratClemsonUniversity(not

Theexperienceoftheinternshipandmyfirstjobgavemeafoundation
forthebusinessoftrading,andmoreimportantly,italsotaughtmeabout
findingvalueinthemarketanddefiningrisk.
In 1984, one of my clients at Citibank was looking for an entry-level
traderfortheinterestratearbitragedeskinthebank’sfundingarea.Since
thesoftwaretheyweretousewasthesoftwareIhelpeddevelopandnow
sold, I was the obvious fit for the job. Green as I was to trading, I was
offeredaposition,andmycareerasatraderbegan.
I worked for Citibank New York for six years, initially as a trader’s
assistant in the bank’s funding department and later making markets in
short-termforwardrateagreementsandinterestrateswaps.In1991,Iwas
fortunate to move to London for four more years where I helped start up
Citibank’sshort-terminterestratederivativesdesk.Itwasduringthistime
that I became more interested in technical analysis. I went to seminars,
readbooks.Computerswerebecomingmoremainstream.Asaresult,get-

It was during this time I was introduced to a trading concept called
MarketProfileTM.TheMarketProfiletaughtmetorecognizedifferentmar-
ketpatterns(i.e.,visuals)thathelpedmeunderstand“exact”riskandhow
toanticipatetrends—twoseedsthatmyfatherandBillKidderfirstplanted

cessful trader rather than simply being a trader. It was a foundation for
movingtothenextstep.
THE MARKET PROFILE APPROACH
MarketProfilewasdevelopedbyabondtraderintheChicagofuturespits
named J. Peter Steidlmayer. The concept centered on breaking down the
dayintotimeperiodsthateachlastedahalfhour.Theperiodswerelettered
A,B,C,andsoon.Forexample,theletterAwouldbeassignedtoallprices
that traded in the first half hour. The price need only trade once in the A
half-hourwindowtogetassignedaspotontheprofile.Inthesecondhalf
hour,theletterBwouldbeassignedtoallpricesthattradedinthatperiod.
Pricesthattradedinthethirdhalfhourofthedaywouldgetassignedthe
letterC,andsoon.
A “Market Profile” would develop with the price moving vertically
from high to low. If a price traded in the A and B periods, the two let-
terswouldgosidebyside,Afirst,thenB.Thisway,rowsoflettersgoing

horizontally would start to develop as the day’s profile was built at each
price.
There were four types of days that would develop using the Market
Profile. Each day fell into one of the buckets. By recognizing the type of
day, a trader could discover important clues about value, risk, trade lo-
cation, and even what might happen tomorrow. As a group, they started
to teach me about key aspects of becoming a more successful trader.
The types were normal distribution, nontrend, double distribution, and
trenddays.

The profile, as it was termed, showed the high volume price, or HVP

horizontal line at the end of the lettered distribution indicated that those
prices were part of the value area. The value area was where 70 percent
oftheday’stradestookplace,representingroughlyonestandarddeviation
for those who might be mathematicians (I am not one, by the way). The

TypesofTraders Duringnormaldistributiontradingdays,theaverage
trader would mainly trade around the middle of the Value Area, making
a little, losing a little—basically treading water. A mentor of mine once
called these traders the “Uncle owns the firm” traders. He reasoned that
they could not get fired, by virtue of blood connections. However, blood
onlygoessofar,sotheywouldnotadvanceinrankwithinthefirmeither.
Theendsofthetradedistributionbellcurvewerecalledtheextremes.
There were two types of traders who traded the extremes. The first type
sawthemarketmovinglowerandjustknewitwasgoingevenlower.They
soldthelowsonlytohavethemarketbouncerightbackwheretheywould
then cover at the upper extreme—or highs—for a nice large trading loss.
These traders were termed the “Mother owns the firm” traders, since the
onlywaytheycouldeverkeeptheirjobwasiftheirmotherownedthefirm.
The other traders who traded the extremes were doing the exact op-
posite. They would be buying at the low extreme and selling at the high
extreme.Theyunderstoodgoodtradelocation.Theyunderstoodthetype
of market the day was developing (i.e., range bound), and what a normal
tradedistributionwouldlooklikeattheendoftheday(yes,itdoeshelpto
visualize the normal bell curve developing). They were great traders, and
theyweretermedthe“Ownsthefirm”traders.
There was another set of traders: the ones who traded in the middle
of the day’s range, but were not satisfied enough at the positive extreme
to take their profit. So instead they held the position and became scared
enough to get out at the losing extreme—and book a loss. Needless to
say,thesetraderswerealso“badtraders”andwereahybridbetweenthe
“Uncle”and“Motherownsthefirm”traders.Theylikelygotfiredatsome
point.
Finally, there were those who traded in the middle and were content
to take a quick profit near the profit extremes. They made smallish gains
andwerealittlebetterthan“Uncleownsthefirm”traders.
So overall, there was one group (a small percentage, mind you) that
madethemoneybybuyinglowandsellinghighattheextremes.Therewas
anotherthatcaughtpartoftheday’srangesandmadealiving,butdidnot

6 INTRODUCTION
Although very simplistic, I began to think in terms of what kind of
traderIwasandwhatkindoftraderIwantedtobe.Itwasharshtorealize
thatIwaslikelyan“Uncleownsthefirm”trader.Needlesstosay,Iwanted
tobeaTraderwho“ownsthefirm”(orasclosetoitaspossible),butdid
not fully know how. It is one thing to say you want to be good at some-
thing,andanothertounderstandhowtodoit.IstartedtostudytheMarket
Profilefurtherandsearchforcluesthatittoldmeaboutthemarkets.
TradingCluesfromNormalDistributionDays Itwasthoughtthat
normaldistributiondaystookplace70percentofthetime.Therangesdif-
fered from day to day, but the pictures ended up looking similar. Since
sevenoutoftendayswere“normal,”Ibegantostarttoseeandanticipate
howthedaysmightdevelopmoreclearly.Overtime,Ibegantodevelopan
ideaofwhatanormalrangewasandbegantothinkintermsofbuyingand
sellingneartargetedextremes.
TherewerealsosomerulesIlearnedthatcouldbeusedtoanticipate
where the normal distribution day would peak or trough. For example, I
learnedthatifyoutooktheHightoLowrangeforthefirsthouroftrading
andsubtracted(oradded)thatvaluetoarangeextensiondown(orup),it
wouldprojectthelowprice(highprice)extremefortheday.Knowingthis
taughtmehowtobeaggressiveonbreaksaboveorbelowtheinitialrange,
howtoanticipateamoveinthedirectionofthebreak,andtargetalevelto
takeprofit,oreventoinitiateacountertrendtrade.
Becauseofthingslikerules,Iwasbecomingatraderwithareasonfor
the trade rather than a trader who traded because the price was moving
higher or lower. I also learned that if I had a reason to do a trade, I also
hadareasontogetoutofatradeifthemarketdidnotdowhatIexpected
it to do. I started defining risk. By defining risk I found fear from trading
started to abate. With less fear I was able to stay in positions longer and
to catch intraday trends. The pieces of being a real trader started coming
together.
For example, in Figure I.2, the first hour (i.e., initial range) of trading
during the A and B periods has a 16/32 range. When the initial range is
breached on the downside during the C time period, the range extension
rule says the market should target an extension level equal to the initial
rangeof16/32nds.
By following the rule for trade extensions, a short position at 98-10
would be initiated, with a target take profit level being at 97-27, 16/32nds
lower.Astopforthetradewouldbeifthepriceextendsbackabove98-14
(to 98-15), which was the low of the A period in the chart. With that stop
in place, risk would be 5/32nds. The target gain would be 15/32nds if the
targetwasreached.Arisk/rewardratioof1:3wasprettygood.

The “If . . . Should” Rule Thisprocessoftradingwasthefoundation
for what I now call the “If . . . Should” rule. The “If . . . Should” rule says:
“IfthemarketdoesXYZ,themarketshoulddoABC.Ifitdoesnotdowhat
it is supposed to do (i.e., ABC), then get out.” We will discuss the “If . . .
Should”rulefurtherinChapter4.
The“If...Should”ruleinrelationtothisexamplewouldsaysomething

IT’S A PROCESS
In this book I will look to take progressive steps forward from forming a

so far was just a small piece of some of the things that helped build my
foundation as a trader, and I thank those firms and the people at those
firmswhoallowedmetodevelopthoseskills.
The second basis for the steps outlined in this book has come over
the past 10 years of my career. Over these years, I have been fortunate
to work for a retail currency brokerage company, FXDD, since the day
of its inception. Through those years, the hats I have worn at the various
stages(andoftensimultaneously)haveincorporatedeverythingfromcus-

position.
Most people who are reading this book are likely market takers (it is
written for your benefit, not the market makers’). You decide if you want
to be long or short, where your stop loss is, perhaps where you will tar-
get a profit. You initiate everything, and you also are solely responsible
foryourprofitandloss.Althoughyoumayknowothersinthemarketand

I liken myself to the golf professional at my local public golf course.
Letmeexplain.
I love the game of golf but find the game challenging, to say the
least. Priorities in life (i.e., children, family, work, writing a book) also
keep me from playing with any regularity. Nevertheless, I do want to im-
prove, so from time to time I may take a golf lesson from a trained golf
professional.

and, without giving any instruction, will have me hit the balls. Invariably,
the first few will be straight down the middle, the customary 150 yards.
However, fear soon enters my brain and the pulls and the slices, the fat
shotsandthinshots,starttoreartheiruglyheads.
When all the balls have been hit, I don’t turn to the pro and say,
“What am I doing right?” Instead, I am more likely to turn to him and
say“WhatamIdoingwrong?”

of balls more than me, has had many more hours of instruction, and has

To me, volatility means that the price can trend one way and then

not have a firm foundation for the risk. It is not good enough to buy and
hold, because the reversals in trends can be storms that cause total fail-

mainly comes from being wrong in the past about people whom I

London in 1991. I remember my wife and I being warned that the British

So with my confession out of the way, it is with some apprehension
that I have to stereotype retail currency traders. However, it is also done
with more than 10 years of knowledge from monitoring retail currency

The major currency pairs are quoted for trading in a consistent, uni-

Theconventionisthatthevalueofthebasecurrencyremainsconstantat
1.0000. The value of the counter currency is floating. As a result, a price
of 1.3512 would imply that 1.3512 U.S. dollars are equivalent to 1.0000

The JPY, CHF, and CAD pricing conventions are reversed versus the
U.S. dollar. For these currency pairs, the USD is the base currency (i.e.,
USDJPY, USDCAD, and USDCHF) and the foreign currency is the counter
currency. As a result, the price of the currency pair is in terms of how
many foreign currency units it would take to buy or sell 1.0000 U.S.
dollar.

If there were no bid-to-ask spread, the 50-50 probability of making a
piporlosingapipfromastandingstartwouldbecorrect(allthingsbeing

isa bid-to-ask spread that skews the odds forsuccess slightlyagainst the
trader. This spread is the property of the market makers or brokers who
quotethemarketprices24hoursaday,5daysaweek.
For example, the EURUSD, which is the most liquid currency pair,
tends to trade at around a two-pip bid-to-ask spread. Assume the current
priceinthemarketis1.3510Bid/1.3512Ask(seeTable1.1).Ifatraderflips

If the deal were immediately liquidated, the best the trader could do
would be to sell at the bid price of 1.3510. If this were done, the trader
wouldincuratwo-piplossonhislongposition.
Taking a two-pip loss is not the definition of successful trading. A
trader needs to make a profit to be successful. So where would his long
positionbeprofitable?
To make a profit of one pip, the trader would need the bid price to
move up to 1.3513. This would be the minimum price that would guaran-

average for traders. On the 84 trading wins, the cumulative wins would
resultin84pipsofprofit(84trades×1pipgain=84pips).
The losses for the remaining 16 trades would cumulate to minus 80
pips(16trades×−5pips=−80pips).
A win/loss rate of 84 percent would be needed to eke out a four-pip
gain.Youarenotexactlylightingtheworldonfirewiththoseresults.

To prove it, take a win/loss percentage of just .400 with 40 wins and

THEY HAVE TOO MUCH FEAR
Another characteristic I often find among retail currency traders is they
assumetheywillhavelittleornofearoftrading.Itmaybea“macho”thing
tothinkthisway,butIcantellyouitissimplynottrue.
Most retail traders have fear, whether they realize it or not, and iron-
ically, fear does not simply manifest itself in terms of losing money. It
also is prevalent when most traders are winning. In fact, it is the fear of
success—asIliketocallit—orfearfromprofitsthatleadstoretailtraders

thought that the market price will move opposite to the trader’s position.
What most retail traders don’t realize is the inherent fear they will have
simplyfromthevolatilepriceaction.
As even the most novice of currency traders realize, prices do not al-
waysmoveinaconsistentdirectioninthecurrencymarket.Thatis,prices
move sporadically at times. In a normal market the price may go from
1.3512 to 1.3511, to 1.3510, back to 1.3511, up to 1.3512, back down to

Know What Causes Your Fear
Fear is an emotion that traders need to control but most cannot or don’t
know how to. Most traders do not understand fully what causes the fear.
Not knowing what causes fear makes figuring out ways to control it diffi-
cult,ifnotimpossible.
Understanding that currency trading is like roulette on steroids is a
step in the direction of understanding, facing, and controlling one aspect
oftraders’fear.Ifyouknowthatthemarketwillfluctuateandnotjustgo

If I were to bucket retail currency traders over the course of one
month, there is likely a group of 68 percent or so who lose money. The
next 27 percent of traders could be broken into 13.5percent who make 1

are the 2.5 percent who make 6 to 10 percent and finally 2.5 percent who
hitthehomerunsandmakemorethan10percent.
The buckets are likely to include different traders each month. This
will tend to make the numbers skew even more to the negative over an
extended period of time. That is, someone who made a small percentage
one month could lose a greater percentage the next month and be down
overall.

Why do I use technical analysis over fundamental analysis? There is
one simple reason. Technical analysis can always tell you what the “full”

THEY DON’T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT KEY
FUNDAMENTAL REQUIREMENTS
How can I say retail traders are too fundamental and then say they don’t
know enough about fundamentals? Hear me out before you close the
book.
The distinction is that I firmly believe traders should not base trad-
ingdecisionsonthefundamentals, buttheyshouldnotbetotallyblindto
fundamentals, either. For example, not knowing that U.S. unemployment
figures are due for release at 8:30 AM EST is an example of being totally

P1: OTA

StereotypingtheRetailCurrencyTrader 35
blind to the fundamentals and irresponsible as a trader. If risk is increased,
traders should be aware of that risk and, if need be, refrain from trading
until more normal risk levels return.
Technicals will tell the true market bias story all the time, but there are
fundamentals that certainly can help the retail currency trader judge risk,
prevent stupid trades, and give a bullish or bearish bias for a trend type
move. In the next section I will give a broad stroke lesson on fundamen-
tal influences and point out some influences that retail traders should be
aware of and prepared for.
Economic Statistics
Each month a collection of economic statistics are compiled by each coun-
try or region (such as the Eurozone). The values, which are normally pub-
lished on a month on month (MoM) and year on year (YoY) basis, are re-
leased according to a specific schedule. The important thing to note is there
is a calendar of economic releases.
In the United States, economic statistics are generally released at
8:30 AM,9:15 AM, or 10:00 AM EST. There can be some minor exceptions. In
other countries and the Eurozone the releases are also generally released
at set times. In the U.K. and Eurozone, for instance, the normal times for
release are at 9:00 to 10:00 AM GMT.
The statistics are compiled from various sources. For example, the
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (www.bls.gov) compiles the weekly and
monthly U.S. Unemployment statistics. The U.S. Commerce Department
(www.commerce.gov) will release statistics like Retail Sales, Durable
Goods Orders, GDP, and the U.S. Trade Balance.
In the Eurozone, Eurostat (http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu) releases
most of the statistics for the EU.
Each country’s statistics can be found online. Some can be found at
the central bank’s site. Others are found elsewhere. Below are the main
country websites that show key economic statistics. Bookmark them on
your computer and visit them. They are good sources to see how macro-
economic trends for a country are shaping up. However, do not base trad-
ingdecisionssolelyonthedata.

Daily Economic Releases
The majority of the global economic releases are compiled on a monthly
basis, but there are some that are quarterly releases, like GDP, and a few
that are weekly, like the U.S. Initial Claims for Unemployment.
Most of the releases are lagged. For example, the U.S. Retail Sales
release would be the change for the month preceding the release date.
Most of the releases are revised and seasonally adjusted. The seasonal
adjustments can also be revised each year, which can make the original
number a shadow of its original self. Does that matter for your trading?
Not really, as trading is about what we know now versus expectations. If
the fundamentals paint a different picture of today six months from now,
it does not matter.
It’s important for retail traders to know that major news services will
often have an estimate of the daily releases compiled from surveys of chief
economists from global banks. The economists employ statistical modeling
in their analysis and are well versed in the nuances of the data.
Most traders will use the estimates as the benchmark to base bullish or
bearish sentiment after data is released. That is, if the U.S. Nonfarm Pay-
roll change in jobs is expected or forecast to show a gain of 100,000 jobs
and the actual data shows a gain of 150,000 jobs, that number is stronger
than expectations and the market should act accordingly. I would anti-
cipate that the dollar should get stronger. The fundamentals from the data
don’t necessarily guarantee a move in the anticipated direction as there are
other influences for direction other than the economic number. Plus, one
never knows if the number was fully discounted by the market already.
Most retail currency brokers will review the key economic events and
releases each day on their websites (I know I do). In addition, most will
also have a calendar of economic releases along with the estimates from a
surveyofeconomists.

because he thinks it will show a strong +250,000 jobs when the survey
of economists says it will be +75,000 is just betting black on the roulette

Central Bank Influences
Central bank influences include interest rate changes, comments from
key central bank figures like the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben
Bernanke,orthepresidentoftheECB,Jean-ClaudeTrichet,anddirectcur-
rencyintervention.
In the 2008−2010 period, the central banks of the world also became
more entrenched in other nontraditional stimulative measures, including
theuseofquantitativeeasingwherebypurchasesoffinancialinstruments

schedule. The significance of the comments can generally be tied to where
the economy is in the business cycle and the topic of the comments. If the
market perceives the economy is at a turning point, the risk from the com-
ments increases in significance. If, however, comments are made during
the normal midcycle period, they often tend to sound like comments made
previously and are less important.
As mentioned, most interest rate decisions from central banks usu-
ally come with published comments. In recent times, the comments
have come under microscopic scrutiny from financial wordsmiths who
dissect—sometimes word for word—what is released and what it implies
about future monetary policy action.
The U.S. Federal Reserve purposely worded comments that rates
would remain low for an “extended period of time” during 2009 and 2010
(and likely into 2011 too). This was done to assure the market that a tight-
ening was not imminent even if the economy improved.
The Bank of Canada used a more direct approach. In its comments
starting after its April 2009 meeting, bankers said the overnight rate “can
be expected to remain at its current level until the end of the second quarter
of 2010.” Rates stayed the same until the second quarter of 2010.
One problem retail traders experience with comments from central
bank officials is they often do not have access to the comments—especially
those from interviews. The cost of real-time headline news is often pro-
hibitive for retail traders. This is a risk traders face and quite frankly noth-
ing can be done. However, like economic releases, moves may be antici-
pated by knowing the schedule and taking into consideration any risk. A
surprise comment with no warning obviously cannot be anticipated but it
will be reflected in the market move, often within seconds.

Intermarket Influences
Intermarket influences such as stock markets and prices of commodities
such as gold, copper, silver, and oil can affect the value of currencies.
Generally speaking, the commodity prices of gold, copper, silver, and oil
will have an influence on the commodity currencies. These include the
Australian and Canadian dollars and to a lesser extent the New Zealand
dollar. Needless to say, these countries are reliant on the exporting of

commodities and therefore their currency value becomes tied to them. If

moditiesaregoingdown,thecommoditycurrenciestendtogodown.
The stock market is another intermarket influence on currencies, but

what became considered risky currencies. Risky pairs included anything
withyen,suchasUSDJPY,GBPJPY,EURJPY,CHFJPY,andAUDJPY.The
British pound; euro; and commodity currencies like the Australian, Cana-
dian and New Zealand dollars also tended to benefit from the move into
riskycurrencies.
Conversely, a decline in the stock market led to a flight into quality,
with quality defined as anything with the Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and
U.S. dollar, in that order. The other currencies all declined, including the
euro,poundsterling,Canadiandollar,Australiandollar,andNewZealand
dollar.

Traditional Foreign Exchange Influences
There are natural foreign exchange uses that affect the value of currency
rates. For example, Coca-Cola is a multinational corporation that may
look to remit foreign currency back to the United States periodically.

mightface.Inmytradinganalysis,Ialwaysbalancethecurrentpricewith

able to sustain a corrective move of this magnitude without closing out

there were signs the pair might be bottoming or at a significant support

2009low-to-hightradingrange.
As shown in Figure 2.1, the day before the article was printed, the

Most retail currency traders suffer from trading too much and not
watching the market flow or rhythm enough. The currency market tends
to have a rhythm to it. That rhythm can change just like the rhythm of

The first rule of risk requires traders to take responsibility for their

In life, and, yes, in trading, you need to take responsibility for all of your
actions.Intrading,itiscalledastoploss.Thisdefinesyourspecificrisk.
Successful traders get used to doing those trades that they see as be-
ing profitable. They also look to do trades at levels that limit their risk.
That risk is often defined to a specific price. The reason the level is so
specific is that successful traders will tend to look to trade at prices near

turning points—near levels that I call borderlines. Borderlines are price
levels where there is a sound reason (or reasons) for the market’s bias
to be bullish (or bearish) at one price, and bearish (or bullish) if the
price moves through that price. By doing this, borderlines keep risk to a
minimum.
I will discuss more about those low risk price areas—borderlines—
later in the book. The important thing to learn now is successful traders

Thesecondrule,“Iftheriskistoogreat,don’tdothetrade,”addresses
taking on too much risk. It also addresses what I call a trader’s worst en-
emy:fear.Youmayknowyourspecificrisk(thefirstrule)butifthatriskis

A guideline for most successful traders is to not risk more than 3 to

feel comfortable trading is 4 percent of your equity. With that risk profile
you should not risk more than $400 on any trading position ($10,000 ×

Duringmosttimes,themarketdoesnotmovefastenoughforthe$400

an important economic report can come out that might send the price

Instead, wait and look todo thetrades near the borderlines where riskis

Jumping on the Bandwagon
Anothertimewheretheriskcanbetoogreatoccursafterafast-trend-type
move. Many beginner traders will look to jump on the bullish or bearish
bandwagonattradelocationsthatdonothaveacloseenoughstoplevel.
For example, assume the price of the EURUSD moves through key
moving average support at 1.3428 and moves rapidly to the current price
at 1.3370. You missed the initial break, but don’t want to miss out on the
restofthemove.YoudowhatIcallthe“bandwagontrade”bysellingwith-

worried;afterall,themarkethasbrokensupport.However,yourtradingis

What often happens after a sharp directional move isthat the market
stabilizes, reverses, and corrects higher. We have all experienced this. It
isasifthemarketwaswaitingforyoutopanicandenter.Thecorrection
is slow at first but then starts to ratchet higher. When the market moves

and your mind starts to think toward limiting the loss rather than mak-
ing a profit. You hope for a 15-pip move down so you can book a modest
$150loss.
Sincehopeisfordopes,thepricegodswillpushthepriceupto1.3412.
You are down $420, which would be your limit on a normal trade (4 per-
cent). Your internal trading clock says, “I am at my limit.” Instead, your
stop is still 14 pips away, another $140. The market moves up to 1.3420,
comes down to 1.3412. You close the trade out (out of fear) for a loss of
$420. The price moves up to 1.3420 one last time, but then reverses and
continues the trend to the downside. The market moves back below the

The better approach would be to wait for an opportunity where you
can define a risk that is more congruent with your risk tolerance. Wait. If
you missed the bandwagon, don’t try and jump on it. Wait to trade near
theborderline.Yourriskwillbemorecomfortable.Youaremorelikelyto
be able to live through the corrections if you are more comfortable with
yourrisk.
Whenever I speak to traders, I tell them there is only one thing I can
100 percent guarantee them. That is, that there will always be another
trade. Successful traders adhere tothese rules and as aresult, they avoid
the accidents of trading. They also learn to quickly define and limit their
risks.

graduate assistant had a keen understanding of the team’s strengths and

plangoesawry.Tradingplanshavethestoplossaspartoftheplan.It

So the fifth attribute of a successful trader is the ability to control
fear—an attribute rooted in taking care of attributes 1 to 4. If you take
care of 1 to 4, you will have less fear. Most traders know about the fear
of failure, but there is another fear retail traders tend to have: the fear of
success.Let’stakeaquicklookatboth.
I certainly remember my early days as a trader when I would finally

6. BE GREEDY ENOUGH
The point is, ladies and gentlemen, that greed, for lack of a better
word,isgood.
—GordonGekko,WallStreet
In the 1987 Oliver Stone film Wall Street, Michael Douglas, playing
Gordon Gekko, said these oft-quoted words that have since become the
referenceforexcessofgreed—especiallyinthefinancialmarkets.
Tosaythatgreedisgoodafterwhathashappenedtothefinancialfoun-
dationoftheglobaleconomyishardtojustify.Greedplayedamajorrolein
thehousesofcardsinthefinancialmarketsbeingbuiltandinthosehouses
eventually falling down. Along the way, many benefitted financially. The
ones who haven’t necessarily suffered have been the ones who were the
greediest,thegluttons,theravenous,andtheself-indulgent.
Think of the housing bubble in the United States. Who is to blame?
Doyoublamethemortgagebrokerswhowrotetheno-money-downloans?
Theybenefittedgreatlyfromthewritingofthemortgages,takingfeesalong

cess?Theycouldhaverefrainedfrommakingtheriskierloansortheloans
thatleveragedthedebthigher.
How about Wall Street, which bundled the mortgages up and sold
them off to insurance companies, pension funds, and state and local

P1:OTA

governments? This group collected massive fees bundling and selling the
securities with no consequence, and in the process encouraged the mort-
gagebrokerstodomorebecausemoremeantmorefeesforthem.
Other greedy contributors on Wall Street were the massive internal
mortgage-backed securities positions taken on by trading desks within
the financial institutions. These positions put the firm and the depositor’s
money at tremendous risk. There was no trading plan. Most did not re-
ally know the extent of the risk. They clearly violated attributes 3 and 4
neededtobeasuccessfultrader.Moreover,theyprovedtheydidnothave
the skill or aptitude for doing their job, given the risk they were taking.
Of course, during the run-up, the gains beget more and more greed and
moreandmoreprofit.Massivebonuseswerepaidfortheearnings.During
the sell-off, those bonuses may have been reduced, but the damage was
donethatcrippledtheveryfoundationoftheglobalfinancialindustry.The
repercussions will indeed be felt for years if not decades to come. Could

Thegreedfromtherealestatedebaclewasdevastating.Theexamples

tionsalongtheway.Somemayarguethattheyultimatelypaidintheform

along with their cash salary and bonuses. That is true. However, the job
they lost and the stock options that became worthless were also at the
expenseofthelostjobsofmanymorepeople.Therewereveryfewbenefi-
ciariesfromthegreedthattookplace.
So how then can greed be good in currency trading? Does not Wall
Street tell us that “bulls and bears get rich but pigs get slaughtered?”
Doesn’t this seemingly universally accepted trader axiom speak directly
togreed?Ithinkthesayingisnotsomuchatruismthatalltradersshould

To illustrate, Figure 2.2 is the same EURUSD used earlier to demon-
stratewhatgoesthroughthemindofatraderwhohasthefearofsuccess.
In this case, I will explain the thought processes for a smart trend trader
who has greed. Like the other trader, this trader gets short at 1.3485 too.
He realizes, however, that the market is poised for a trend-type move. I
will refrain from telling why at this point in the book, but I will explain
whylater.

As the time goes by, the trend trader—still looking for trend move—
can move the stop down to 1.3453, which is above the first support level,
or alternatively use a move back above the moving average line to stop
the position out. The stop levels do not get triggered as the price contin-
ues its moves lower. Instead, the trader is rewarded with another leg to
the downside that takes the price down to the 1.3355 low, an impressive
129pipsfromtheentrylevel.Thetrendtraderisplayingwiththehouse’s

The gain is made because he anticipated a trend move, because he

and had just enough greed to fatten his account. When the market could
not go any farther and the bias turned bullish by going above the 100 bar
moving average, he “slaughtered” the position and booked the profit.
Bulls and bears make money, but pigs can and do get fat before getting
slaughtered.
Greed can indeed be good as long as the prior five attributes of suc-
cessfultradersarefirmlyinplace.Tradersneedtodeveloptheirskillsand
aptitude in order to create the desire to do better. They need the desire
so they practice and begin to firmly understand markets and have a feel

The Mission
Statement
B
efore Mission Impossible was a series of movies starring Tom
Cruise, it was a television show. The program started with a tape
recording that detailed a mission for Mr. Phelps, played by actor
Peter Graves. The distinctive recorded voice would say “Your mission,
should you decide to accept it . . .” with a brief explanation of the goal
ofthemission.Thefinalwordswouldwarn“thistapewillself-destructin

wasdestroyed.

In currency trading there is usually no team. By and large, trading is
a lonely business. Most retail traders don’t have physical face-to-face hu-
mancontactwithothertraders.Inrecentyearstherehasbeenmorecon-
tact through message boards, but most participants are anonymous, just

I am not all that surprised by the loneliness of trading. Let’s face it,
tradingcanbehumbling.Losingisunavoidable,andmostpeopleshyaway
frombeingputinasituationwherebytheirfaultsaresoexposed—evenif
theyareoverallprofitable.
The fact is that successful traders can be wrong more than half the
time and still be profitable. That can be tough for some people who grew
up getting all A’s on their report cards, went to a top university, went to
business,medical,orlawschool,andarenowretiredandlookingtotrade
currencies. It is tough being wrong 50 percent of the time when in your

what either of us wanted. We realized that trading was not really a team
sportforus.
So if currency trading is not all that suited to being a team sport, do
westillneedamissionstatement?Ofcoursewedo.Infact,becausemost
retail traders trade as a team of one, it makes the dynamics of following

A TWO-PART MISSION STATEMENT
When I went about creating my mission statement for trading, I looked
at it as not some far-off dream that is something to achieve in the future
(i.e.,“Mymissionistomakeamilliondollars”)butinsteadapathtofollow
today,abroadguidinglighttowardsuccess,howeverthatmaybedefined
and accomplished. The mission statement is the rock that all else is built
upon.
So when I went about deciding on what my mission statement for
trading should be, I wanted to make sure it was something that I could
focus on each and every day. Of course I wanted to make it simple and
succinct—small enough to fit on a note card. I wanted each word to be
important.
Contrary to what some may think, a mission statement alone cannot
makeatradermoreprofitable.Afterall,mymissionstatementforgolfdoes
not automatically lower my handicap. Becoming a profitable trader is ac-
complishedthroughthingslikemygameplan,therulesIfollow,thetrading

“To Make the Most Money . . .”
If you are reading this book (and you are not my mom or a family mem-
ber), you either are currently a currency trader, have the desire to be a
currency trader, or perhaps just want to increase your knowledge about
trading trends. You heard that this book lays the progression down in a

This way of trading is not the way toward making the most money.

I will tell you all these things in a progressive step-by-step process,
but ultimately, you need to do it all. If you do, you’ll be a smarter trader
who naturally makes the most money, just like the mission statement
says.
Retailcurrencytradersneedtofocusonmakingthemostmoneythey
can each and every day given their abilities. The amount they make is
largely dependent on market and trading knowledge that they will learn
over time. It is unrealistic to think that someone will automatically be a

However, having a mission statement to make the most money does
helpfocusattentiononaguidinglight,ontherockoffoundationforyour

upon that rock. Traders should think and perhaps even say out loud, “My

First, it becomes a level to initiate trades with a reason. As we have
learned, successful traders often have a clear reason to do a trade. The

Smart traders in currencies trade for reasons. They don’t trade be-
causeofshort-termmomentum.Theyoftenlooktotakeadvantageofthe
momentum—don’t get me wrong—but they will have a sound reason for
the trade. Buying a break of a trend line is one example of a reason to
do a trade. It is also a clear borderline trade. When a trend line is broken
on the top side, it is a clue the market should go higher. The line from

Does “The Greater the Risk, the Greater the
Reward” Make Sense?
For anyone who has ever taken an introductory economics class in col-
lege,thereprobablywasapointwheretheprofessordrewtherisk/reward
profile. The graph of the risk/reward has reward/return on the x-axis and
riskonthey-axis.Theprofileisanupward-slopinglinethatsaysastherisk
increases,thepotentialreward/returnalsoincreases.Figure3.1showsthe
standardrisk/rewardgraph.
Most people are familiar with the saying, “the greater the risk, the
greaterthepotentialreward.”Thisisoftenthecasewhenspeakinginterms
of the risk from investing in bonds or notes versus investing in stocks. A
government bond has a yield and will pay that yield to maturity, whereas
a stock has a dividend yield but that may or may not stay the same, and
thepriceofstockcanfluctuateupanddown.Therefore,theriskishigher
for stocks, but the potential reward is also higher over the same life of
thebond.

and when compared to the yield on a bond, there is nothing guaranteed
with the currency trading return. So from an investment standpoint for a

Riskissmall.Rewardisgreat.
This idea runs counter to the normal risk/reward profile some retail
traders may think are the keys to success. Many retail currency traders
thinkthatinordertomakeagreaterrewardintradingtheyneedtotakeon
more risk. They need to have a position on during the more volatile/risky
economic releases like U.S. Unemployment. They need to use maximum
leverage. They need to have stop/losses 100 pips away to let the position
develop. All are not true. Successful traders focus on the least amount of
risk to make the most amount of money. They look for trends. They look
toanticipatetrends.
How Much Is Enough Risk?
Traders will often ask me, “How much risk should I take on a trade?”
Although there are books written on the subject of money management,
andthisisnotnecessarilyoneofthem,therearesomegeneralguidelines
forthemaximumriskatradershouldtakeonaposition.
The general rule of thumb per trade is 3 to 5 percent of the account
equity. Personally, I cringe at losing 5 percent. I think it is too much to

To demonstrate the power of trends, let’s look at three traders who
are very similar except for a few subtle differences. They all are patient
traders who look to make a profit that is a modest multiple of the losing
trades. Each has only a 33 percent win/loss percentage, though. That is,
theywinoneandlosetwo,inthatorder.Eachtraderdoesonly50tradesa

Let’stakealookateachmorecloselyandseehoweachdoeswithhis
orherrespectivetradingfortheyear.
Trader1startswith$10,000andwillrisk3percent,butwantsa7per-
cent return for a 7:3 risk/reward ratio. With his starting account, he will
risk$300or30pipswithonelot(tostart),tomake$700or70pipswiththe
same one lot. If his account is greater or less than $10,000, he will adjust
his position size so he only risks 30 pips and 3 percent but requires that
7percentor70-pipgain.
Forexample,assumehisaccountgrowsto$15,000.Hismaximumloss
on the next trade is 3 percent of $15,000. So 3 percent × $15,000 = $450
of risk. Since the trader will risk a set 30 pips per trade (he trades near
borderlines), he would do $450/$300 = 1.5 lots. A loss of 30 pips × 1.5
lots×$10/pip=$450maximum3percentloss.Onthewinside,7percent

70pips×1.5lots×$10=$1,050gain.
HowwouldTrader1do?
On a $10,000 starting account balance, the profit/loss profile would
show a maximum gain of $845 ($10,845 − $10,000) and a minimum gain
of $67.63 after 10 trades, a maximum gain of $1,369 and a minimum gain
of $483 after 30 trades, and a maximum gain of $1,918 and a minimum
gainof$989after50trades.Overthe50tradestherewouldbejust17win-

EVERY MISSION STATEMENT NEEDS A
GAME PLAN
A football coach might have as a mission statement, “To win the most
games possible, with the fewest injuries.” The first part is similar to mak-
ingthemostmoneyasatrader.Ifafootballteamdoesnotwanttowinas
manygamesaspossible(i.e.,makethemostmoney),itshouldnotplaythe

Contrast this to the “least amount of risk” part of a trader’s mission
statement. If you take too much risk, you will likely fail. Fear will be in-
creased.Sousetheleastamountofrisk.

Why Don’t Retail Traders Trade the Trend?
Doretailtraderstradetrendswell?Theanswerisno.Overthelast10years
in the currency business, I have found that most retail traders do poorly
trading the trends. What I see is also supported by generally accepted es-
timates for active traders. Although there is no proven statistic as to the
percentage of active traders who will ultimately lose money trading, the
estimatesdorangeinthevicinityofgreaterthan70percent.
The reasons are varied, but one can safely assume that it is trading
against the trend that tips the scales against most retail traders. Losses

usually are periods where the market trends intraday. When looking at

not make their lives complicated, but they most certainly make trading,

Most retail traders’ charts will have a Relative Strength Index

Convergence-Divergence (MACD) on them. They will have three to four
different moving averages and a Bollinger Band. They might analyze can-

coming up and down from all sorts of obscure angles. They will follow
oil, the S&P, and gold for the intermarket relationships. They might have
Bloomberg and CNBC on two separate television monitors. They might
subscribe to some premium news services and have 10 different books
on trading on their desks. I realize my book is adding to that pile, but I
hope it simplifies your trading thoughts and becomes the bible for your

Traders also have what I call the fear of success. This is a fear most
traders don’t know about, but which I think contributes to retail traders’
inabilitytotradetrends.IintroducedthisfearinChapter2.
Beforediscussingandexplainingingreaterdetailthetwotypesoffear,
it is important to realize that for a trader, fear is directly proportional to
risk—the second part of our mission statement. That is, if a trader’s fear
isincreased, trader’srisk islikely tobe increased as well, and vice versa.

What is also important to realize is the seesaw balance of our game
plan, which is “Trading the trends and keeping fear to a minimum.” Most
tradersknowthatthe“trendisyourfriend.”Whatmosttradersdon’trealize
isthatfearisatrader’sworstenemy.Fearmakesyoudothewrongthings.
It will make you scream and yell (inside, of course); it will increase your
heart rate; it will make you avoid trading; it will muddy your mind. If a
tradercanstaywiththeangelictrendandsteerclearofdevilishfear,there
willbeagreaterchanceforsuccess.
As already mentioned, there are two types of fear that retail traders
face. One is obvious. The other is not so obvious. The next sections will

waystoovercomethem.
Fear of Failure The most common fear that traders have is the fear
offailure.Asmentioned,thisfearisspecificallytiedtothenotionthatthe
trade initiated will lose money. I think some fear is better than no fear.
The trader with no fear is one who takes the stance that he is right, the
marketiswrong,andnomatterwhat,thepositionwillremain—evenwhen
itisclearlywrong.ThatisoneextremethatIdonotrecommend,asthere
usuallyisnolimittothelosssideofthetradingequation.
The other extreme is the trader who does a trade and almost imme-
diately wishes to have the opposite position. Invariably, this trader will
switch the position, close the position quickly, tell himself the position is
rightasawaytoquellthefear(eventhoughthefearisstillthereandhigh),
and keep a losing trade longer than he should. What he will not likely do
iskeepthepositiononforanextendedtrend-typemove.Heistooscared.

Fear in Action
I know what most are thinking. The old Wall Street truism that “No one
went broke taking a profit” makes my fear of success theory fail to stand
up. Admittedly, you are right if the trade is taken as a single event. If a
profitonasingletradeisbooked,itisanetadditiontotheaccountvalue.
However I like to add an addendum to that old Wall Street saying, and it
goes like this: “No one went broke taking a profit, but you can go broke
afterthenextthreetrades.”
How can that be? Let me explain. Trading successfully is a lot about
stayinginsynchwiththemarket.Itisaboutstayinginrhythm.Stayingon
thebeatandpulseofthemarket.Alotoftradershavethesellhigh,buylow
ideadownpat—especiallywhenamarkettradesinanontrending,defined
range for an extended period. During these markets, traders get used to
selling the high. They get used to buying the low. They are in synch with
the market. In their minds, the ranges are well defined and predictable.
As a result, when the price is at an extreme, they tend to take profit as

For example, assume a market is in a defined nontrending range and
the most recent move is to the downside. The trader has sold at a higher

I could not fault a trader from taking partial profit or even all profit
against the key support level. However, if the price moves through the
key level, the trader should realize that the short should be reestab-
lished. Why? The reason is that the 200 day moving average is another
borderline. Being below the moving average increases the bearishness.
The price is below both the trend line and the moving average. Make
sense?

to reestablish a short after taking a profit by buying? The answer is no. It
is hard to do that trade especially after buying and taking profit against
a key support level. Human nature says you should be buying the lower

It is my feeling that traders who make trading more complicated in-
crease uncertainty, and with increased uncertainty comes more fear. We
know that fear is a trader’s worst enemy. Fear makes traders do things
theynormallywouldnotdo.Traderswhocannotcontrolfearcannottrade
trends or stay on trends, and trends are where traders make the most
money. Traders need to focus on steering clear of fear. If a trader wants
to keep fear to a minimum, he or she should keep trading simple. Don’t

Is it worthwhile to try and predict the market bias by creating a pro-

bullish or bearish bias early? Many traders, including myself, have tried
to be smarter than the market, to preempt a market bias by trying to be
creative—tobetrailblazers.

All the influences in the market are reflected in the price. With that
price, it becomes as simple as listening to what the price is telling you
as a trader. If you use the right tools—the tools that the majority of the
marketuse—theywilltellyouwhatthebiasisandwhichwaythemarket

RulesforAttackingtheTrend 105
RULE 2: HAVE A REASON
TO PLACE A TRADE
In Chapter 3, I touched on this rule as it relates to the game plan. Having
a reason to trade instills confidence in a trader and makes it possible to
quantifyrisk.
Thereasontoplaceatradeoftenactsasareasontogetoutofatrade
as well. For example, traders will buy because the price moved above a
trend line. However, if the price goes above the line by 20 pips and then
reversesbackbelowthetrendline,thereasontotradeisnolongervalid.
Byhavingthereasontotrade,thespecificriskforthetradeisknown.
Aslongasthetraderiscomfortablewiththatmaximumloss,atradeshould
be executed with little fear. With limited risk and little fear, the trader is
morelikelytostayconfidentaboutthetradeandkeepthedooropenfora

tobearishorbearishtobullish.
For example, if the price of a currency pair moves below the 100 bar
MA, it should lead to further selling pressure as the bias switches from
bullish to bearish. A price move below the moving average becomes the
reasontoexecuteatrade.

directionwithouttoolsthatsayotherwise.
ComparingFigure5.2withthesimpledownwardslopingtrendlineand
moving average to Figure 5.3, a simple price chart, illustrates the impor-
tance of tools to aid in formulating a reason to execute a trade. In Fig-
ure 5.2 the price is trending below the trend line and moving average. In
Figure 5.3, there are no clues from the price other than that the price di-
rection is to the downside. The road map is clearer with the tools that
define the trend and provide the direction for following the trend to its
conclusion.

I have three requirements for the technical tools I use. They must be
trenddefining,riskdefining,andunambiguous.
Trend Defining
Thefirstpartofgameplanistotradetrends.Soitmakessensetousetools
that will help define trends. Most trend-defining tools use slope of a line
to define the direction of the trend. We already spoke of the 100 bar MA.
If the slope of the moving average line is positive and the current price
is above the moving average, the trend is bullish. Conversely, if the slope
of the moving average line is negative and the current price is below the
movingaverage,thetrendisbearish.Anotherpossibilityisthattheslopeis

risksothatlargelossescanbeavoidedandthefocuscanbeonattacking

trader.
Unambiguous

leastamountofriskandkeepfeartoaminimum,thenusingtechnicaltools
thatdefineriskmakesperfectsense.
The third requirement—that the tool needs to be an unambiguous
tool—needsafurtherexplanation.

toolusedgivesacut-and-driedbullishorbearishbias.
Anunambiguoustooldefinesriskandlowersfearintheprocess.The
reason is that successful traders tend to use the price levels from the un-
ambiguoustooltotradeagainst.Asaresult,theriskisdefined,andaslong
as the trader is accepting of the risk, fear should also be dispersed and
lessened.
Usingoursimplemovingaverageexamplefromearlierinthechapter,
thetradersellsonabreakofthe100barMA,anunambiguoustradingtool.
It is unambiguous because below the line means bearish, above the line
meansbullish.Therefore,usinganunambiguoustradingtoollikeasimple
moving average helps define risk, and with it fear can be minimized. The
requirementsofthegameplanandmissionstatementareachieved.
Ifunambiguoustoolsarewhatwewant,whatdoesanambiguoustool
look like? The best way to describe an ambiguous trading tool is to say
it is one that does not give a bullish or bearish bias. In trading, the main
ambiguous trading tools are the technical tools that give overbought and
oversold conditions. Saying something is overbought or oversold means
thatthemarketshouldgodown,ifoverbought,orshouldgoup,ifoversold.
Itdoesnotsayitisunequivocallybearishorbullish.
Moreimportantly,itdoesnotdefinerisk.Ifamarketissaidtobeover-
bought, there is nothing to say that the price cannot get even more over-
bought. If this can happen, where is the stop loss? Where is the position
closed out? There is no price for the stop. It is more of a guess. Guesses
tend to increase fear over time. Successful traders look to steer clear of
fear,notincreaseit.

The “If . . . Should” rule says this: “If the market price does ABC, the
price should do XYZ. If it does not, get out.” Filling in the ABC and XYZ
with a trading example, the “If . . . Should” rule would sound something
like this: “If the market price moves below the 100 hour moving average,
thepriceshouldcontinuetogolower.IFitdoesnot,getout.”
The rule seems simple, doesn’t it? However, by looking at each part
you can better understand the impact it is designed to have on a trader.

Successful traders, like the successful baseball player, process the
“If . . . Should” rule instinctively. They train their brains to think ahead,
to anticipate by using tools they believe in. They practice and hone their
skills. Then when they do a trade, they are confident but are prepared to
blame the market if it doesn’t do what it should do. They accept defeat
withoutfallingapart.Theyacceptlimitingtheirrisk.Theyhaveconviction

My friend Scott Barclay gave me the visual by comparing a trade to
traveling along a highway. If you are long and anticipating a trend-type
move, you are on the Bullish Highway. If short and expecting a bearish
move, you would be on the Bearish Highway. Along a highway there are
exits. The exits correspond to thenext target levels. The target levels are
keylevelsofresistanceifonaBullishHighwayorsupportifontheBearish
Highway.
Forexample,inordertocontinueinthedirectionoftheBullishHigh-
way, the price has to reach the next exit and go past. If the market can-
not get past that exit, guess what? Either the driver is stopped on the
highway—thebiasispausing—orthedriverhasturnedaroundandisnow

Specifically, one requirement is that the tools should help the trader de-
fine trends. If our mission is to make the most money and the game plan

The second requirement was that the tools used should define risk.

I like to tell retail traders to think of the fundamental inputs all go-

for a currency pair. That brew is constantly changing, with new ingredi-
entsbeingaddedallthetime.Asaretailtrader,youcanseeandinterpret
some ingredients. You see and know that retail sales came out stronger.
You see that the central banker said that it “would keep rates low for
an extended period of time.” You see the change in Nonfarm Payroll and
know that it was weaker than expected. Any one of these influences can

why the currency market is the largest market in the world ($3 trillion to

Now understand that all those traders and investors are looking at
a relatively small number of currency pairs. As a retail broker we have
around20differentpairswequoteourclients.Themajorpairsareagainst
the world’s reserve currency, the U.S. dollar. Those major pairs include
the euro versus U.S. dollar (EURUSD), the British pound versus the U.S.
dollar (GBPUSD), the U.S. dollar versus the Japanese yen (USDJPY), the
U.S. dollar versus the Swiss franc (USDCHF), the U.S. dollar versus the
Canadian dollar (USDCAD), the Australian dollar versus the U.S. dollar
(AUDUSD),andtheNewZealanddollarversustheU.S.dollar(NZDUSD).

traders trading a relatively small amount of currency pairs is a comfort
to me. I like the idea that there is a huge amount volume with a whole
lot of traders big and small contributing to those currency pairs’ price
movement.
Allthethousandsofcurrencytraders,focusingonafewcurrencypairs,
determine a price 24 hours a day from Sunday at 5 PM EST to Friday at
4 PM EST. That price has all the influences in our cauldron mixed up. All
the fundamentals are in the pot, the mergers and acquisition flows are in

Thenetsupplyanddemandfromthetraderscausesthepricetomove
either up or down. That price movement is moved by all the influences
that traders—including you—can see and not see. As a result, I think of
the price as the most important piece of information at any one moment
for traders. However, on his or her own, can a currency trader make
money trading the price movements and momentum? Let’s take a look
atthisidea.
Price Momentum Has Its Limits
The current price and price momentum, whether it be up or down, is im-
portant, but as far as its usefulness for trading, it has its limits. Traders
whowatchthepricecanseeorfollowthepricedirection.Manybeginning
traders will look at the price action or momentum and base trading deci-
sionssimplyonthatmovement.Ifthepriceisgoingup,theywillbuy.Ifthe
priceisgoingdown,theywillsell.Moreover,themoremomentumthereis
inaspecificdirection,themoreexcitedthetraderwillbeaboutgettingin
onthatmove.
As a result, the inexperienced trader will buy when the price has al-
readygoneupandsellwhenthepricehasalreadygonedown.Sometimes
itworks,andthepricecontinuestogohigherorlowerandthetraderfeels
happy. Sometimes it doesn’t, and the price reverses and the trader is sad
and often confused. “Why didn’t it do what it did last time I traded like
that?”thetraderwilloftensay.
Inreality,becausethetraderdoesnothaveareasontotrade,tradingis
random.Tradingisdonebecauseofthethrillofthetrade,thethrillofthe
momentum. It is similar to a gambler betting red or black on the roulette
wheeloverandoveragain.Thegamblercontinuestobetbecausethethrill
of the wins and the vision of the potential wins. There is no real ratio-
nale to think the next spin’s odds will be any different than the previous
spin.
Intrading,thetraderremembersthewinningtradestoo.However,un-
like the gambler who most likely thinks he is lucky when he bets red or
blackandwins,thehighfromtherandomwinsintradingisoftenbelieved
to be because of a trading aptitude and prowess. The trader thinks he is
fully responsible for making the trade and having a gain. They were good
trades. “Nice trade,” he says to himself, and often he cannot wait to tell
someoneaboutit.
In reality, the trader is likely more lucky than skilled. After all, there
was no reason other than pricemomentum ina direction todo the trade.

don’tlosealltheirmoney—tendtoregroupandrealizethatbuyingorsell-
ing market price momentum is not a way to make money consistently.
Whattypicallyhappensisthatfearanduncertaintyarejusttoohigh,luck
runsout,andlossesmount.
So instead of buying new highs and selling new lows with the price
momentum, the trader switches tactics and starts buying low and selling
high.TheoldWallStreetaxiomto“buycheapandselldear”becomesthe
newtradingstrategy.
Unfortunately, like trading price momentum, the strategy fails to ad-
dress what exactly is cheap and what is expensive. Moreover, there is no
reason to trade other than the price is lower or higher. In other words,
what is the stop level if a dip is bought and the price continues to make
newlows?Thetraderissupposedtobuydips,andmostwill,doublingup
on the position. The market moves lower, and they will buy another dip.
Pretty soon, the trending market to the downside leads to a large loss or
liquidation.
Of course, this strategy can work just fine in a nontrending market.
In Figure 6.1 the price is trading in a confined range for the USDJPY be-
tween 91.07 and 91.79. Buying at the dips and selling at the peak would

Instead, traders, like carpenters, like lawyers, like software program-

THE TOOLS
The next sections will outline the three tools I use to attack the currency
trends:movingaverages,trendlinesandrememberedlines,andFibonacci
retracements. In the subsequent chapters I will outline how you can use
eachtooltobecomeasuccessfulcurrencytrader.
Moving Averages
As introduced earlier, the moving average, or simple moving average, is
oneofthetoolsthatIusetoattackthecurrencytrends.InthebookIwill

Whenlookingatthe100barMA,theconventionforadailychartisto
say the “100 day MA.” For an hourly chart, the same convention is used.
That is, I would say the “100 hour MA.” For less than an hour chart, such
as a 5-minute, 15-minute, or 30-minute chart, it is not correct to say the
“100 5-minute MA.” Instead, I like to say the “100 bar MA on the 5-minute
chart”orthe“100barMAonthe30-minutechart.”Foraminutechart,the
conventionwouldgobacktothe“100minuteMA.”
From what we have learned, there can be many chart time periods.
There can also be many MA time periods including the 18 bar, 34 bar, 50
bar,100bar,200bar,andanyMAtimeperiodinbetween.

Trend Lines and Remembered Lines
In Chapter 5, Rule 1 was to follow the K.I.S.S. principle. That is, “Keep It
Simple to be Successful.” We also are fully aware by now of the require-
ments for our trading tools of defining trends and risk and being unam-
biguous.
The second tool that I use to attack the currency trends is about as
simpleasyoucanget,anditalsosatisfiestherequirementsofourtrading
tools. The second set of tools is trend lines and what I call remembered
lines. Most traders are familiar with trend lines. “Remembered lines” is a

Remembered Lines: Lines without a Slope Earlier I explained
how to draw a trend line by connecting higher lows for an uptrend and

For a bullish trend, the slope is positive or moving higher. For a bearish
trend,theslopeofthelineisnegativeandmovingdown.Thereisanother
typeoflinethatIdrawonchartsthatdoesnothaveaslopelikeanormal

is known to all traders as simply Fibonacci. Fibonacci (also known as
Leonardo Pisano Bogolio, Leonardo of Pisa, Leonardo Pisano, Leonardo
Bonacci, and Leonardo Fibonaci) devised a sequence of numbers used to
estimatehowapopulationofrabbitsmultiplied.Thesequence,whichhas
also been applied inotherscientific disciplines, has been adopted foruse
bythefinancialmarkets.
In Chapter 9, I will discuss in more detail the sequence of numbers
and the importance, but for now I will simply say that by following the
Fibonaccisequenceofnumbers,financialmarkettechnicianscalculatere-
tracement percentages. The use and acceptance of these percentages by
traders helped make Fibonacci retracements an important tool for mea-
suringmarketcorrections.
Thepercentagesusedmostbythemarketare38.2,50,and61.8.These
percentages are applied to any significant trend that extends from a low
to high or high to low. For example, if a low-to-high range extends 100
pips and then tops out, the 38.2 percent retracement would round to 38
pipsfromthehigh.The50percentFibonacciretracementwouldbe50pips
fromthehighandthe61.8pipswouldberoundedto62pipsfromthehigh.
Tradersmeasurethoselevelsfromtheextremeandanticipatecorrections
thatshouldpauseorstopatthoselevels.
Ifyoutrade,evenforashortperiodoftime,ortakealookatanychart,
what you will immediately notice is the market’s movements are a series
of ups and downs. Sometimes the ups and downs are more or less equal
toeachother.Thatis,themarketmakesitswayfromoneleveltoahigher

What They Do Fibonacci retracements are ways for traders to antici-
pate and measure a correction in a trending market. Since they are also
staticlinesonagraph,theyalsoareveryhelpfulingivingtradersborder-
line levels where they can execute low-risk trades. Traders can get on a
trend by trading against a Fibonacci correction level. They can also do it
withadefinedrisk.
Fibonacci retracements can also be used to trade the corrections or
counter trends. To do this, another tool, like a moving average or trend
line in conjunction with the Fibonacci, is often used. I will outline this
idea in more detail later in the book. I like to think of Fibonacci retrace-

Chapter 9 will take a closer look at the use of the Fibonacci retrace-
ments. For now, I will provide an example of the use of this important
tradingtoolanddiscusswhyitqualifiesasoneofmythreetradingtools.

On the corrective move to the downside in the chart, the price stalls
at the 38.2 percent retracement level at 1.2201. This level, like a moving
average or trend line, is a borderline. Traders who sold near the top will
takeprofitsonshortsagainstthelevel.Newlongsarealsolikelytobees-

In the example, the price consolidated at the 38.2 percent Fibonacci
level at 1.2201, but then broke through the level. This led to a quick fall
to the 50 percent Fibonacci area at the 1.2172 area (1.2166 was the ac-
tual low). When downward momentum slowed at the 50 percent border-

For example, if a market reaches an extreme and reverses the trend,
traders assume the correction will at the least reach the 38.2 percent
Fibonacci retracement level. If the correction stops or falls short of
the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level, it represents a shallow

What is important for a retail trader to realize is that retracements
are often where inexperienced traders start to trade against the trend
and where losses start tomount. Remember, most money is lost by retail
traders trading against the trend. Retracements often kick-start that pro-
cess.
As a result, be aware that retracements are indeed an integral part of

I have a trading law, which is my cornerstone for anticipating a cur-

and nontrending. A nontrending market transitions into trending market.
Atrendingmarkettransitionsintonontrendingmarket.”
ThatsoundsalittlelikeNewton’sFirstLaw.Infinancialmarketterms,
the law could be rewritten as: “A nontrending market will continue to
not trend until it is acted upon by an unbalanced net force.” Conversely,

This chapter will focus exclusively on the power of a simple trading
tool—movingaverages(MAs)—andhowitcanbeusedtoattackcurrency

thedirectionalbiasforapotentialtrendingmarketinmotion.
WHAT IS A MOVING AVERAGE?
InChapter6,Ioutlinedtheprocessforcalculatingamovingaverage.The
calculationdefinesamovingaveragelevel.However,whatexactlyisamov-
ingaverage?Let’sstartbylookingatthetwowordsthatmakeuptheterm.

eachincrementaltimedbar.Thatnewvalueiseithergreaterthan,lessthan,

goingup,thiscangiveanideaofthetrend.Thetrendmaybebullish.
The second possibility is that the new moving average value for the
newbarislessthanthepreviousbar’svalue,thustheslopeofthemoving
average line is negative or going down. If the slope is negative or going
down,thetrendmaybebearish.
Thethirdpossibilityisthatthemovingaveragelineisgoingsideways.
Thatis,thecalculatednewvalueforthenewbarremainsthesame.Inthis
case, the movement or motion suggests the market is neither bullish nor
bearish.Itismoreneutralornontrending.
Whenever I can define a market as being nontrending, I get excited
because my law says that “nontrending markets transition into trending
markets.”InNewton’sterms,anontrendingmarketwillremainnontrend-
inguntilinfluencedbyanoutsidenetforce.Iwilldelveintothisidealater
inthechapter.
Theotherwordthatdefineswhatamovingaverageisaverage.Anav-
erage takes a defined number of values and calculates a single value that
becomesarepresentativeforthatseries.
Ifyouhad100barsonachartandwantedtocomeupwithoneprice
that is worthy enough to represent those 100 bars, many traders would
suggesttheaverageofthose100barsisthatonepricethatismostworthy
of that distinction. However, when the 101st bar is printed, the first bar
drops out, the value of the 101st bar replaces it and the average changes.
Thenewvaluebecomestherepresentativeofthelast100bars.Theaverage
pricemoves.
Looking at each of the two words that make up the term “moving av-
erage”givestradersafirmunderstandingofwhatitrepresents.Sowhatis
a moving average? A moving average is a value that is in motion and is a
representativeofthemarketpriceoveraspecifiedtimeperiod.

This is different than the slope of the moving average being positive
or negative. The slope of the moving average being upward or positive
simply implies the market may be bullish. Since moving averages are a
lagging indicator, the average can take a while to change course or

How Many and What Type
I use two different moving averages in my analysis and trading plan. The
reasonIusetwoisbecauseIwantonetobewhatIcallthe“trigger”moving

The trigger moving averagedeterminesthebullishorbearishbias.If
the price goes above the trigger, the bias is bullish. It triggers a buy.

(cid:2)
The confirming moving average, for lack of a better word, con-
firms the trading bias. If the price moves above the trigger, and sub-
sequentlytheconfirmingMA,itconfirmsthebullishtrend.Iftheprice
movesbelowthetriggerMA,andbelowtheconfirmingMA,itconfirms
thebearishtrend.
Sincetheconfirmingmovingaveragecomesafterthetrigger,itmakes
that moving average a target for a trend-type move. It becomes an exit
on the Bullish or Bearish Highway discussed in Chapter 5 that, if passed,

WhathappensifthepricemovesabovethetriggerMA,butcannotget

price will either go back below the trigger MA or remain in between the
two moving averages, keeping the bullish bias intact, but the momentum
limited.Eventually,thepricewillbreachoneofthemovingaveragelines.
Obviously, if the price moves back below the trigger MA, the bias
switches to bearish and the “If . . . Should” rule goes into effect. That is,
“If thepricemovesabovethetriggerMA,thepriceshouldgohigher.Ifit
doesnot—thatis,ifthepricemoveslowerandbackbelowthetriggerMA—

Using 100 and 200 Bar Simple Moving Averages
Thenextquestioniswhatmovingaveragestouse.Thetwothatworkfor
mearethe100and200barsimplemovingaverages.
As already mentioned, I have a tendency to take what is said on the
business news channels with a grain of salt. I have already outlined how
most commentary on television is focused on fundamentals. Fundamen-
tals can be an ambiguous trading tool, and as a result, fundamentals can
increaseuncertaintyandthatincreasesfear.
Moreover,whenexpertsdotalkaboutmarketsontelevision,itismore
oftenthannotablanketreferencetounrealisticandshockingtargets.This
appliestocurrencies,goldandoil,andeventhestockmarketorindividual
stock prices. The EURUSD going to parity, gold going to $2,000 or even
$3,000 an ounce, and Google going to $1,000 per share are some of the
shocking comments thathave been bantered about inrecent history. Itis
oftenbasedonsomefundamentalbelief.Itisrarelyalevelbasedontech-
nicalanalysisorachart.
What I have found, however, is that if technicals or charts are talked
aboutontelevision,commentatorswillmentionthe100or200barsimple

atthemention—theywanttoknowthefundamentalreasonthemarketwill

Nevertheless, if a technical level is cited on television, it will most
likely be because the 100 or 200 bar simple moving average is breached
orbeingapproached.
Why do I recommend these two moving averages? The best I can an-
sweristhatagreatnumberoftradersfromaroundtheglobefollowthose

are two of those levels. As we have learned, if a level is a borderline, the
marketpricetendstoeitherholdthatlevelorbreakthroughthelevel.This
allows traders to quantify their risk. They know the bias is bullish if the
price is above the 100 and/or 200 bar moving average, and bearish if the
priceisbelowthe100and/or200movingaverage.
As a result, if they buy and the price goes below the 100 bar moving
average, they take the loss and close the position. If the price rises, they
knowtheylikelyhavegoodtradelocation.
Since traders are able to quantify their risk, their fear is dispersed.
Their risk is also limited. When risk is limited to a small amount, the po-
tential exists to earn a multiple of the risk taken. As long as traders are

The second reason I prefer the simple moving average is with regard
tothespeedoftheEMAtotheSMA.Ilikethepaceofthe100barMAinthe
currency market. The currency market tends to have a level of volatility
where having too fast a moving average will lead to more trades that get

I want to be aware when the price is trading around the 100 day moving
average. That level (which is at 1.5664) is the most significant borderline
levelonthatday.

A break and close below the key MA level is significant and likely to lead to a
continuationofthedownwardtrend—ifbroken.
IfIweretofocussolelyonthedailychart,arealistictargetonabreak

July 29, 2008, was the last time the price traded 1.5664. The price
bottomed at 1.2329 on October 28, 2008, for a total trend-type move of
3,335 pips in three months! Traders who were not aware of the daily
chart may have missed this key signal that should have solidified a bear-
ish bias—even for shorter-term intraday traders. Traders who recognized
the importance of the daily moving average level set themselves up to
anticipate a trend-type move to the downside, and, as always, the smart
traders, the traderswho areprepared and aware, reap therewards of the
knowledge.

Looking at the chart, the risk on the trade can be as low as 1.2293
where the floor and last low is found. It can be higher, perhaps a break
of 1.2300 (markets do find more buying and selling action against round

Thesubsequentsurgehigherabovethekey100andthen200barmov-

clues from the MAs, the 100 hour MA becomes a target; an exit on the
BullishHighway.Forthosetradersfocusedsolelyonthehourlychart,the

ANTICIPATING A TREND

can anticipate rain and bring an umbrella and raincoat so you don’t get
drenchedwhenyougoonyourscheduledsalesmeetingthatafternoon.
When you go out for the meeting, although it might not be raining,
clouds might be rolling in. You begin to anticipate the rain in your mind.
So you bring your umbrella and sling your raincoat over your arm. Your

anyprotection.

So although a good chunk of the gain would be gone, the reward of
a larger trend move is what is anticipated from the clues from the mar-
ket. Trading trends requires risking some profit for the chance of a much
greatergain.Tradershavetotakethatrisktostayonthetrends.
Another reason it is important to risk more on early corrections dur-
ing a potential trend is because it is much more difficult to get back on a
potential trend trade after taking profit. Traders who take profit early in
a trend—in our example by selling at or near 1.2343—are much more in-
clined to sell a new trend move high, then to buy new highs on a break.

Three’s a Crowd
In our examples, the 100 and 200 bar moving averages were near each
other,butnotnecessarilyequaltoeachother.Intechnicalanalysis,when
two moving averages converge at the exact same price point, it is called
a moving average crossover. A number of traders look for a crossover
whentheshorter-termmovingaveragecrossesoveralonger-termMAand
declare the market bullish if the cross is above or bearish if the cross
isbelow.
Figure 7.9 shows a 100 and 200 hour MA bullish crossover. The
crossover occurred at 1.2230. If I were to take this signal, where would
the stop or risk level be set? Off the moving averages where the signal is

generated, the crossover would be way down at the 1.2077 price area. Is
that the risk or stop loss? If so, it is too far away for me. I am not inter-
ested in risking 153 pips (1.2230 −1.2077 stop = 153 pips) on this bullish
crossover at least.
Is there a crossover that will allow me to trade trends and keep risk to
a minimum? Before exploring crossovers, I want to introduce an idiom.
Idiom is defined at www.dictionary.com as a “Group of words whose
meaningcannotbepredictedfromthemeaningsoftheconstituentwords.”
Anexampleofanidiomis“Itisrainingcatsanddogs.”
There is another common idiom that says “Two’s company, three’s a
crowd.”Thisidiomisintendedtorefertopeople.Iliketothinkthatithas
particular relevance for a romantic couple. If two people are on a date, a
third person is simply not welcome. That third person needs to go away.
Isitreallyacrowd?Notreally,butidiomsarenotmeanttobeliteral,they
justneedtobeunderstood.
The “three’s a crowd” idiom can be a good descriptive phrase for a
trend setup that I look for in my chart analysis. It is the phrase I use to
describethesituationwhenthe100barMAandthe200barMAconverge
with the market price. When the three key pieces converge, it is another

ost traders know about trend lines. However, a number of retail

Connect the dots by drawing a straight line. Even a preschooler can do
it,right?
Theideaofadvancedversusbeginnertradingstrategiesortoolstends
to get me a bit perturbed. Phrases like “Let’s have an advanced trading

teach something that isadvanced, itisnot simply because it isadvanced,

line?Theanswerisyes,itwouldbeacceptable,butitisnotnecessarilythe
righttradetodo.Againof70pipsisagoodgain.However,ifanyprofitis
taken, I would argue for only partial profit. There are several reasons for
thistradingjudgment.
One, since the trend is fairly new (70 pips), and the clues at the start
ofthetradewerethatthemarketwasnontrendingandthereforelikelyto
trend,takingthefullprofitisprobablynotwarranteduntilthepricemoves
abovethe100barMAatthe1.5509level.
The second reason is that in terms of risk, the worst-case scenario if
nothingiscoveredisaprofitof49pips(shortat1.5558−stopatthe100 bar
MA at 1.5509 = 49 pips). That is still a good profit and a multiple of the
initialriskonthetrade.Itisnotgreat,butitisgood,andmostimportantly,
it is a gain. Traders who get in the position to manage gains, and are not
forcedtomanagelosses,areaheadofthegame.
However, the traders who are most successful know that trends can
runlongerthan70pips.Theyalsoknowthatcorrectionscangathereven
more downside momentum if the price can test key levels, but hold the
levelandmaintainabearishbias.
Thinking of it another way, if you started your trading day at point 3
andsawthepricetestingthe100barMA,wouldyoubemoreinclinedtosell
orbuyatthatpoint?Iwouldbemoreinclinedtosellagainstastopabove
the 100 bar MA (risking 10 to 12 pips), and I think the smart successful
traderswouldconcur.
Iwanttotradetrends,andsodothesmarttraders.Justhoursbefore
the trend started, the market was nontrending. Little money is typically
made in that type of market. Traders are paid to make money. You as a
retailtraderhaveamissiontomakethemostmoney.Nontrendingisnota
good way to make the most money. The most money is made in trending

I will often look to buy or cover some of the short position. I tend
not to be too greedy. On the bounce back, I will look for realistic targets
and also look for the move to happen fairly quickly. The longer the re-
boundtakestodevelop,themoredisinterestedIbecomeintradingagainst
thetrend.
In Figure 8.5, the first two failed breaks of the trend line had modest
corrective moves of 30 pips once the price moved back within the chan-
nel. The third failed break saw the rebound move much quicker. It pro-
vided much more “you are right” feedback. In 25 minutes the price had
rebounded from 0.8803 to 0.8867 or 64 pips (see Figure 8.5). The correc-

This is fully expected as risk is defined. Risk is limited. There are plenty
of traders who see the line and will assume the limited risk to get on the
trend.
The trading lesson is that channels provide a nice highway with
guardrails to travel between. They provide both floors and ceilings. The

The main characteristic of a remembered line is that the price usu-
ally does not trade for long at the line. That is, the price is either go-
ing to find support or resistance at the level, or the price is going to zip

Sometimes it does both. In Figure 8.11 the EURUSD is in a nontrending
market. From February 4 to March 22, 2010, the price traded mainly be-
tween 1.3443 and 1.3786 or 364 pips. The inside range where most of the
tradingtookplacewasbetween1.3531and1.3696or165pips.Infact,only
two days, February 4 and March 17, did not trade at some point between

Doing this will preserve profit and hopefully accumulate additional
equity over time. However, corrections are, by definition, just a tempo-

point.

You might recall a relatively recent use of the Fibonacci sequence in
DanBrown’sbestsellingbookandblockbustermovieThe Da Vinci Code.
In the book (and movie), the protagonist uses the Fibonacci sequence to
open the glass scroll that provides the clues for the whereabouts of the
Holy Grail. As a trading tool, Fibonacci retracements may also be a Holy

The Fibonacci Sequence
The Fibonacci sequence is the basis of Fibonacci retracements. The
Fibonacci sequence is a progression of values that follows a discernable
numericalpattern.Table9.1showsthestartofthesequenceofvalues.

After 5 the numerical progression continues with the following se-

34 + 55 = 89, 55 + 89 = 144, and so on. As you can see, the birth rate of
rabbitsgrowsratherrapidly(notsurprising).
A mathematical mysticism in the sequence is seen when you take
two successive numbers—say 144 and 233—and divide the larger num-
ber by the smaller number. The value approaches the decimal from what
is called the golden ratio. The golden ratio, or phi (as it also referred in
mathematical terms), is a mathematical constant just like the more pop-
ular pi (3.14159265 . . .). The constant for phi, however, is approximately
1.6180339887.
So, taking successive Fibonacci sequence values such as 144 (at F )

chart. The financial market tends to use two other retracement levels for
market trends. Specifically, the38.2 percent andthe50 percent levels are
keylevelstomonitor.
The 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement is also derived by the
Fibonaccisequence.However,insteadofusingconsecutivenumbersinthe
sequence, the derivation of this value skips over one value, then divides
thesmallernumberintothelargernumber.Thesubsequentnumberyields
avalueofapproximately0.382or38.2percent.
For example, taking the Fibonacci sequence number 89 (at F in
11
Table 9.2) and dividing it by 233 (at F skipping F ) equals 0.38197 or
13, 12
38.2percent(roundedup).
89/233=0.38197 or 38.2%
Try taking F (377) and dividing it by F (987). Do you get 0.382 or

The minimal, or smallest, completed correction of the trend move
would pause at the 38.2 percent line. The middle, or medium, correction
move would stop at the 50 percent line, while a larger, more substan-
tial, correction would go all the way to the 61.8 percent line. The length
of the correction of the trend typically gives a clue as to the strength of
thetrend.

Trade: Buyers, looking for a resumption of the trend higher, buy at

off the borderline is convincing and strong. This is a clue the market is

Trading Countertrends
The second use for Fibonacci retracement levels is as targets for coun-
tertrend trades. I define a countertrend as a move that has the potential
to be more substantial in terms of pips than a normal correction. Typi-
cally, a substantial correction will come after a larger-than-normal trend

As an example, from November 2009 to June 2010, the EURUSD
trended lower. The high for the pair was 1.5144. The low extended to
1.1876. That is a substantial move of over 3,200 pips. Along the bearish

Despite the bearish fundamental backdrop, whenever a trend is well
established in terms of time and overall high-to-low trading range, and
there is no correction of the major trend of more than 38.2 percent, an-

The trend down took the price from 1.5144 to 1.1876 or 3,268 pips.

The final step is to look to trade in the direction of the countertrend if

Be on the lookout for these candidates, and be in position to trade the

Measuring Countertrend Targets
While the EURUSD is trending down, the smart traders will be thinking

Market Perception and Countertrends

Retail traders—despite the fact that they have a difficult time trading
trends—will often get caught up in the trend at the wrong time. For ex-
ample, they may recognize the start of the correction (or countertrend),
but instead envision a shallow correction that reverses quickly. In the

of the market momentum. That is, they are looking more closely at sell-
ingrallies.Meanwhile,thesmartsuccessfultradersarelookingtobuythe
dips and trade on the side of the countertrend move. The retail trader
tends to be out of step with the market’s true rhythm during a significant
countertrend.
Measuring where the market can go and saying (or at least thinking),
“Thismarkethasthepotentialtohaveanormalcorrectionto1.3124ifthe

traders. It helps reprogram the trader’s brain to think in terms of trading

It sounds obvious, but to trade any countertrend, you need to know
that the market has the potential to countertrend and that it has the po-

The move higher off the 1.1876 low has traders selling against the
1.2150 ceiling for two consecutive days. This was a low-risk trading
level for bearish traders (and the bias was firmly bearish). Selling
against the key remembered line at 1.2150 defines the risk. A move
above the line would be the stop on the trade. The reward would be
yet another new wave to the downside. Is there a reason to expect a

reason over time. I like to tell traders that “Tomorrow’s newspapers
willgivetheexplanationastowhythemarketdidwhatitdidtoday.”
For me, the reason is the price moved above the 1.2150 level. My ex-
planation will not sell any newspapers, but it is a reason that defines
myrisk(anddoesthesameforothercurrencytradersaswell!).

What is the potential? What is the risk and then let the fantasy either
happen or not happen. Unsuccessful traders will let the fantasy control
their emotions and forget about the reality. Take note of that important

USING THE TOOLS TO YOUR
BEST ADVANTAGE
If you can attack the major currency trends higher or lower, you will do
very well as a trader. If you can avoid the pain of the corrections and
reestablish trend positions at low-risk borderline levels, you will do even
better as a trader. If you can anticipate a countertrend and target profit
levels and profit from the trading against the trend, you will be a star of
currencytrading.
Fibonacci retracements are the hybrid tool that allows traders to use
thecorrectionsinatrendtotheiradvantage.

FIRST THINGS FIRST
Like anyone, if I do not have a trade on, I am searching for one. Trading
successfully is about being patient. The good news is I do find there are
opportunities most days to define risk, keep risk to a minimum, and exe-
cutesuccessfultradesthatmightnottrendforalongtimebutstillprovide
decent returns. I outline those on my commentary pages and in my daily
videoe-mailsforFXDDeachday.
The real money, however, is made trading the longer trends. Trends
are fast and directional and make traders the most money with the least
amount of risk. These are the trades that will make or break your year.
There are three steps you must take at the outset of any trade and they
are to define the direction of the trend (is the trend transitioning into a
nontrendorviceversa?),choosethecurrencypairyouwanttotrade,and
pickwhichtimeperiods(orcharts)touse.
Defining the Direction of the Trend
Typically,atrendtradesetsitselfuptotrend.Itdoesthisbynontrending.
The nontrending market will transition into a trend market. It still is the
bestwayIknowtoanticipateatrend.Ifamajorleaguebaseballplayercan
anticipate a fastball and get it pitched where he wants it, he has a better
chance of hitting a home run. The same is true for traders. Nontrending
marketsareawaytoanticipateafastball.
Not all trends last for hundreds and even thousands of pips. I never
know when a trend may end. I may trade a trend that only lasts a day
or even less. Even on the longer trends, there are of course periods of

Picking Your Charts
As discussed earlier in the book, I look at three time periods, or charts,
when I trade: the five-minute, hourly, and daily charts. Some people mis-
takenlythinkthatthefive-minutechartisusedtoscalpintraday,thehourly
isforintermediate-termtradingdecisions,andthedailyisforlong-termpo-
sitiontrading,butthatisnotthecase.

memberedlines.
When the downtrend ended in early June 2010 and the countertrend
started, the setup from Figure 10.1 helped guide the countertrend move
higher. The 100 day MA was an upside target. The market stalled at that
MAline(solidlineinFigure10.1),tradingaboveitandthenbelowitbefore
breakingtotheupsidetothehigh.

However, the market made its way to the level and beyond. A high was

From the high, the price moves lower, stalls at the 38.2 percent re-

of boxed area in Figure 10.2). The price finds support and tries to trade
backhigherbutfails.Themovetothelowstallsnearthe50percenttarget
level at 1.2604. Support is found against the key midpoint. Over the next
13 days, the price trades in a narrow range. It moves from the low at the
50 percent retracement level back toward the range high at the 1.2915 to
1.2931 area (this is the boxed area in Figure 10.2). From the high, sellers
reenter against the level and push the price back down. The price stalls
once again at the all important 100 day MA line. The market is mired in a
clearly defined range and is waiting at the 100 day MA until it decides its
nextmove.

The50percentretracementisakeyborderline(1.2604bullish).
The first key borderline is the 50 percent retracement level. The
level comes in at 1.2604. On the way to the downside (see inside the
boxedarea),themarketmovedbelowthislevelonitswaytothelow
at1.2586.

Does this break of the Fibonacci level change my perception of
the market bias? No. The break below the 1.2604 level was brief and
quick;thepricedidnotclosebelowthelevel.Sellersbelowthe1.2604

do what it was supposed to do (“If . . . Should” rule). What is of note
from the chart is that the day after the 1.2604 was broken, the price
lowwas1.2608.Buyersusedthelevelassupportandthepricemoved
higher. Hmmm, a clue. With the price above the 1.2604 level, the bias
isbullishoffofthatborderline.
(cid:2)
The 38.2 percent retracement level is a key borderline (1.2776
bearish).
The 38.2 percent retracement area from 1.2763 to 1.2776 is a key
borderline level, too. Look at the boxed area in Figure 10.3 and start
from the left edge and go to the right. There are seven days that got
within13pipsofthelevelandfoundsupportorresistance.Themarket
seemed to want to be above it or below the level. So not only is the
areaaFibonaccilevel,butIwouldalsodefineitasarememberedline
(or area). The price is currently below the 38.2 percent retracement,
whichgivesabearishbias.
(cid:2)
The 100 day moving average is always a key borderline (1.2657
bullish).
Although the price moved above and below the 100 day MA
throughout the boxed area, what is significant to me is the last four
days of trading in the chart. The first day had a low of 1.2676, which
wasthe100dayMAlevel.Theseconddaywenttoalowof1.2658ver-
susthe100dayMAat1.2669butclosedabovetheline.Thethirdday
had a low of 1.2663, which was exactly on the 100 day MA, and the
fourthdayhadalowof1.2643withtheFibonacciat1.2657.However,
thedayclosedwellabovethelevelat1.2709.
The failure of the last move below the 100 day MA and the move
backupto1.2709isabullishdevelopment—abullishclue.

Thehigh-to-lowrangeisatitsnarrowestsinceOctober2007.
Thefinalcluefromthedailychartisfoundinthehigh-to-lowtrad-

30-daycalendarmonthandfourweekendspermonth,22tradingdays

Finally, horizontal lines mark the ceiling over the last 22 trading days at
1.2931andthefloorat1.2586.
I strongly recommend that when you set up your three time period
charts, if there is a key level in play, like the 100 day MA, put a horizon-
tallineatthatpricelevelinyourhourlyandevenfive-minutecharts.This
way you are aware of the level when you are focused on the other time
periodcharts.
Of note in this chart is that I did not include a Fibonacci retrace-
ment. The market has been nontrending for a month and the inclusion
would simply clutter the chart. What trend is there to retrace if the mar-
ket is nontrending? Trend lines are also not effective when the price
is moving up and down like it has been doing in a nontrending pat-
tern. Horizontal and remembered lines tend to be king in a nontrending
environment.

a total of four separate highs that were rejected at that price area. This

The second borderline level of interest is the 1.2657 level. Note that

down to the 1.2657 level. I will look at this area more closely in the next

MA can be added to the list of key indicators that the market will
pay attention to on any break or failed break. With three successive
tests in three days and the flatness of the line, it has the character-
istics of a remembered line and trend line. Any upside break of the
level going forward will be a clue for a bullish move, while any test
and failure to get through the level will be a bearish clue. It is a key
borderline.

“IS IT A BOY OR A GIRL, DOC?”
On Monday, September 13, in Australia, the currency market will open.
Withkeyborderlinesknownandinplace,thetradedecisionisdependent
on whether the market moves lower or higher. Which key level will be
breached first, and when one is broken, will there be momentum buyers
orsellers?
As a trader, I really do not care which way the market goes. When
the market is in such a state of confusion, it means the market does not
know which way it wants to go. Typically, at this point people will get
the loudest and pound their chest on the business news channels saying
thingslike,“TheEURUSDisgoingtotestthelows,”or,“Thedollarisgoing
to get hit in the last quarter.” Then you will get those who will say, “We
are in a range-bound market. I expect the market to stay between 1.2600
and1.2900.”
Yeah,right.Tradersarepaidtomakemoney.Themostmoneyismade
in a trending market. Even if it is 300 to 500 pips, the chances are it will
trend.Forme,myresponseis“Whetheritisaboyorgirl,Iwillloveit.”In
otherwords,letthemarketdecide.Itisnotuptome.Iamjustafollower.
ButIwilllovewhicheverwayitgoes.
If the market is going to trend lower, the price needs to break below

target and map the next levels higher. “Is it a boy or girl, Doc?” Hopefully,
the decision will come soon.
The next chapter will go through the trade entry and trend trade pro-
gression. The triggers will be triggered, the risk will be defined, and the
targets will be set. How far the trend will go will depend on the strength of
the trend and the ability to keep the bullish or bearish bias intact. What we
do know is the market is ready to move.

pectedittodo(i.e.,climbedto1.2794).Ithastrendedhigherawayfromthe
keyinitialresistance.Inoutliningtheprogressionandmanagementofthe
trend trade going forward, I will step through the initial legs of the trade.
The initial major target willbe the 1.2931 level. That iswhere we want to
go. The only way to get there is to stay with a bullish bias. Let’s see how
thetradeprogresses.
The First Leg: Risk Profit for Rewards
When I manage a trend trade, the goal is to stay on the trend as long as
possible.InordertostayonatrendIneedtoriskprofit.BythisImeanthat
there may be a correction within the early part of the trend that can take
unrealizedgainsfromanaccount.However,ifthetrendistrulyatrend,and
atrendisanticipated,thedirectionalmovewillbereestablishedbeforethe
biasischangedfrombullishtobearish(orviceversa).Thepotentialreturn
istherewardsfromasustained,directionaltrendmove.
Note the words risking profit. When you are on a trend there should
beprofitfromhavingapositionwiththetrend,evenifitistowardthestart
ofthetrend.Asaresult,theriskthattradersneedtotakeisintheformof
investingsomeoftheprofitinthetrade,notariskoflossfromthetrade.
Thinkofaretailbusiness. Mostretailbusinesses investsomeoftheir
profits in their business. The hope is that the money invested will lead to
greaterrewards.Itisnodifferentinthetradingbusiness.Ifyouanticipated
a trend trade and you have an early profit in that trade, you will need to
makeaninvestmentofsomeprofitinthetrendwhenthemarketcorrects.
The best investment traders can make when attacking currency trends is
riskingprofitwhenatrendtradeisanticipated.
If the trend is anticipated and the market appears to be obliging, be
sure that you do all you can to stay on that trend. You want to be greedy
becauseifthisisatrend,themarketwillgohigher.
I often feel that the first leg of the trend is often the most difficult.

higher. If it does not, think about getting out. Since the current price in

A dynamic of a consolidation after a trend move is that it allows for
the moving averages to catch up with the price. In this instance, both the
100 and 200 bar MA on the five-minute chart converged with the price at
around the 1.2975 level (see Figure 11.7). When this happens, I term the
setup“three’sacrowd”(seeChapter7).The“three’sacrowd”setupoccurs

the 38.2 percent retracement is a low-risk dip buying opportunity. It is a
borderlinelevel(Figure11.8).
Notethatinthiscasethereisasecondchancetobuyagainstthe38.2
percentretracementfortheEURUSD(seeFigure11.8).Thisinmyeyesis
a free trade. Buying at the level has minimal risk. The initial defined risk
wouldlikelybedownto1.2920(7to12pips)wheretherewereahighand
lowfromthepreviousday.If,ontheotherhand,the38.2percentretrace-
mentholds,theupsidepotentialshouldincrease.
As a general rule, an early trending market that corrects and holds
the 38.2 percent retracement is a low-risk buying opportunity. If the level
holds, the market will take that as a sign to restart the trend. Risk is 10
to 15 pips on the trade. The profit potential should at least take the price
back to and through the old high (i.e., 1.2909). If it does not hold (i.e.,
you get stopped out), that tells you something too. It could be the end
of the trend or at least a period of further consolidation. So watch those
early trend corrections to Fibonacci levels, and if they hold, that should
beagoldentradeopportunityandacluethatthetrendhasagoodchance

five-minute chart. In analyzing trend moves—especially multi-day trends
likeourexample—thefive-minutechartdoesplayavitalrole.Themoving
averages and Fibonacci retracements are key in tracking the momentum
and up and down rhythm of the trending market. The five-minute chart
showsthatthebest.

Fibonacci retracements are a less-useful tool in a sharp trend
move because the longer-term corrections typically do not approach the
38.2 percent retracement level. Down the road when the EURUSD trend
ends—and there will be clues from trend lines, moving averages, and re-
membered lines—the Fibonacci retracements will play a part in defining
theprofittargetforacountertrendselloff(seeChapter9).
From the start of the trend, the eight days in this hourly chart have
producedninedifferentkeyborderlinelevels(seeFigure11.13).Ioutlined

Borderlines still play a key role in the daily charts, too. At the begin-
