Foreword from the
Second Edition
I am a collector of first editions of books. My specialties include
astronomy texts written before 1900, such as Percival Lowell’s clas-
sic Mars, the first published speculations about the possibility of life
on the red planet (which inspired Jules Verne to write The War of the
Worlds), and a strange little tome from 1852 that claims astronomer
William Hershel spotted sheep on the Moon with his telescope.
My collection also includes about 200 business books written by
authors I have interviewed through the years. My inscribed copy of
Ivan Boesky’s Merger Mania,for example was appraised a few years
ago at $200.
But my sentimental favorite is a beat-up old chart book of the
Dow Jones Industrials and Transportation Averages going back to
December 18, 1896, the day the modern Dow Jones averages were
born. (Trivia question: Where did the Dow Industrials close after its
very first day of trading? Answer: 38.59). Back then, the Industrials
only had 12 components, and the Transports, with 20 issues, were
known as the Rails.
A 90-year-old FNN viewer from Virginia offered it to me in the fall
of 1985.
“I have been interested in, but not too active in, the market since
the early ’20’s” he wrote, “and lived through the ’29 ‘break’ and the
great depression which was a ‘tempering’ influence against excessive
enthusiasm.”

Foreword from the Second Edition
“At age 90 my activities are confined to ‘growth’ stocks and safe
investments. I am no longer interested in ‘speculation.’” So he won-
dered if I would be interested in his chart book.
Indeed, I was. I gladly accepted in exchange for a signed copy of
one of Joe Granville’s books.
The book was published in 1931 by Robert Rhea, the famed disci-
ple of Charles Dow and of the oldest form of technical analysis, the
Dow Theory. It covers the years 1896–1948, with each page devoted
to one year’s trading of both averages.
It is one big, faded green rectangle, measuring 11 inches high and
18 inches across. Its heavy cardboard covers are held together by a
couple of rusty screws.
I browse through it once in awhile, marveling at its simplicity.
Each day’s closing value is designated by a single horizontal hash
mark meticulously notched on the graph paper.
Nothing fancy. No intraday highs and lows, no trendlines, no
points or figures, just a simple daily record of the debits and credits
of civilization.
There is the market panic in December of 1899, when the Indus-
trials plunged from 76 to 58 in just 13 trading days.
There is the period from July to December of 1914, when, incred-
ibly, the market was closed on account of World War I. Eerily, half
the page devoted to that year is blank.
And, of course, there is 1929, when the Industrial peaked on Sep-
tember 3 at 381.17 and hit a bottom, three pages later, in July of
1932 at 41.22.
The book means a lot to me. Between its covers there is a bit of his-
tory, some mathematics, a dose of economics, and a dash of psychol-
ogy. It has taught me much about a discipline that I once considered
voodoo.
Good journalists are supposed to maintain an open mind about
the stories they cover. Political reporters, for example, should be nei-

Foreword from the Second Edition
ther Republican nor Democrat. And successful financial reporters
should avoid being either bullish or bearish. And they should also be
familiar with both fundamental and technical analysis.
I remember the first time I interviewed a technical market analyst in
the fall of 1981, when I was still cutting my teeth on business news.
This analyst spoke of 34-day and 54-week market cycles and head-
and-shoulder bottoms and wedge formations. I thought it was so
much mumbo-jumbo until the summer of 1982 when the bull market
was launched, and the fundamental analysts were still bemoaning the
depths of the recession that gripped the economy at the time. That
was when I realized the technicians may have something there.
He doesn’t know it, but Greg Morris taught me a lot about tech-
nical analysis. Or, more accurately, his N-Squared software did. For
a couple of years during the mid-1980s, I hand-entered the daily
NYSE advance/decline readings and the closing figures of a few mar-
ket indices into my computer. I used N-Squared to build charts and
draw trendlines. (I hadn’t yet learned about modems and download-
ing from databanks.)
The slow, painstaking process gave me a hands-on, almost organic,
feel for the markets. And watching various repetitive chart patterns
unfold on the computer screen was a great lesson about supply and
demand and about market psychology.
I think I understand how technical analysis works. It’s the why
that still puzzles me. I understand the supply and demand implica-
tions of support and resistance levels, for example, and I appreciate
the theories behind pennant formations and rising bottoms.
But I still marvel at what ultimately makes technical analysis
work: that intangible something that causes technicians to anthropo-
morphize the markets without even realizing it. The market is tired,
they say. Or the market is trying to tell us this or that. Or the market
always knows the news before the newspaper do.
That something, in my mind, is simply the human side of the mar-

ket, which I suggest American technicians tend to ignore. Technical
analysis is, after all, as much art as it is science. But too many ana-
lysts have a mathematical blind spot, and I blame that on computers.
Yes, charts represent numerical relationships, but they also depict
human perceptions and behavior.
Enter Sakata’s Candlesticks, which combine the highly quantita-
tive ratiocination of American technical analysis with the intuitive
elegance of Japanese philosophy. Greg Morris has more that ably
turned his attention to this fascinating charting style with this book.
It occurs to me that Japanese Candlesticks are the perfect form of
technical analysis for the 1990s. I happen to agree with authors John
Naisbett and Patricia Aburdene. It won’t necessarily be an overtly
religious period, mind you, but rather one subtle, intuitive power we
may all develop that allows us to sense things before they actually
happen. It will be a period that embraces a kind of hybrid Eastern
philosophy and Western practicality without all the New Age hocus-
pocus.
Just right for Candlestick analysis. The system is precise and exact-
ing, but it charms with its haiku-like names for charts patterns:
“paper umbrella,” or “spinning tops,” for example.
But I’ll let Greg Morris tell the story from here. I just hope my
90-year-old friend is still around to read it. I think he would like it.

Foreword for the
Third Edition
I got into the investment business when I was 21 and my timing was
impeccable. I opened my first office in June 1982 only two months
before the stock market embarked on an 18-year secular bull market.
(I thought I was the catalyst for the market’s improvement!) I was
young and knew everything—or at least I thought so. It didn’t take
long for me to realize that not only did I notknow everything; I actu-
ally knew very little. The investment world is a big place and the con-
founding truth is there is no single “right” way to do it. There are
many good ideas and strategies but none are perfect.
I considered myself quite mature at the ripe age of 21, but thank-
fully I was alone in that assessment. There were very few people
standing in line to get investment advice from a kid, which was a
good thing because as a result, I had little opportunity to do any
damage.
One benefit of youth is an openness to ideas, and by setting out on
my own I was fortunate to have escaped the traditional training of
the big brokerage firms. No one brainwashed me into believing their
way was the only way, so I was able to listen and learn without bring-
ing a lot of preconceived notions to the table. To use a good South-
ern phrase, “I wasn’t set in my ways” yet.
As we were in the midst of what would become the most unprece-
dented bull market in history, my first experience with a market hic-
cup was the 1987 crash. While the short-term effects of Black

Foreword for the Third Edition
Monday were emotional and nerve-wracking, it wasn’t long before
that cyclical bear market became additional ammunition for the fun-
damental, buy-and-hold crowd to espouse how “right” they were:
Every correction was simply a buying opportunity, bear markets
don’t last long, and losses are quickly recovered. I was drinking the
Kool-Aid.
The cyclical bear market in 1990 was similar to the 1987 bear—it
didn’t last very long and the recovery time was less than a year—but
itwasdifferent for me because by that time I had real clients with real
money! I was being asked real questions about ways to manage risk
in a portfolio and I didn’t have any answers. That’s when technical
market analysis finally popped up on my radar screen.
In 1991, Don Beasley and I formed what would become PMFM,
Inc., a registered investment advisor managing money using technical
market analysis. Our goal was to deliver reasonable returns without
the roller coaster ride and risks that come with buy-and-hold.
Technical analysis is still not “mainstream” because the buy-and-
hold approach is so much easier for brokers and financial advisors,
but in the wake of the recent bear market, investors are finally taking
notice. In 2000–2002 a ferocious bear kicked down the door and pro-
ceeded to destroy all those market “truths” that had been ingrained
since 1982. This bear market wasn’t brief; twenty percent drops were
not good buying opportunities; and the overall damage was severe.
Now, more than five years after the slide began, we are still a long way
from breaking even on most indices. Unfortunately it took the worst
bear market since the Great Depression to bring technical market
analysis the attention it deserves, but I am thankful that our approach
allowed us to preserve our clients’ money and actually post a positive
return over that dreadful three-year period.
Over the past decade, I have come to appreciate how vast the
study of technical analysis really is. There are so many viable models
and measures—some basic, some complex—but ultimately they are

just tools of the trade for a good technician. We all find comfort in
familiarity and maybe that is why Japanese Candlestick Charting is

information provided in this book is direct, easy to understand, and

Preface from the
Second Edition
Japanese candlestick charting and analysis is definitely a viable and
effective tool for stock and commodity market timing and analysis.
That is a bold statement, especially when you consider the universe of
analysis techniques that are being promoted, offered, sold, used,
abused, and touted. Other than Nison’s work, the only problem has
been the lack of detailed information on how to use and identify them.
Not only will this book solve this problem, but it will also provoke an
intellectual curiosity in candlesticks that will not easily disappear.
Japanese candlesticks provide visual insight into current market
psychology. There is no ancient mystery behind Japanese candle-
sticks, as some promoters would have you believe. They are, how-
ever, a powerful method for analyzing and timing the stock and
futures markets. That they have been used for hundreds of years only
supports that fact. When candlesticks are combined with other tech-
nical indicators, market timing and trading results can be enhanced
considerably.
It is almost regretful that this sound analysis technique was intro-
duced to the West using the word “candlesticks” instead of some
more appealing or appropriate terminology, such as Sakata’s Meth-
ods or Sakata’s Five Methods. If candlesticks’ Western debut had
focused on the uncovering of an ancient Japanese analysis technique
called Sakata’s Methods, I believe their acceptance would have been
quicker and more widespread. None of this, however, changes the

Preface from the Second Edition
contribution that candlesticks make to technical analysis; only fewer
misleading claims would have been made.
In January 1992, I completed a week of study in Japan with Mr.
Takehiro Hikita, an independent and active futures trader. While
staying in his home, we thoroughly discussed the entire realm of
Japanese culture related to candlestick analysis. His extensive knowl-
edge and dedication to the subject made my learning experience not
only enjoyable, but quite thorough. His insistence that I try to under-
stand the psychology at the same time was instrumental in learning
many of the pattern concepts. I hope that I have transposed that
priceless information into this book.
This is a book that not only covers the basics, but offers more
detail into exactly how to identify and use the patterns. A compre-
hensive analysis and recognition methodology will be presented so
that you will have no doubt in your mind when you see a candlestick
pattern. In addition to a thorough coverage of the candlestick pat-
terns, the philosophy of their use will be discussed so that you will
have a complete understanding of the Japanese candle pattern analy-
sis and its usefulness to market timing and strategies. Candle Patterns
need to be defined within parameters that people can understand and
use in their everyday analysis. This can still involve flexibility as long
as the limits of that flexibility are defined, or at least explained.
An attempt to take the subjectivity out of Japanese candlesticks
analysis will be primary thrust of this book. Most sources that deal
with candlesticks admit that patterns should be taken into the con-
text of the market. This is true, but is often an excuse to avoid the
complicated methodology of pattern recognition.
Chapters on statistical testing and evaluation will reveal, totally,
all assumptions used and all details of the testing results. Rigorous
testing has been done on stocks, futures, and indices. Some of the
results were surprising and some were predictable. All results are
shown for your use and perusal.

Preface from the Second Edition
There is nothing more tiring, useless, and inefficient than reading
pages of detailed analysis on chart patterns about how the market
was or what you should have done. The seemingly endless verbiage
about how you would have done if you had only recognized this or
that when this or that occurred is totally worthless. Charting exam-
ples will be shown in this book only as learning examples of the can-
dle patterns being discussed. It definitely helps to see the actual
candle patterns using real data.
I could not have allowed myself even to start a project as involved
as this if I had even the slightest doubt as to the viability and credi-
bility of using Japanese candlesticks as an additional tool for market
analysis and timing. Over the last 15 years, I have read almost every
book on technical analysis, used every type of indicator, followed
numerous analysts, and developed technical and economical analysis
software in association with N-Squared Computing. Believe me, if
candlesticks were just a passing fancy, this book would not have been
considered—certainly not by me.
I felt that a straightforward approach in writing the book would
be the most accepted, and certainly the most believable. When I buy
a book to learn about new techniques, a textbook-like approach is
appreciated. Hence, this style has played a vital part in the structure
and organization of this book.
This book will not only introduce and explain all of the inner
workings of Japanese candlesticks, but will also serve as a reference
manual for later use. Each candle pattern has been defined and
explained in a standard format so that quick and easy referral is pos-
sible. I will introduce a new method of analysis called “candlestick
filtering,” which, based upon my research, is essential for better
recognition. You will see it gain in popularity because it can provide
such a sound basis for future analysis and research.
Japanese candlestick analysis used with other technical/market
indicators will improve your performance and understanding of the

markets. Even if you use candlesticks solely as a method of display-
ing data, you will find them indispensable. Candlestick charting, can-
dle pattern analysis, and candlestick filtering will give you an edge, a
tool if you will, that will enhance your understanding of the markets
and trading performance. Learn candlestick charting and analysis,
use it, and enjoy its rewards.

Preface for the
Third Edition
The preface for the second edition still says most of the facts that
need to be here, with only a few changes and additions given below.
A number of new candle patterns have been developed since the first
edition came out in 1992. Many of these were created to fill the holes
in the original Japanese versions of the patterns. A large number of
original Japanese patterns did not have a complement or counterpart;
there was either a bullish version or a bearish version, but not both.
Those holes have been filled, along with a handful of new patterns.
When you study these patterns for all these years, one easily can start
to see how new things can develop. Steve North of North Systems was
the originator of many of these complementary and new patterns. If
you see these patterns in other books or articles on candlesticks, be
sure to ask the author where he/she obtained the information.
So after 14 years, what has changed? Computers are readily avail-
able; certainly computing power growth has exceeded even Moore’s
Law. Almost all data services offer stock data that has the open price
available. In 1992 that was definitely not the case, as I addressed it
in Chapter 6. The internet has offered charting services such as
StockCharts.com, that make the term software almost obsolete; all
you need is a browser. Intraday data is certainly more readily avail-
able. I still have a problem in using candle pattern analysis on any-
thing other than daily data. The Japanese believed strongly that the
time between the close of one day and the open of the next day was
important to investor psychology. The time between the end (close)

Preface for the Third Edition
of a 10-minute candlestick and the beginning (open) of the next one,
is just simply the next tick. Not a lot of time to develop a psycholog-
ical outlook on the market, is it?
So what has not changed? I still witness folks using candle pattern
analysis that seem to forget its one primary and most basic premise;
you must first identify the trend of the market before you can even
begin to find candle patterns. How can you have a bullish reversal
candle pattern if you not in a downtrend? You can’t. Remember,
these short-term views of investor psychology are based upon the
trend of the market.
I still hear and witness analysts making much more out of candle
pattern analysis than they should. It is not magical; it is not the key
to instant profit; it is just simply another good short-term tool for
market analysis and trading. Candle pattern analysis should always
be supplemented with other analysis techniques.
In this edition, I added considerably more information on the
measures of success for candle patterns relative to many other tech-
nical indicators. I also enhanced the statistics that support the candle
pattern filtering concept I introduced in the first edition.
I have also shortened my view on the viability of using candle pat-
terns. In the first edition I mentioned that they were fairly reliable up
to about nine market days. Today, I strongly believe that anything
over five days is coincidental and random. If a candle pattern calls the
beginning of the biggest up move in history, it is not the candle pattern
that causes it; the candle pattern only helps identify its beginning.
Finally, Ryan Litchfield contributed a much-needed section on
candlesticks for traders. If you are a trader you will love Chapter 10.

Acknowledgments
There are people without whom this book could not have been pos-
sible. Where do I start? Who do I mention first? This, quite possibly,
is more difficult than the book itself.
One must never forget one’s roots. There is no doubt in my mind
that my parents, Dwight and Mary Morris, are mostly responsible
for all the good that I have ever accomplished. Any of the bad surely
had to come from being a jet fighter pilot in the U.S. Navy for six
years.
I am blessed with a wonderful wife, Laura. Her support during
this effort was unwavering and fully appreciated.
Norman North (Mr. N-Squared Computing) has gone from a busi-
ness associate to a valued friend. His insight and opinions are always
sought and usually relied upon. The bottom line is this: without
Norm, this book would not have been written. Steve North (Norm’s
son) was invaluable with all the new material that was used in this
edition.
I am forever grateful to Takehiro Hikita for his gracious offer to
visit Japan, stay in his home, and help with the many Japanese inter-
pretations. My trip to Japan in January 1992 to study Japanese can-
dlestick analysis was invaluable. His knowledge of candle pattern
analysis is filtered throughout this book.
Ron Salter, of Salter Asset Management, has always offered an
unusual but insightful opinion on the economy and the markets, one
that usually seems to be more right than wrong. I am grateful for his
permission to quote some of his comments from his client letter.

Acknowledgments
Steve Nison must be given full credit and acknowledgment for pio-
neering “candlesticks” into Western analysis. His book Japanese
Candlestick Charting Techniques, published by New York Institute
of Finance/Simon & Schuster is a classic and provides the reader with
a rich history of candlesticks and candlestick analysis. Nison coined
many of the English names for the various patterns used in the West
today. Many of the concepts used in the West today originated from
Nison’s work and have been widely accepted as commonplace
among candlestick enthusiasts. This book does not try to change
that.
The first book translated into English about Japanese candlesticks
wasThe Japanese Chart of Charts,by Seike Shimizu. This book pro-
vided as immense wealth of information about all of the popular can-
dle patterns along with their many interpretations. It was translated
by Greg Nicholson. Another valuable source of information on can-
dlesticks was published by Nippon Technical Analysis Association,
called Analysis of Stock Pricein Japan, 1988.
My thanks also go to Chip Anderson and all the folks at
StockCharts.com for their assistance in creating most of the new
charts in this edition. Special recognition goes to Kellie Erlandson for
converting them into a usable format and never complaining when I
wanted to change something. Also thanks to Edgar Isidro for typing
the original book into Microsoft Word. I think I must have been
using a DOS-based word processor, or something long since gone
when I did the first edition in 1991.
Thanks to Jason Holcombe for reviewing all of my Japanese lan-
guage books in search of any new patterns and providing a few of the
translations for the new patterns.
Thanks to Raymond Fowkes for his expertise in generating the
Microsoft Excel tables that were converted into the Pattern Detail
Information Boxes in Chapters 3 and 4.

CHAPTER ONE
Introduction
Japanese candlestick analysis is a valid form of technical analysis and
should be treated as such. Promoters of instant wealth will always
misdirect and abuse their rights, but in the end, they are not around
long enough to cause any substantial damage. One should always
look into any new technique with a healthy amount of skepticism.
Hopefully, this book will keep that skepticism under control and
unnecessary.
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
When considering technical analysis, one should remember that things
are quite often not always what they seem. Many facts that we learn
are not actually true; and what seems to be the obvious, sometimes is
not. Many people believe water runs out of a bathtub faster as it gets
to the end; it doesn’t. Some people may drink like a fish, but fish don’t
drink. George Washington neither cut down a cherry tree, nor threw a
silver dollar across the Potomac. Dogs don’t sweat through their

tongues, Audi automobiles never mysteriously accelerated, and the
Battle of Bunker Hill was not fought at Bunker Hill (Breed’s Hill).
A good detective will tell you that some of the least reliable infor-
mation comes from eye witnesses. When people observe an event, it
seems their background, education, and other influences color their
perception of what occurred. A most important thing that detectives
try to do at a crime scene is to prevent the observers from talking to
each other, because most would be influenced but what others say
they saw.
Another curious human failing becomes a factor when we observe
facts. The human mind does not handle large numbers or macro ideas
well. That thousands of people die each year from automobile acci-
dents raises scarcely an eyebrow, but one airplane crash, killing only a
few people, grabs the nation. We are only modestly concerned that tens
of thousands of people are infected with AIDS, but we are touched
deeply when presented with an innocent child that has been indirectly
infected. If a situation is personalized, we can focus on it. We can
become deluded by our emotions, and these emotions can affect our
perceptions. When our portfolios are plunging, all of the fears that we
can imagine are dragged out: recession, debt, war, budget, bank fail-
ures, etc. Something is needed to keep us from falling victim to every-
day emotion and delusion; that something is technical analysis.
Almost all methods of technical analysis generate useful informa-
tion, which, if used for nothing more than uncovering and organizing
facts about market behavior, will increase the investor’s understand-
ing of the markets. The investor is made painfully aware that techni-
cal competence does not ensure competent trading. Speculators who
lose money do so not only because of bad analysis, but because of
their inability to transform their analysis into sound practice. Bridg-
ing the vital gap between analysis and action requires overcoming the
threats of fear, greed, and hope. It means controlling impatience and

the desire to stray away from a sound method to something new dur-
ing times of temporary adversity. It means having the discipline to
believe what you see and to follow the indications from sound meth-
ods, even though they contradict what everyone else is saying or
what seems to be the correct course of action.
JAPANESE CANDLESTICK ANALYSIS
As a new and exciting dimension of technical analysis, Japanese can-
dlestick charting and candle pattern analysis will help people who
wish to have another tool at their disposal; this tool will help sort and
control the constant disruptions and continuous outside influences
on sound stock and futures market analysis.
What does candlestick charting offer that typical Western high-
low bar charts do not? As far as actual data displayed—nothing.
However, when it comes to visual appeal and the ability to see data
relationships easier, candlesticks are exceptional. A quick insight to
the recent trading psychology is there before you. After a minimal
amount of practice and familiarization, candlesticks will become part
of your analysis arsenal. You may never return to a standard bar
chart.
Japanese candlesticks offer a quick picture into the psychology of
short-term trading, studying the effect, not the cause. This places can-
dlesticks squarely in the category of technical analysis. One cannot
ignore the fact that prices are influenced by investors’ psychologically
driven emotions of fear, greed, and hope. The overall psychology of
the marketplace cannot be measured by statistics; some form of tech-
nical analysis must be used to analyze the changes in these psycholog-
ical factors. Japanese candlesticks read the changes in the makeup of
investors’ interpretations of value. This is then reflected in price

movement. More than just a method of pattern recognition, candle-
sticks show the interactions between buyers and sellers. Japanese can-
dlestick charting provides insight into the financial markets that is not
readily available with other charting methods. It works well with
either stocks or commodities. Related analysis techniques, such as
candlestick filtering and CandlePower (candle volume) charting, will
add to your analysis and timing capabilities.

JAPANESE CANDLESTICKS AND YOU
Once you become accustomed to using candlestick charts, you will
find it disconcerting to be limited to a standard bar chart. Without
candlesticks, you will feel that you are not seeing the complete pic-
ture—that something is missing. Besides providing the quick and
easy pattern recognition, candlesticks have great visual appeal. The
data relationships almost jump off the page (or computer screen),
hardly the case with bar charts.
CANDLESTICK CHARTS VERSUS BAR CHARTS
Throughout this book, the assumed time period will be a single day
of trading. It should be understood that a bar or candle line can rep-
resent any trading period, not always just a day. However, daily

Introduction
analysis is probably the most common and will thus represent the
period of trading for this book. Additionally, the mention of inven-
tors, speculators, and traders will be used throughout with no at-
tempt to classify or define them.
Standard Bar Charts
The data required to produce a standard bar chart consists of the
open high, low, and close prices for the time period under study. A
bar chart consists of vertical lines representing the high to low range
in prices for that day. The high price refers to the highest price that
the issue traded during that day. Likewise, the low price refers to the
lowest price traded that day.
For years, the only other price element used in bar charting was
the close price. The close was represented on the high-low bar as a
small tick mark extending from the bar out to the right. Recently,
bar charting has incorporated the open price by another small tick
on the left side of the high-low bar. This stands true for almost all
stock charts and stock data vendors. Most futures and commodity
charts have always used the open price because it was more readily
available.
Most bar charts are displayed with a volume histogram at the bot-
tom. Charting services also offer a number of popular indicators
along with the bar chart. Technical analysis software vendors gave

the user a great deal of flexibility in displaying the bar charts. The
standard bar chart could be displayed with indicators, volume, open
interest, and a large assortment of other technical tools appropriate
for that software.
Candlestick Charts
Japanese candlestick charts do not require anything new or different
as far as data are concerned. Open, high, low, and close are all that is
needed to do candlestick charting. When this was first written, many

Introduction
data vendors did not have open prices on stocks. This problem can be
addressed by using the previous day’s close for today’s open price.
This, however, presents a somewhat controversial situation and is
thoroughly discussed in Chapter 6.
THE BODY (JITTAI)
The box that makes up the difference between the open and close is
called the real body of the candlestick. The height of the body is the
range between the day’s open price and the day’s close price. When
this body is black, it means that the closing price was lower than the
opening price. When the closing price is higher than the opening, the
body is white.
THE SHADOWS (KAGE)
The candlestick line may have small thin lines above and/or below
the body. These lines are called shadows and represent the high and
low prices reached during the trading day. The upper shadow (uwa-
kage) represents the high price and the lower shadow (shitakage) rep-
resents the lower price. Some Japanese traders refer to the upper

shadow as the hair and the lower shadow as the tail. It is these shad-
ows that give the appearance of a candle and its wick(s).
When drawing candlestick charts by hand, the Japanese use red
instead of white to represent the up days (close higher than open).
With the use of a computer, this is not feasible because red would be
printed as black on most printers and you could not tell the up days
from the down days. This also applies to photocopying.
If you compare Figures 1-4 and 1-5, you can see that the Japanese
candlestick chart really does not display anything different from the
standard bar chart. However, once you become accustomed to seeing

gain in popularity. For as long as it is used as intended, only a profit
of doom would suggest its demise.

CHAPTER TWO
Candlestick Lines
A day of trading in any stock or futures market is represented in tra-
ditional charts by a single line or price bar; Japanese candlestick
charting is no different, except that the information is so much more
easily interpreted.
There is much information provided in a single candle line. This
will help in understanding the psychology behind the many candle
patterns described in later chapters. There are a few candle patterns
that consist of only a single candlestick and also qualify as reversal
patterns. They will be covered thoroughly in the chapter on reversal
patterns.
Each type of candle line has a unique name and represents a possi-
ble trading scenario for that day. Some candle lines have Japanese
names and some have English names. Whenever possible, if the name
is in English, the Japanese name will also be given. The Japanese
name will be written in a format called Romanji.This is a method of
writing Japanese so that it can be pronounced properly by non-
Japanese-speaking people. Single candle lines are often referred to as
yin and yang lines. The terms yin and yang are Chinese, but have
been used by western analysis to account for polar terms, such as

in/out, on/off, up/down, and over/under. (the Japanese equivalents
are inn and yoh) Yin relates to bearish and yang relates to bullish.
There are 9 basic yin and yang lines in candlestick analysis. These can
be expanded to 15 different candle lines for a clearer explanation of
the various possibilities. It will be shown in later chapters how most
candle patterns can be reduced to single candle lines and maintain the
same bullish or bearish connotations.
LONG DAYS
Reference to long days is prevalent in most literature dealing with
Japanese candlesticks. Long describes the length of the candlestick
body, the difference between the open price and the close price, as
shown in Figure 2-1. A long day represents a large price movement
for the day. In other words, the open price and the close price were
considerably different.
How much must the open and close price differ to qualify as a long
day? Like most forms of analysis, context must be considered. Long
compared to what? It is best to consider only the most recent price
action to determine what is long and what is not. Japanese candle-
stick analysis is based solely upon the short-term price movement, so
the determination of long days should be also. Anywhere from the
previous 5 to 10 days should be more than adequate to produce the

Candlestick Lines
proper results. Other acceptable methods of determining long days
may also be used. These will be thoroughly discussed in the chapter
on pattern identification and the recognition.
SHORT DAYS
Short days, shown in Figure 2-2, may also be based on the same
methodology as long days, with comparable results. There are also
numerous days that do not fall into any of these two categories.
Figure 2-2
MARUBOZU
Marubozu means close-cropped or close-cut in Japanese. Other inter-
pretations refer to it as Bald or Shaven Head. In either case, the mean-
ing reflects the fact that there is no shadow extending from the body at
either the open or the close, or at both.
Black Marubozu
A Black Marubozu is a long black body with no shadows on either end
(Figure 2-3). This is considered an extremely weak line. It often be-
comes part of a bearish continuation or bullish reversal candle pattern,
especially if it occurs during a downtrend. This line, being black, shows
the weakness of the continuing downtrend. A long black line could be a
final sell off; this is why it is often the first day of many bullish reversal
patterns. It is also called a Major Yin or Marubozu of Yin.

Figure 2-3 Figure 2-4
White Marubozu
A White Marubozu (Figure 2-4) is a long white body with no shadow
on either end. This is an extremely strong line when considered on its
own merits. Opposite of the Black Marubozu, it often is the first part
of a bullish continuation or bearish reversal candle pattern. It is
sometimes called a Major Yang or Marubozu of Yang.
Closing Marubozu
A Closing Marubozu has no shadow extending from the close end of
the body, whether the body is white or black (Figure 2-5). If the body
is white, there is no upper shadow because the close is at the top of
the body. Likewise, if the body is black, there is no lower shadow
because the close is a the bottom of the body. The Black Closing
Marubozu (yasunebike) is considered a weak line and the White
Closing Marubozu is a strong line.
Opening Marubozu
The Opening Marubozu has no shadow extending from the open
price end of the body (Figure 2-6). If the body is white, there would
be no lower shadow, making it a strong bullish line. The Black Open-
ing Marubozu (yoritsuki takane), with no upper shadow, is a weak
and therefore bearish line. The Opening Marubozu is not as strong as
the Closing Marubozu.

SPINNING TOPS (KOMA)
Spinning Tops are candlestick lines that have small real bodies with
upper and lower shadows that are of greater length than the body’s
length (Figure 2-7). This represents indecision between the bulls and
the bears. The color of the body of a spinning top, along with the
actual size of the shadows, is not important. The small body relative
to the shadows is what makes the spinning top.
Figure 2-7
DOJI
When the body of a candle line is so small that the open and the clos-
ing prices are equal, they are called Doji (simultaneous or concur-
rent) lines. A Doji occurs when the open and close for that day are
the same, or certainly very close to being the same. The lengths of the
shadows can vary. The perfect Doji has the same opening and closing



==================================================

(cid:2) 16
Chapter Two
price, however, there is some interpretation that must be considered.
Requiring that the open and close be exactly equal would put too
much of a constraint on the data and there would not be many Doji.
If the difference between the open and close prices is within a few
ticks (minimum trading increments), it is more than satisfactory.
Determining a Doji day is similar to the method used for identifi-
cation of a long day; there are no rigid rules, only guidelines. Just like
the long day, it depends upon previous prices. If the previous days
were mostly Doji, then the Doji day is not important. If the Doji
occurs alone, it’s a signal that there is indecision and must not be
ignored. In almost all cases, a Doji by itself would not be significant
enough to forecast a change in the trend of prices, only a warning of
impending trend change. A Doji preceeded by a long white day in an
uptrend would be meaningful. This particular combination of days is
referred to as a bearish Doji Star (Chapter 3). An uptrend that, all of
a sudden, ceases to continue, would be caused for concern. A Doji
means that there is uncertainty and indecision.
According to Nison, Doji tend to be better at indicating a change
of trend when they occur at tops instead of at bottoms. This is related
to the fact that for an uptrend to continue, new buying must be pre-
sent. A downtrend can continue unabated. It is interesting to note
that the Doji also means “goof” or “bungle.”
Long-Legged Doji (juji)
The Long-Legged Doji has long upper and lower shadows in the mid-
dle of the day’s trading range, clearly reflecting the indecision of buy-
ers and sellers (Figure 2-8). Throughout the day the market moved
higher and then sharply lower, or vice versa. It then closed at or very
near the opening price. If the opening and closing are in the center of
the day’s range, the line is referred to as a Long-Legged Doji. Juji
means “cross.”

Gravestone Doji (tohba)
The Gravestone Doji (hakaishi), shown in Figure 2-9, is another form
of a Doji day. It develops when the Doji is at, or very near, the low of
the day.
The Gravestone Doji, like many of the Japanese terms, is based on
various analogies. In this case, the Gravestone Doji represents the
graves of those who have died in battle.
If the upper shadow is quite long, it means that the Gravestone
Doji is much more bearish. Prices open and trade higher all day
only to close where they opened, which is also the low price for the
day. This cannot possibly be interpreted as anything but a failure to
rally. The Gravestone Doji at a market top is a specific version of a
Shooting Star (Chapter 3). The only difference is the that the Shoot-
ing Star has a small body and the Gravestone Doji, being a Doji, has
no body. Some Japanese sources claim that the Gravestone Doji can
occur only on the ground, not in the air. This means it can be a bull-

ish indication on the ground or at a market low, not as good as a
bearish one. It certainly portrays a sense of indecision and a possi-
ble change in trend.
Dragonfly Doji (tonbo)
The Dragonfly Doji, or Tonbo (pronounced Tombo), occurs when
the open and close are at the high of the day (Figure 2-10). Like other
Doji days, this one normally appears at market turning points. You
will see in later chapters that this Doji is a special case of the Hang-
ing Man and Hammer lines. A Tonbo line with a very long lower
shadow (tail) (shitahigi) is also called a Takuri line. A Takuri line at
the end of a down trend is extremely bullish.
Four Price Doji
This rare Doji line occurs when all four price components are equal.
That is, the open, high, low, and close are the same (Figure 2-11).
This line could occur when a stock is very illiquid or the data source
did not have any prices other than the close. Futures traders should
not confuse this with a limit move. It is so rare that one should sus-
pect data errors. However, it does represent complete and total
uncertainty by traders in market direction.

STARS (HOSHI)
A Star appears whenever a small body gaps above or below the pre-
vious day’s long body (Figure 2-12). Ideally, the gap should encom-
pass the shadows, but this is not always necessary. A Star indicates
some uncertainty in the marketplace. Stars are part of many candle
patterns, primarily reversal patterns.

PAPER UMBRELLA (KARAKASA)
Many of these lines are also included in the next chapter on candle pat-
terns. Like the previously mentioned candle lines, the Umbrella lines
have strong reversal implications. There is strong similarity between the
Dragonfly Doji and this candle line. Two of the Umbrella lines are
called the Hammer and Hanging Man, depending upon their location
in the trend of the market.

CONCLUSION
The single candle lines are essential to Japanese candlestick analysis.
When they are used by themselves, and then in combinations with
other candle lines, a complete psyche of the market unfolds. Much of
the analysis of these lines and patterns is part of Sakata’s Method
(Chapter 5). However, this book will go beyond the Sakata Method
with additional patterns and methods. Some of these patterns are
new; some are variations of the originals.

CHAPTER THREE
Reversal Candle Patterns
A candle pattern can be a single candlestick line or multiple candle-
stick lines, seldom more than five or six. In Japanese literature, there
is occasional reference to patterns that use even more candlesticks,
but they will be included in the chapter on candle formations. The
order in which the candle patterns are discussed does not reflect their
importance or predictive ability. They are listed based upon the num-
ber of days or periods required for each pattern, with the one-day
patterns first. Generally, within each category the patterns are then
arranged based upon their frequency of occurrence.
Most of the candle patterns are inversely related. That is, for each
bullish pattern, there is a similar bearish pattern. The primary differ-
ence is their position relative to the short-term trend of the market.
The names of the bullish and bearish patterns may or may not be dif-
ferent. So that this chapter can serve as a reference, each pattern set
will be covered using the same basic format. Some patterns retain
their Japanese name while others have been given English interpreta-
tions. A few are identical in construction, but have different names.
Any differences will be dealt with in the individual discussions.
Three small vertical lines will precede the pattern drawing. These

REVERSAL VERSUS CONTINUATION PATTERNS
Reversal and continuation patterns have been separated into differ-
ent chapters. This chapter covers the reversal patterns and Chapter 4
covers the continuation patterns. This separation was done to add
convenience and simplify future reference. This is mentioned here
because the determination of bullish or bearish implications has to
do only with continued price action and not with previous action.
Previous price movement helps to determine only the pattern, not its
ability to foresee or anticipate future price movement. Whether a
reversal pattern or a continuation pattern, investment and trading
decisions still need to be made, even if it is the fact that you decide to
do nothing. Chapter 6 deals with this concept at length.
There is a normal expectancy to have a bullish pattern or situation
prior to a bearish counterpart. That tendency will continue here, ex-
cept when one counterpart tends to exhibit greater prevalence; then it
will be covered first. A number of new patterns are introduced with
this edition of this book. Many were created to serve as a comple-
mentary pattern to those that only had a bullish or bearish version,
but not both. In those cases, the original is always presented first.
CHAPTER FORMAT
Most of the candle patterns will be explained using a standard format
that should ensure easy reference at a later date. Some candle patterns
will not be covered as thoroughly as others because of their simplicity
or similarity to other patterns. Some patterns are only modified ver-

terns have a counterpart reflecting the other side of the market, some
of the scenarios will contain only one example. Additionally, some
repetition may seem to occur. This too is so that later reference will be
both easy and thorough. The usual format will be:

well need confirmation (Required). Those that seemed
to work well all of the time do not need confirmation

(No). A third category was derived because some of those
that were originally in the “worked well” category still
had a few statistics that were not good, therefore they
were placed in the Suggested category, meaning that con-
firmation is suggested. It is boldly stated later in this book
that all candle patterns should be confirmed with other
technical methods. A few good ones are mentioned herein.

Chapter Three
Figure 3-1 Figure 3-2
Commentary
The Hammer and Hanging Man are each made of single candlestick
lines (Figure 3-1 and 3-2). They have long lower shadows and small
real bodies that are at or very near the top of their daily trading
range. These were first introduced as paper umbrellas in Chapter 2.
They are also special versions of the Tonbo/Takuri lines.
The Hammer occurs in a downtrend and is so named because it is
hammering out a bottom. The Japanese word for Hammer (ton-
kachi) also means the ground or soil.
A Hanging Man occurs at the top of a trend or during an uptrend.
The name Hanging Man (kubitsuri) comes from the fact that this
candle line looks somewhat like a man hanging.
Another candle line similar to the Hammer is the Takuri (pro-
nounced taguri) line. This Japanese word equates with climbing a rope
or hauling up. The motion is not smooth and could be related to pulling
up an anchor with your hands: as you change hands; the upward move-
ment is interrupted momentarily. A Takuri line has a lower shadow at
least three times the length of the body, whereas the lower shadow of a
Hammer is a minimum of only twice the length of the body.
Rules of Recognition
1. The small real body is at the upper end of the trading range.
2. The color of the body is not important.

Reversal Candle Patterns
3. The long lower shadow should be much longer than the
length of the real body, usually two or three times.
4. There should be no upper shadow, or if there is, it should
be very small.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
Hammer
The market has been in a downtrend, so there is an air of bearishness.
The market opens and then sells off sharply. However, the sell-off is
abated and the market returns to, or near, its high for the day. The
failure of the market to continue the selling reduces the bearish sen-
timent, and most traders will be uneasy with any bearish positions
they might have. If the close is above the open, causing a white body,
the situation is even better for the bulls. Confirmation would be a
higher open with yet a still higher close on the next trading day.
Hanging Man
For the Hanging Man, the market is considered bullish because of the
uptrend. In order for the Hanging Man to appear, the price action for
the day must trade much lower than where it opened, then rally to
close near the high. This is what causes the long lower shadow, which
shows how the market just might begin a sell-off. If the market opens
lower the next day, there would be many participants with long posi-
tions that would want to look for an opportunity to sell. Steve Nison
claims that a confirmation that the Hanging Man is bearish might be
that the body is black and the next day opens lower.
Pattern Flexibility
Features that will enhance the signal of a Hammer or Hanging Man
pattern are an extra long lower shadow, no upper shadow, very small

Chapter Three
real body (almost Doji), the preceding sharp trend, and a body color
that reflects the opposite sentiment (previous trend). This trait, when
used on the Hammer, will change its name to a Takuri line. Takuri
lines are generally more bullish than Hammers.
The body color of the Hanging Man and the Hammer can add to
the significance of the pattern’s predictive ability. A Hanging Man
with a black body is more bearish than one with a white body. Like-
wise, a Hammer with a white body would be more bullish than one
with a black body.
As with most single candlestick patterns like the Hammer and the
Hanging Man, it is important to wait for confirmation. This confir-
mation may merely be the action on the open of the next day. Many
times, though, it is best to wait for a confirming close on the follow-
ing day. That is, if a Hammer is shown, the following day should
close even higher before bullish positions are taken.
The lower shadow should be, at a minimum, twice as long as the
body, but not more than three times. The upper shadow should be no
more than 5 to 10 percent of the high-low range. The low of the body
should be below the trend for a Hammer and above the trend for a
Hanging Man.
Pattern Breakdown
The Hammer and the Hanging Man patterns, being single candle
lines, cannot be reduced further. See Paper Umbrella in Chapter 2.
Related Patterns
The Hammer and Hanging Man are special cases of the Dragonfly
Doji discussed in Chapter 2. In most instances, the Dragonfly Doji
would be more bearish than the Hanging Man.

Reversal Candle Patterns
Commentary
Belt Hold lines are also opening marubozu lines (Chapter 2). Remem-
ber that the opening marubozu does not have a shadow extending
from the open end of the body. The bullish Belt Hold (Figure 3-4) is a
white opening marubozu that occurs in a downtrend. It opens on the
low of the day, rallies significantly against the previous trend, and
then closes near its high but not necessarily at its high. The bearish
Belt Hold (Figure 3-5) is a black opening marubozu that occurs in an
uptrend. Similarly, it opens on its high, trades against the trend of the
market, and then closes near its low. Longer bodies for Belt Hold lines
will offer more resistance to the trend that they are countering.
Belt Hold lines, like most of the single-day patterns lose their
importance if there are many of them in close proximity. The Japan-
ese name of yorikirimeans to push out. Steve Nison coined the name
of the Belt Hold.
Rules of Recognition
1. The Belt Hold line is identified by the lack of a shadow on
one end.
2. The bullish white Belt Hold opens on its low and has no
lower shadows.
3. The bearish black Belt Hold opens on its high and has no
upper shadows.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
The market is trending when a significant gap in the direction of
trend occurs on the open. From that point, the market never looks
back: All further price action that day is the opposite of the previous
trend. This causes much concern, and many positions will be covered
or sold, which will help accentuate the reversal.

Pattern Flexibility
Since this is a single candle pattern line, there is not much room for
any flexibility.
Related Patterns
The Belt Hold pattern is the same as the Opening Marubozu, dis-
cussed in Chapter 2. Like the Masubozu, the Belt Hold will form the
first day of many more advanced candle patterns.

Figure 3-7 Figure 3-8
Commentary
The Engulfing pattern consists of two real bodies of opposite color
(Figures 3-7 and 3-8). The second day’s body completely engulfs the
prior day’s body. The shadows are not considered in this pattern. It is
also called the Embracing (daki) line because it embraces the previ-
ous day’s line. When this occurs near a market top, or in an uptrend,
it indicates a shifting of the sentiment to selling. A yin Tsutsumi after
an uptrend is called the Final Daki line and is one of the Sakata tech-
niques discussed in a later chapter.
The first day of the Engulfing pattern has a small body and the sec-

==================================================

Reversal Candle Patterns
ond day has a long real body. Because the second day’s move is so
much more dramatic, it reflects a possible end to the previous trend.
If the bearish Engulfing pattern appears after a sustained move, it
increases the chance that most bulls are already long. In this case,
there may not be enough new money (bulls) to keep the market
uptrend intact.
An Engulfing pattern is similar to the traditional outside day. Just
like the Engulfing pattern, an outside day will close with prices
higher and lower than the previous range with the close in the direc-
tion of the new trend.
Rules of Recognition
1. A definite trend must be underway.
2. The second day’s body must be completely engulfed by the
prior day’s body. This does not mean, however, that either
the top or the bottom of the two bodies cannot be equal; it
just means the both tops and both bottoms cannot be
equal.
3. The first day’s color should reflect the trend: black for a
downtrend and white for an uptrend.
4. The second real body of the engulfing pattern should be the
opposite color of the first real body.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
Bearish Engulfing Pattern
An uptrend is in place when a small white body day occurs with not
much volume. The next day, prices open at new highs and then
quickly sell off. The sell-off is sustained by high volume and finally
closes below the open of the previous day. Emotionally, the uptrend

==================================================

Chapter Three
has been damaged. If the next (third) day’s prices remain lower, a
major reversal of the uptrend has occurred.
A similar, but opposite, scenario would exist for the bullish En-
gulfing pattern.
Pattern Flexibility
The second day of the Engulfing patterns engulfs more than the real
body; in other words, if the second day engulfs the shadows of the
first day, the success of the pattern will be much greater.
The color of the first day should reflect the trend of the market. In
an uptrend, the first day should be white, and vice versa. The color of
the second, or the engulfing day, should be the opposite of the fist day.
Engulfing means that no part of the first day’s real body is equal to
or outside of the second day’s real body. If the fist day’s real body was
engulfed by at least 30 percent, a much stronger pattern exists.
Pattern Breakdown
The bullish Engulfing pattern reduces to a Paper Umbrella or Ham-
mer, which reflects a market turning point (Figure 3-9). The bearish
Engulfing pattern reduces to a pattern similar to the Shooting Star or
possibly a Gravestone Doji, if the body is very small (Figure 3-10).

Reversal Candle Patterns
Both the bullish and bearish Engulfing patterns reduce to single lines
that fully support interpretation.
Related Patterns
The Engulfing pattern is also the first two days of the Three Outside
patterns. The bullish Engulfing pattern would become the Three
Outside Up pattern if the third day closed higher. Likewise, the bear-
ish Engulfing pattern would make up the Three Outside Down pat-
terns if the third day closed lower.
The Engulfing pattern is also a follow-through, or more advanced
stage, of the Piercing Line and the Dark Cloud Cover. Because of this,
the Engulfing pattern is considered more important.

Commentary
The Harami pattern is made up of the opposite arrangement of days
as the Engulfing pattern (Figure 3-12 and 3-13). Harami is a Japan-
ese word for pregnant or body within. You will find that in most
instances the real bodies in the Harami are opposite in color, also like
the Engulfing pattern.
You will probably note that the Harami is quite similar to the tra-
ditional inside day. The difference, of course, is that the traditional
inside day uses the highs and lows, whereas the Harami is concerned
only with the body (open and close). This requirement to use the open

and close prices instead of the high and low prices is common in
Japanese candlestick analysis and philosophy. The Harami requires
that the body of the scond day be completely engulfed by the body of
the first day.
Rules of Recognition
1. A long day is preceded by a reasonable trend.
2. The color of the long first day is not as important, but it is
best if it reflects the trend of the market.
3. A short day follows the long day, with its body completely
inside the body range of the long day. Just like the Engulf-
ing day, the tops or bottoms of the bodies can be equal, but
both tops and both bottoms cannot be equal.
4. The short day should be the opposite color of the long day.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
Bullish Harami
A downtrend has been in place for some time. A long black day with
average volume has occurred, which helps to perpetuate the bearish-
ness. The next day, prices open higher, which shocks many compla-
cent bears, and many shorts are quickly covered, causing the price to
rise further. The price rise is tempered by the usual late comers seeing
this as an opportunity to short the trend they missed the first time.
Volume on this day has exceeded the previous day, which suggests
strong short covering. A confirmation of the reversal on the third day
would provide the needed proof that the trend has reversed.
Bearish Harami
An uptrend is in place and is perpetuated with a long white day and
high volume. The next day, prices open lower and stay in a small

==================================================

Reversal Candle Patterns
range throughout the day, closing even lower, but still within the pre-
vious day’s body. In view of this sudden deterioration of trend,
traders should become concerned about the strength of this market,
especially if volume is light. It certainly appears that the trend is
about to change. Confirmation on the third day would be a lower
close.
Pattern Flexibility
The long day should reflect the trend. In an uptrend the long day
should be white and a downtrend should produce a black long day.
The amount of engulfing of the second day by the first day should be
significant. The long day should engulf the short day by at least 30
percent. Remember that long days are based upon the data preceding
them.
Pattern Breakdown
The bullish Harami reduces to a Paper Umbrella or a Hammer line,
which indicates a market turning point (Figure 3-14). The bearish
Harami reduces to a Shooting Star line, which also is a bearish line
(Figure 3-15). Both the bullish and the bearish Harami are supported
by their single-line breakdowns.

Commentary
The Harami pattern consists of a long body followed by a smaller
body. It is the relative size of these two bodies that make the Harami
important. Remember that Doji days, where the open and close price
are equal, represent days of indecision. Therefore, small body days
that occur after longer body days can also represent a day of indeci-
sion. The more the indecision and uncertainty, the more likelihood of
a trend change. When the body of the second day becomes a Doji, the
pattern is referred to as a Harami Cross (Figure 3-17 and 3-18), with

Reversal Candle Patterns
the cross being the Doji. The Harami Cross is a better reversal pattern
than the regular Harami.
Rules of Recognition
1. A long day occurs within a trending market.
2. The second day is a Doji (open and close are equal).
3. The second-day Doji is within the range of the previous long
day.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
The psychology behind the Harami Cross starts out the same as that for
the basic Harami pattern. A trend has been in place when, all of a sud-
den, the market gyrates throughout a day without exceeding the body
range of the previous day. What’s worse, the market closes at the same
price as it opened. Volume of this Doji day also drys up, reflecting the
complete lack of decision of traders. A significant reversal of trend has
occurred.
Pattern Flexibility
The color of the long day should reflect the trend. The Doji can have an
open and a close price that are within 2 to 3 percent of each other if,
and only if, there are not many Doji days in the preceding data.
Pattern Breakdown
The bullish and bearish Harami Crosses reduce to single lines that sup-
port their interpretation in most instances (Figure 3-19 and 3-20). The
body of the single-day reduction can be considerably longer than what
is allowed for a Paper Umbrella or Hammer line. The fact that the
breakdown is not contrary to the patter is supportive.

Inverted Hammer
The Inverted Hammer is a bottom reversal line (Figure 3-22). Similar
to its cousin the Hammer, it occurs in a downtrend and represents a
possible reversal of trend. Common with most single- and double-
candlestick patterns, it is important to wait for verification, in this
case bullish verification. This could be in a form of the next day’s
opening above the Inverted Hammer’s body. Because the closing
price is near the low for the day and the market actually traded much

Reversal Candle Patterns
higher, verification is most important. Additionally, there is little ref-
erence to this pattern in Japanese literature.
Shooting Star
The Shooting Star (Figure 3-23) is a single-line pattern that indicates
an end to the upward move. It is not a major reversal signal. The
Shooting Star line looks exactly the same as the Inverted Hammer.
The difference, of course, is that the Shooting Star occurs at market
tops. A rally attempt was completely aborted when the close
occurred near the low of the day. The body of the Shooting Star does
gap above the previous day’s body. This fact actually means that the
Shooting Star could be referred to as a two-line pattern because the
previous day’s body must be considered.
Rules of Recognition
Inverted Hammer
1. A small real body is formed near the lower part of the price
range.
2. No gap down is required, as long as the pattern falls after a
downtrend.
3. The upper shadow is usually no more than two times as
long as the body.
4. The lower shadow is virtually nonexistent.
Shooting Star
1. Prices gap open after an uptrend.
2. A small real body is formed near the lower part of the price
range.
3. The upper shadow is at least three times as long as the body.
4. The lower shadow is virtually nonexistent.

Chapter Three
Scenario and Psychology behind the Pattern
Inverted Hammer
A downtrend had been in place when the market opens with a down
gap. A rally throughout the day fails to hold and the market closes
near its low. Similar to the scenario of the Hammer and the Hanging
Man, the opening of the following day is crucial to the success or fail-
ure of this pattern to call a reversal of trend. If the next day opens
above the Inverted Hammer’s body, a potential trend reversal will
cause shorts to be covered, which would also perpetuate the rally.
Similarly, an Inverted Hammer could easily become the middle day of
a more bullish Morning Star pattern.
Shooting Star
During an uptrend, the market gaps open, rallies to a new high, and
then closes near its low. This action, following a gap up, can only be
considered as bearish. Certainly, it would cause some concern to any
bulls who have profits.
Pattern Flexibility
Single-day candlesticks allow little flexibility. The length of the
shadow will help in determining its strength. The upper shadow
should be at least twice the length of the body. There should be no
lower shadow, or at least not more than 5 to 10 percent of the high-
low range. Like most situations, the color of the body can help, if it
reflects the sentiment of the pattern.
Pattern Breakdown
Even though the Inverted Hammer and the Shooting Star are consid-
ered as single-day patterns, the previous day must be used to add to

the patterns’ successfulness. The Inverted Hammer pattern reduces to
a long black candle line, which is always viewed as a bearish indica-
tion when considered alone (Figure 3-24). The Shooting Star pattern
reduces to a long white candle line, which almost always is consid-
ered a bullish line (Figure 3-25). Both of these patterns are in direct
conflict with their breakdowns. This indicates that further confirma-
tion should always be required before acting on them.
Related Patterns
As the Hammer and Hanging Man were related to the Dragonfly
Doji, the Shooting Start and Inverted Hammer are cousins to the
Gravestone Doji.

Commentary
The Piercing Line pattern, shown in Figure 3-27, is essentially the
opposite of the Dark Cloud Cover (see next pattern). This pattern
occurs in a downtrending market and is a two-line or two-day pat-
tern. The first day is black, which supports the downtrend and the
second day is a long white day, which opens at a new low and then
closes above the midpoint of the preceding black day. Kirikomi
means a cutback or a switchback.

==================================================

(cid:2) 56
Chapter Three
Rules of Recognition
1. The first day is a long black body continuing the down-
trend.
2. The second day is a white body which opens below the low
of the previous day (that’s low, not close).
3. the second day closes within but above the midpoint of the
previous day’s body.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
A long black body forms in a downtrend, which maintains the bear-
ishness. A gap to the downside in the next day’s open further perpet-
uates the bearishness. However, the market rallies all day and closes
much higher. In fact the close is above the midpoint of the body of the
long black day. This action causes concern to the bears and a poten-
tial bottom has been made. Candlestick charting shows this action
quite well, where standard bar charting would hardly discern it.
Pattern Flexibility
The white real body should close more than halfway into the prior
black candlestick’s body, If it didn’t, you probably should wait for
more bullish confirmation. There is no flexibility to this rule with the
Piercing pattern. The Piercing pattern’s white candlestick must rise
more than halfway into the black candlestick’s body. There are three
additional candle patterns called On Neck Line, In Neck Line, and
Thrusting Line (covered in Chapter 4), which make the definition of
the Piercing Line so stringent. These three patterns are similar to the
Piercing Line but are classified as bearish continuation patterns
because the second day doesn’t rally nearly as much.
The more penetration into the prior day’s black body, the more
likely it will be a successful reversal pattern. Remember that if it

closes above the body of the previous day, it is not a Piercing pattern,
but a bullish Engulfing day.
Both days of the Piercing pattern should be long days. The second
day must close above the midpoint and below the open of the first
day, with no exceptions.
Pattern Breakdown
The Piercing Line pattern reduces to a Paper Umbrella or Hammer
line, which is indicative of a market reversal or turning point (Figure
3-28). The single candle line reduction fully supports the bullishness
of the Piercing Line.
Related Patterns
Three patterns begin in the same way as the Piercing Line. However,
they do not quite give the reversal signal that the Piercing Line does
and are considered continuation patterns. These are the On Neck
Line, In Neck Line, and Thrusting Line (Chapter 4). The bullish
Engulfing pattern is also an extension, or more mature situation, of
the Piercing Line.

Reversal Candle Patterns
Figure 3-30
Commentary
The Dark Cloud Cover (Figure 3-30) is a bearish reversal pattern and
the counterpart of the Piercing pattern (Figure 3-27). Because this
pattern only occurs in an uptrend, the first day is a long white day.
This is one of the few times that the high or low is used in candle pat-
tern definitions. Trading lower throughout the day results in the close
being below the midpoint of the long white day.
This reversal pattern, like the opposite Piercing Line, has a marked
effect on the attitude of traders because of the higher open followed
by the much lower close. There are no exceptions to this pattern.
Kabuse means to get covered or to hang over.
Rules of Recognition
1. The first day is a long white body, which is continuing the
uptrend.
2. The second day is a black body day with the open above
the previous day’s high (that’s the high, not the close).
3. The second (black) day closes within and below the mid-

Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
The market is in an uptrend. Typical in an uptrend, a long white can-
dlestick is formed. The next day the market gaps higher on the open-
ing, however, that is all that is remaining to the uptrend. The market
drops to close well into the body of the white day, in fact, below its
midpoint. People who were bullish would certainly have to rethink
their strategy with this type of action. Like the Piercing Line, a sig-
nificant reversal of trend has occurred.
Pattern Flexibility
The more penetration of the black body’s close into the prior white
body, the greater the chance for a top reversal. The first day should
be a long day, with the second day opening significantly higher. This
merely accentuates the reversal of sentiments in the market.
Pattern Breakdown
The Dark Cloud Cover pattern reduces to a Shooting Star line, which
supports the bearishness of the pattern (Figure 3-31). If the second
day’s black body closes deeply into the first day, the breakdown would
be a Gravestone Doji, which also fully supports the bearishness.

The Dark Cloud Cover is also the beginning of a bearish Engulfing
pattern. Because of this, it would make the bearish Engulfing pattern
a more bearish reversal signal than the Dark Cloud Cover.

Reversal Candle Patterns
Commentary
A Doji Star is a warning that a trend is about to change. It is a long
real body, which should reflect the previous trend. A downtrend
should produce a black body, an uptrend, a white body (Figures 3-33
and 3-34). The next day, prices gap in the direction of the trend, then
close at the opening. This deterioration of the previous trend is
immediate cause for concern. The clear message of the Doji Star is an
excellent example of the value of the candlestick method of charting.
If you were using close only or standard bar charts, the deterioration
of the trend would not quite yet be apparent. Candlesticks, however,
show that the trend is abating because of the gap in real bodies by the
Doji Star.
Rules of Recognition
1. The first day is a long day.
2. The second day gaps in the direction of the previous
trend.
3. The second day is a Doji.
4. The shadows on the Doji day should not be excessively
long, especially in the bullish case.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
Considering the bearish Doji Star, the market is in an uptrend and is
further confirmed by a strong white day. The next day gaps even
higher, trades in a small range, and then closes at or near its open.
This will erode almost all confidence from the previous rally. Many
positions have been changed, which caused the Doji in the first place.
The next day’s open, if lower, would set the stage for a reversal of
trend.

==================================================

(cid:2) 64
Chapter Three
Pattern Flexibility
If the gap can also contain the shadows, the significance of the trend
change is greater. The first day should also reflect the trend with its
body color.
Pattern Breakdown
The bullish Doji Star reduces to a long black candlestick, which does
not support the bullishness of the pattern (Figure 3-35). The bearish
Doji Star reduces to a long white candle line, which puts it in direct
conflict with the pattern (Figure 3-36). These breakdown conflicts
should not be ignored.
Related Patterns
The Doji Star is the first two days of either the Morning Doji Star or
Evening Doji Star.

Commentary
Meeting Lines are formed when opposite-colored candlesticks have
the same closing price. Some literature refers to Meeting Lines as
Counterattack Lines. Deaisen means lines that meet and gyaku-
shusen means counteroffensive lines.

Bullish Meeting Line
This pattern normally occurs during a decline. The first day of this pat-
tern is a long black candlestick (Figure 3-38). The next day opens
sharply lower and puts the downtrend into a compromising position.
The bullish Meeting Line is somewhat similar in concept to the bullish
Piercing Line, with the difference being the amount the second day
rebounds. The Meeting Line only rises up to the first day’s close while
the Piercing Line’s second day goes above the midpoint of the first day’s
body. The bullish Meeting Line is not as significant as the Piercing Line.
Also, do not confuse this with the On Neck Line covered in Chapter 4.
Bearish Meeting Line
An almost opposite relationship exists for the bearish Meeting Line rel-
ative to the Dark Cloud Cover. The bearish Meeting Line (Figure 3-39)
opens at a new high and then closes at the same close of the previous day,
while the Dark Cloud cover drops to below the midpoint.

Chapter Three
Rules of Recognition
1. The lines have bodies that extend the current trend.
2. The first body’s color always reflects the trend: black for
downtrend and white for uptrend.
3. The second body is the opposite color.
4. The close of each day is the same.
5. Both days should be long days.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
Bullish Meeting Line
The market has been in a downtrend when a long black day forms,
which further perpetuates the trend. The next day opens with a gap
down, then rallies throughout the day to close at the same close as
the previous day. This fact shows how previous price benchmarks are
used by traders: the odds are very good that a reversal has taken
place. If the third day opens higher, confirmation has been given.
Pattern Flexibility
The Meeting Line pattern should consist of two long lines. However,
many times the second day is not nearly as long as the first day. This
doesn’t seem to affect the pattern’s ability; confirmation is still sug-
gested. It is also best if each day is a Closing Marubozu.
Pattern Breakdown
The Meeting Lines break down into single candle lines that offer no
support for their case (Figure 3-40 and 3-41). The single lines are
similar to the first line in the pattern, with a shadow that extends in
the direction of the second day. Again, the breakdown neither con-
firms the pattern nor indicates lack of support.

Somewhat opposite in appearance are the Separating Lines, which
are continuation patterns. One can also see the potential for these

Reversal Candle Patterns
Figure 3-43
Commentary
The Homing Pigeon closely resembles the Harami pattern, except
that both of its bodies are black rather than opposite in color.
Rules of Recognition
1. A long black body occurs in a downtrend.
2. A short black body is completely inside the previous day’s
body.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
The market is in a downtrend, evidenced by a long black day. The
next day, prices open higher, trade completely within the prior day’s
body, and then close slightly lower. Depending upon the severity of
the previous trend, this shows a deterioration and offers an opportu-
nity to get out of the market.
Pattern Flexibility
Two-day patterns do not offer much flexibility.

Chapter Three
Rules of Recognition
1. A long white body develops in an uptrend.
2. Both real bodies must be white.
3. The second day’s body is completely engulfed by the first
day’s body.
4. Both days’ bodies must be long.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
The Descending Hawk pattern starts with a long white day. The mid-
point of the range of the first day is above a 10-period moving aver-
age. This means that an uptrend has been in place. The long white
day adds to the bullishness already present. The next day, prices open
lower. Trading is somewhat confined this second day, and prices
finally close up near their highs for the day. You would want to see
prices open lower the next day and then close below the first day’s
open as confirmation for this pattern.
Pattern Flexibility
Both days of the Descending Hawk pattern must have long bodies.
The body of a candlestick is the part between the open and the close.
A long body, in this instance, is a body that occupies more than 50%
of the high-low range. Do not confuse a long body requirement with
a long day requirement. By definition, both days of the Descending
Hawk pattern will have relatively short shadows.

support and will cause much concern from any apathetic bears who
ignore it. Apathetic bears are short the market, and quite comfort-
able with their short positions. If they ignore the Matching Low as a
possible trend reversal, it will cause them much concern.
An interesting concept is presented with this pattern. The psychol-
ogy of the market is not necessarily with the action behind the daily
trading, but with the fact that the trading closes at the same price on
both days.
Pattern Flexibility
The length of the bodies of the two days may be either long or short
without affecting the meaning of the pattern.
Pattern Breakdown
The Matching Low pattern reduces to a long black line, which
is usually bearish (Figure 3-50). Confirmation would be highly
recommended.
Figure 3-50
Related Patterns
The Matching Low closely resembles the Homing Pigeon pattern,
but because the closes are equal, the second day does not quite fit the
definition of being engulfed.

The Matching High pattern is a two-day bearish reversal pattern. It
was created to provide a complementary pattern for the Matching
Low pattern.
Rules of Recognition
1. The first day is a long white day that occurs in an
uptrend.
2. The second day has the same closing price as the first day.
3. Both days have little or no upper shadow.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
The Matching High pattern starts with a long white day. The mid-

age. This means that an uptrend has been in place. The long white
day adds to the bullishness already present.

Reversal Candle Patterns
The next day has the same closing price as the first day. Both days
have little or no upper shadow. The dominant feature of this pattern
is two white days with the same closing price. As such, there has not
been any consideration to giving the second day any length of day or
length of body requirements (apart from the little or no upper
shadow requirement). This pattern indicates that a top has possibly
been formed. You would want to see prices open lower the next day
and then close below the first day’s open as confirmation for this
pattern.
Pattern Flexibility
The first day of the Matching High pattern must have a long body.
The body of a candlestick is the part between the open and the close.
A long body is a body that occupies more than 50% of the high-low
range.
Note: One should consider the two days to have the same closing
price as long as the second day’s closing price is within one one-
thousandth (1⁄ ) of the first day’s closing price. So, for example, if
1000
the first day closes at 20, the second day is permitted to close between
19.98 and 20.02.
Pattern Breakdown
The Matching High pattern breaks down into a long white body with
a lower shadow and therefore confirmation is required.
Related Patterns
The Matching High pattern can resemble the Descending Hawk
pattern.

Figure 3-55 Figure 3-56
Commentary
The Kicking pattern is similar to the Separating Lines pattern,
except that instead of the open prices being equal, a gap occurs. The
bullish Kicking pattern is a Black Marubozu followed by a White
Marubozu (Figure 3-55). The bearish Kicking pattern is a White
Marubozu followed by a Black Marubozu (Figure 3-56). Some
Japanese theory says that future movement will be in the direction of
the longer side of the two candles, regardless of the price trend. The
market direction is not as important with this pattern as it is with
most other candle patterns.
Rules of Recognition
1. A Marubozu of one color is followed by a Marubozu of the
opposite color.
2. A gap must occur between the two lines.

Reversal Candle Patterns
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
The market has been in a trend when prices gap the next day. The
prices never enter into the previous day’s range and then close with
another gap.
Pattern Flexibility
This allows no flexibility. If the gap does not exist, a Separating Lines
(continuation) pattern will be formed.
Pattern Breakdown
The bullish Kicking pattern reduces to a long white candle line, which
usually is bullish (Figure 3-57). The bearish Kicking pattern reduces
to a long black candle line, which is usually bearish (Figure 3-58).

Commentary
The One White Soldier pattern is a two-day bullish reversal pattern.
The One White Soldier pattern is based on the Tasuki candlestick
line. A Tasuki line occurs when prices open higher than the previous
day’s close and then close higher than the previous day’s high. Tasuki
is a sash for holding up one’s sleeves.
Rules of Recognition
1. The One White Soldier pattern starts with a long black day.
2. The second day is a long white day that opens at or above
the previous day’s close and then closes near the highs of
the day, ending above the high of the previous day.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
The One White Soldier pattern starts with a long black day. The mid-
point of the range of the first day is below a 10-period moving aver-

age. This means that a downtrend has been in place. The long black
day adds to the bearishness already present.
The second day is a long white day that opens at or above the pre-
vious day’s close and then closes near the highs of the day, ending
above the high of the previous day.
Emotionally, the downtrend has been damaged. If the following
day’s prices continue higher, a major reversal of the downtrend has
occurred.
Pattern Flexibility
Both days are long days. A long day occurs when the high-low
range is either (1) greater than 1.5% of the midpoint value or (2)
greater than .75 times the average of the prior five days’ high-low
ranges, depending on the method used to determine the length of a
day. The high-low range is the difference between a day’s high and
low. The midpoint value is the point halfway between the day’s high
and low.
Both days must have long bodies as well. The body of a candle-
stick is the part between the open and the close. A long body is a
body that occupies more than 50% of the high-low range.
Pattern Breakdown
The One White Soldier breaks down to a small white body with a
long lower shadow (Figure 3-61B). Confirmation is required.
Related Patterns
The One White Soldier pattern is similar to the Piercing Line, bullish
Engulfing, and bullish Harami patterns.

Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
The One Black Crow pattern starts with a long white day. The mid-
point of the range of the first day is above a 10-period moving aver-
age. This means that an uptrend has been in place. The long white
day adds to the bullishness already present.

sal of the uptrend has occurred.

Both days are long days. A long day occurs when the high-low range

Commentary
Morning Star
The Morning Star is a bullish reversal pattern. Its name indicates
that it foresees higher prices. It is made of a long black body fol-
lowed by a small body that gaps lower (Figure 3-66). The third day
is a white body that moves into the first day’s black body. An ideal
Morning Star would have a gap before and after the middle (star)
day’s body.
Evening Star
The bearish counterpart of the Morning Star is the Evening Star.
Because the Evening Star is a bearish pattern, it appears after, or dur-
ing, an uptrend. The first day is a long white body followed by a star
(Figure 3-67). Remember that a star’s body gaps away from the pre-
vious day’s body. The star’s smaller body is the first sign of indeci-
sion. The third day gaps down and closes even lower, completing this
pattern. Like the Morning Star, the Evening Star should have a gap
between the first and second bodies and then another gap between
the second and third bodies. Some literature does not refer to the sec-
ond gap.

Chapter Three
Rules of Recognition
1. The first day is always the color that was established by the
ensuing trend. That is, an uptrend will yield a long white
day for the first day of the Evening Star and a downtrend
will yield a black first day of the Morning Star.
2. The second day, the star, is always gapped from the body of
the first day. Its color is not important.
3. The third day is always the opposite color of the first day.
4. The first day, and most likely the third day, are considered
long days.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
Morning Star
A downtrend has been in place, which is assisted by a long black can-
dlestick. There is little doubt about the downtrend continuing with
this type of action. The next day prices gap lower on the open. This
small body shows the beginning of indecision. The next day prices
gap higher on the open and then close much higher. A significant
reversal of trend has occurred.
Evening Star
The scenario of the Evening Star is the exact opposite of the Morning
Star.
Pattern Flexibility
Ideally there is one gap between the bodies of the first candlestick
and the star, and a second gap between the bodies of the star and the
third candlestick. Some flexibility is possible in the gap between the
star and the third day.

Reversal Candle Patterns
If the third candlestick closes deeply into the first candlestick’s real
body, a much stronger move should ensue, especially if heavy volume
occurs on the third day. Some literature likes to see the third day
close more than halfway into the body of the first day.
Pattern Breakdown
The Morning Star reduces to a Paper Umbrella or Hammer line,
which fully supports the Morning Star’s bullish indication (Figure 3-
68). The Evening Star pattern reduces to a Shooting Star line, which
is also a bearish line and in full support (Figure 3-69).

Chapter Three
Figure 3-71 Figure 3-72
Commentary
Remember from the discussion of the Doji Star that a possible rever-
sal of trend is occurring because of the indecision associated with the
Doji. Doji Stars are warnings that the prior trend is probably going
to at least change. The day after the Doji should confirm the impend-
ing trend reversal. The Morning and Evening Doji star patterns do
exactly this.
Morning Doji Star
A downtrending market is in place with a long black candlestick,
which is followed by a Doji Star. Just like the regular Morning Star,
confirmation on the third day fully supports the reversal of trend.
This type of Morning Star, the Morning Doji Star (Figure 3-71), can
represent a significant reversal. It is therefore considered more signif-
icant than the regular Morning Star pattern.
Evening Doji Star
A Doji Star in an uptrend followed by a long black body that closed
well into the first day’s white body would confirm a top reversal (Fig-
ure 3-72). The regular Evening Star pattern has a small body as its

Reversal Candle Patterns
star, whereas the Evening Doji Star has a Doji as its star. The Evening
Doji Star is more important because of this Doji. The Evening Doji
has also been referred to as the Southern Cross.
Rules of Recognition
1. Like many reversal patterns, the first day’s color should rep-
resent the trend of the market.
2. The second day must be a Doji Star (a Doji that gaps).
3. The third day is the opposite color of the first day.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
The psychology behind these patterns is similar to those of the regu-
lar Morning and Evening Star patterns, except that the Doji Star is
more of a shock to the previous trend and, therefore, more signifi-
cant.
Pattern Flexibility
Flexibility may occur in the amount of penetration into the first day’s
body by the third day. If penetration is greater than 50%, this pattern
has a better chance to be successful.
Pattern Breakdown
The Morning Doji Star reduces to a Hammer pattern (Figure 3-73)
and on occasion will reduce to a Dragonfly Doji line. The Evening
Doji Star reduces to a Shooting Star line (Figure 3-74) and occasion-
ally to a Gravestone Doji line. The closer the breakdown is to the sin-
gle Doji lines, the greater the support for the pattern, because the
third day closes further into the body of the first day.

Commentary
Another major reversal pattern that is similar in format to the family
of Morning and Evening Star patterns is the Abandoned Baby pat-
tern. This pattern is almost exactly the same as the Morning and
Evening Doji Star pattern with one important exception. Here, the
shadows on the Doji must also gap below the shadows of the first
and third days for the Abandoned baby bottom (Figure 3-76). The
opposite is true for the Abandoned Baby top (Figure 3-77), the Doji
must completely (including shadows) gap above the surrounding
days. The Abandoned Baby is quite rare.

Reversal Candle Patterns
Rules of Recognition
1. The first day should reflect the prior trend.
2. The second day is a Doji whose shadow gaps above or
below the previous day’s upper or lower shadow.
3. The third day is the opposite color of the first day.
4. The third day gaps in the opposite direction with no shad-
ows overlapping.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
Like most of the three-day star patterns, the scenarios are similar.
The primary difference is that the star (second day) can reflect greater
deterioration in the prior trend, depending on whether it gaps, is
Doji, and so on.
Pattern Flexibility
Because of the specific parameters used to define this pattern, there is
not much room for flexibility. This is a special case of the Morning
and Evening Doji Stars, in which the second day is similar to a tradi-
tional island reversal day.
Pattern Breakdown
The breakdown of the Abandoned Baby pattern, both bullish and
bearish, are extensions of the Morning and Evening Doji Stars (Fig-
ure 3-78 and 3-79). The bullishness or bearishness is further ampli-
fied because the long shadow is usually longer than in the previous
cases. As before, the more that the third day closes into the first day’s
body, the closer these breakdowns are to the Dragonfly and Grave-
stone Doji lines.

This is a special case of the Doji Star in that the Doji day gaps from
the previous day. This gap includes all shadows, not just the body.

Commentary
The Tri Star pattern (Figures 3-81 and 3-82) was developed by Steve
Nison. It is made up of three Doji days with the middle Doji day
being a star. This pattern is extremely rare, but when it occurs should
not be ignored.
Rules of Recognition
1. All three days are Doji.
2. The second day gaps above or below the first and third day.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
The market has probably been in an uptrend or downtrend for a
long time. With the trend starting to show weakness, bodies proba-

bly are becoming smaller. The first Doji would cause considerable
concern. The second Doji would indicate that there was no direc-
tion left in the market. And finally, the third Doji would put the
final nail in the coffin of the trend. Because this indicates entirely
too much indecision, everyone with any conviction would be re-
versing positions.
Pattern Flexibility
Be careful with this one. Because the Tri Star is so rare, you should
probably be suspect of the data used in its calculation. If the middle
Doji gap includes the shadows, it would be even more significant.
Pattern Breakdown
The Tri Star patterns break down into Spinning Tops, which are
indicative of the market indecision (Figure 3-83 and 3-84). This is
somewhat of a conflict with the Tri Star pattern and supports the
notion that because this pattern is so rare, it should be viewed with
some skepticism.

Based on the previous discussions, you can see what a rare pattern
this is.

Commentary
This pattern only occurs in an uptrend. As with most bearish rever-
sal patterns, it begins with a white body candlestick. The gap referred
to in the name of this pattern is the gap between, not only the first
and second days, but also the first and third days. The second and
third days are black, which is where the two crows originate.

Chapter Three
The third day (second black day) should open higher and then
close lower than the close of the second day. The third day, even
though closing lower than the second day, still is gapped above the
first day. Simply said, the second black day engulfs the first black day.
Rules of Recognition
1. An uptrend continues with a long white day.
2. An upward gapping black day is formed after the white
day.
3. A second black day opens above the first black day and
closes below the body of the first black day. Its body
engulfs the first black day.
4. The close of the second black day is still above the close of
the long white day.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
Like the beginning of most bearish reversal patterns, a white body
day occurs in an uptrend. The next day opens with a higher gap, fails
to rally, and closes lower, forming a black day. This is not too worri-
some because it still did not get lower than the first day’s close. On
the third day prices again gap to a higher open and then drop to close
lower than the previous day’s close. This closing price, however, is
still above the close of the white first day. The bullishness is bound to
subside. How can you have two successively lower closes and still be
a raging bull?
Pattern Flexibility
The Upside Gap Two Crows pattern is fairly rigid. If the third day
(second black day) were to close into the white day’s body, the pat-

Reversal Candle Patterns
tern would become a Two Crows pattern (discussed later in this
chapter).
Pattern Breakdown
The Upside Gap Two Crows pattern reduces to a candle line whose
white body is slightly longer than the first day’s white body and has
a long upper shadow (Figure 3-87). The fact that this is not exactly a
bearish candle line suggests that some further confirmation is
required before acting on this pattern.
Figure 3-87
Related Patterns
A failure of the third day’s black body to open slightly below the sec-
ond day’s open and remain above the first day’s body could lead to
this pattern’s becoming a Mat Hold continuation pattern. The Mat
Hold is a bullish continuation pattern discussed in the next chapter.
Also, the first two days of this pattern could become an Evening Star,
depending upon what happens the third day.

Reversal Candle Patterns
Figure 3-89
Commentary
The Downside Gap Two Rabbits pattern is a three-day bullish rever-
sal pattern. The downside gap refers to the gap between the white
real body of the second day and the black real body of the first day.
The last two days’ white candlesticks represent two white rabbits
ready to jump up out of their burrow.
Note: The Downside Gap Two Rabbits pattern is rare.
Rules of Recognition
1. The pattern begins with a long black day that occurs during
a downtrend.
2. The second day is a downward gapping white day.

Chapter Three
3. The third day is also a white day that opens below the bot-
tom and then closes above the top of the previous white day.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
The Downside Gap Two Rabbits pattern starts with a long black day.
The midpoint of the range of the first day is below a 10-period mov-
ing average. This means that a downtrend has been in place. The long
black day adds to the bearishness already present.
The next day opens lower with a gap. Prices rise, however, and the
day forms a white candlestick. The bears are not shaken by this day
because the close of the white day is still below the close of the first
day. Although the third day opens way down, it rallies throughout
the day and closes above the previous day’s close. The strength and
continuation of the downtrend has been put into question by these
two consecutive white days.
Pattern Flexibility
The body of the third day must completely engulf the second day’s
body. Additionally, the third day’s high-low range completely engulfs
the second day’s high-low range.
All three days must also have long bodies. The body of a candle-
stick is the part between the open and the close. A long body is a
body that occupies more than 50% of the high-low range. Although
the body of the second day may be relatively small, it is still a long
body in relation to its high-low range.
For this pattern, it is strongly recommended that the third day
close below the close of the first day. This leaves the gap created by
the first and second days still unfilled.

Note: This also requires that the gap between the real bodies of the
first and second days be greater than 10% of the high-low range of
the first day.
Pattern Breakdown
The Downside Gap Two Rabbits pattern reduces to a long black can-
dle line and is not representative of this pattern’s reversal status. Con-
firmation is definitely required.

Reversal Candle Patterns
Figure 3-92
Commentary
As demonstrated by Figure 3-92, the Unique Three River Bottom is a
pattern somewhat like the Morning Star. The trend is down and a
long black real body is formed. The next day opens higher, trades at
a new low, then closes near the high, producing a small black body.
The third day opens lower, but not lower than the low that was made
on the second day. A small white body is formed on the third day,
which closes below the close of the second day.
Note: The Unique Three River Bottom is extremely rare.
Rules of Recognition
1. The first day is a long black day.
2. The second day is a Harami day, but the body is also black.
3. The second day has a lower shadow that sets a new low.
4. The third day is a short white day that is below the middle
day.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
A falling market produces a long black day. The next day opens
higher, but the bearish strength causes a new low to be set. A sub-

Chapter Three
stantial rally ensues in which the strength of the bears is in question.
This indecision and lack of stability is enforced when the third day
opens lower. Stability arrives with a small white body on the third
day. If, on the fourth day, price rises to new highs, a reversal of trend
has been confirmed.
Pattern Flexibility
Because this is such an unusual and precise pattern, there is not much
flexibility. If the lower shadow on the second day were quite long, the
greater potential for reversal would be more likely. In some litera-
ture, the second day resembles a Hammer line. Like many reversal
patterns, if volume supports the reversal, the success is likely to be
greater.
Pattern Breakdown
The Unique Three River Bottom pattern reduces to a single line that
most likely is a Hammer line (Figure 3-93). The lower shadow must
be at least twice as long as the body to be a Hammer, which in this
case, is quite possible because of the long lower shadow on the sec-
ond day. The Hammer fully supports the bullishness of the Unique
Three River Bottom pattern.

then trades down to close near the low of the day, thereby
producing a small white body with a long upper shadow.
3. The third day opens higher, but not higher than the high
that was made on the second day.
4. A relatively small black body is formed on the third day,
which closes above the close of the second day.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
The Unique Three Mountain Top pattern starts with a long white
day. The midpoint of the range of the first day is above a 10-period
moving average. This means that an uptrend has been in place. The
long white day adds to the bullishness already present.
The next day opens lower, but the bullish strength causes a new
high to be made. A substantial decline then ensues in which the
strength of the bulls is called into question. This indecision and lack
of stability is enforced when the third day opens higher. Stability
arrives with a small black body on the third day. If, on the fourth
day, prices drop to new lows, a reversal of the trend has been
confirmed.
Pattern Flexibility
It requires that the body of the second day be less than 27% of the
high-low range. This is the same body size requirement as for the
Shooting Star pattern. In fact, the second day will often resemble a
Shooting Star line.

Chapter Three
The first and third days have long bodies. The body of a candle-
stick is the part between the open and the close. A long body is a
body that occupies more than 50% of the high-low range. Do not
confuse a long body requirement with a long day requirement.
Although the third day’s body is relatively small, it is still a long body
when compared to its high-low range.
Pattern Breakdown
The Unique Three Mountain Top reduces to a small white body with
a long upper shadow. This is does not fully support the bearish rever-
sal and confirmation is suggested.

Chapter Three
Figure 3-98
Commentary
The Three White Soldiers pattern is a vital part of the Sakata Method
described in Chapter 5. It shows a series of long white candlesticks
that progressively close at higher prices. It is also best if prices open
in the middle of the previous day’s range (body). This stair-step
action is quite bullish and shows the downtrend has abruptly ended.
Rules of Recognition
1. Three consecutive long white lines occur, each with a higher
close.
2. Each should open within the previous body.
3. Each should close at or near the high for the day.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
The Three White Soldiers pattern occurs in a downtrend and is rep-
resentative of a strong reversal in the market. Each day opens lower
but then closes to a new short-term high. This type of price action is
very bullish and should never be ignored.

Reversal Candle Patterns
Pattern Flexibility
The opening prices of the second and third days can be anywhere
within the previous body. However, it is better to see the open above
the midpoint of the previous day’s body. Keep in mind that when a
day opens for trading, some selling has to exist to open below the
previous close. This suggests that a healthy rise is always accompa-
nied by some selling.
Pattern Breakdown
The Three White Soldiers pattern reduces to a very bullish long white
candle line (Figure 3-99). This breakdown is in full support of the
pattern, which makes confirmation unnecessary.

Reversal Candle Patterns
Figure 3-101
Commentary
The Three Black Crows is the counterpart of the Three White Sol-
diers pattern. Occurring during an uptrend, three long black days are
stair-stepping downward. “Bad news has wings,” an old Japanese
expression, easily fits this pattern. Each day opens slightly higher
than the previous day’s close, but then drops to a new closing low.
When this occurs three times, a clear message of trend reversal has
been sent. Be careful that this downward progression does not get
overextended. That would surely cause some bottom picking from
the eternal bulls.
Rules of Recognition
1. Three consecutive long black days occur.
2. Each day closes at a new low.
3. Each day opens within the body of the previous day.
4. Each day closes at or neat its lows.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
The market is either approaching a top or has been at a high level for
some time. A decisive trend move to the downside is made with a

long black day. The next two days are accompanied by further ero-
sion in prices caused by much selling and profit taking. This type of
price actions has to take its toll on the bullish mentality.
Pattern Flexibility
It would be good to see the real body of the first candlestick of the
three Black Crows under the prior white day’s high. This would
accelerate the bearishness of this pattern.
Pattern Breakdown
The Three Black Crows pattern reduces to a long black candlestick,
which fully supports this pattern’s bearishness (Figure 3-102).

in this pattern.
Pattern Flexibility
Because this pattern is a special version of the Three Black Crows
pattern, flexibility is almost nonexistent. This pattern has been
excluded from most of the statistical testing in later chapters.

reduces to a long black candlestick (Figure 3-105). This fully sup-
ports the pattern’s bearish implications.

A shown in Figure 3-107, this pattern is a derivation of the Three

Advanced Block pattern show weakness. The long upper shadows

Chapter Three
show that the price extremes reached during the day cannot hold.
This type of action after an uptrend and then for two days in a row
should make any bullish market participants nervous, especially if
the uptrend was getting overextended.
Remember that this pattern occurs in an uptrend. Most multiple-
day patterns begin with a long day, which helps support the existing
trend. The two days with long upper shadows show that there is
profit taking because the rise is losing its power.
Rules of Recognition
1. Three white days occur with consecutively higher closes.
2. Each day opens within the previous day’s body.
3. A definite deterioration in the upward strength is evidenced
by long upper shadows on the second and third days.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
The scenario of the Advance Block pattern closely resembles the events
that could take place with the Three White Soldiers pattern. This situ-
ation, however, does not materialize into a strong advance. Rather, it
weakens after the first day because the close is significantly lower than
the high. The third day is as weak as the second day. Remember, weak-
ness in this context is relative to the Three White Soldiers pattern.
Pattern Flexibility
Defining deterioration is difficult. Although this pattern starts out
like the Three White Soldiers, if doesn’t produce the upward strength
and each day shows smaller body length and longer shadows. The
second and third day need to trade higher than their closes.

Reversal Candle Patterns
Pattern Breakdown
The Advance Block pattern reduces to a long white candle line that is
not quite as long as the Three White Soldiers breakdown (Figure
3-108). This long white candlestick also has a long upper shadow,
which shows that the prices did not close nearly as high as they got
during the trading days. Because of this, the Advance Block is viewed
as a bearish pattern. In most cases, this only means that long posi-
tions should be protected.

Reversal Candle Patterns
Figure 3-110
Commentary
The Descent Block pattern is a three-day bullish reversal pattern. It
was created as the complement to the Advanced Block pattern.
Rules of Recognition
1. The pattern begins with a long black day that occurs in a
downtrend.
2. The next two days are also black days with each closing
below the prior day’s close.
3. The last two days also have long lower shadows.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
The first day of the pattern is a long black day that occurs in a down-
trend. The midpoint value of the first day is below a 10-period mov-
ing average. The second day is also a black day that closes below the
first day’s close. After two black days, the current downtrend seems
secure, and the bears are sure to be happy.

Chapter Three
The strength of the downtrend attracts new bears, and the third
day is another black day that closes below the close of the previous
day. With three consecutive black days in a downtrend, the bears are
probably becoming complacent.
But, upon closer examination, the Descent Block pattern shows
that the current downtrend is actually exhibiting signs of weakness.
First, the body range of each day is less than that of the preceding
day. Second, each day opens within the prior day’s body (there are no
gaps between the real bodies in the pattern). Third and last, the sec-
ond and third days have long lower shadows. Specifically, the lower
shadows must occupy more than 40% of the days’ high-low ranges.
And so, while the second and third days are making lower closes,
the distance between the closes is most likely shrinking. This means
that the strength of the downtrend is deteriorating and shorts should
protect themselves.
Pattern Flexibility
The first day of the Descent Block pattern must have a long body. The
body of a candlestick is the part between the open and the close. A long
body is a body that occupies more than 50% of the high-low range.
Pattern Breakdown
The Descent Block pattern breaks down into a long black candle line,
so confirmation is suggested.

Commentary
Bearish Deliberation
As illustrated in Figure 3-113, the Bearish Deliberation pattern is also
a derivative of the Three White Soldiers pattern. The first two long
white candlesticks make a new high and are followed by a small
white candlestick or a star. This pattern is also called a Stalled pattern
in some literature. It is best if the last day gaps above the second day.
Being a small body, this shows the indecision necessary to arrest the
upmove. This indecision is the time of deliberation. A further confir-
mation could easily turn this pattern into an Evening Star pattern.
Bullish Deliberation
The Bullish Deliberation pattern is a three-day bullish reversal pat-
tern. The pattern begins with two consecutive long black days that
occur in a downtrend. This pattern was created as the bullish coun-
terpart to the bearish Deliberation pattern.

Chapter Three
Rules of Recognition
Bearish Deliberation
1. The first and second day have long white bodies.
2. The third day opens near the second day’s close.
3. The third day is a Spinning Top and most probably a star.
Bullish Deliberation
1. The first day of the pattern is a long black day that occurs
in a downtrend.
2. The second day is also a long black day.
3. The third day is a Star or relatively small black day that
may gap away from the prior day’s black real body.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
Bearish Deliberation
This pattern exhibits a weakness similar to the Advance Block pat-
tern in that it gets weak in a short period of time. The difference is
that the weakness occurs all at once on the third day. The Delibera-
tion pattern occurs after a sustained upward move and shows that
trends cannot last forever. As with the Advance Block, defining the
deterioration of the trend can be difficult.
Bullish Deliberation
After two long black days, the current downtrend seems secure, and
the bears are sure to be happy. The strength of the downtrend attracts
new bears, and the third day opens at or below the close of the previ-
ous day. The third day is also a black day. With three consecutive black
days in a downtrend, the bears are probably becoming complacent.
But, upon closer examination, the bullish Deliberation pattern

Reversal Candle Patterns
shows that the current downtrend is actually exhibiting signs of
weakness. First, the high-low range of the third day is less than that
of the second day. Specifically, it is less than 75% of the second day’s
high-low range. Second, the body range of the third day is less than
the body range of the second day. The program requires that it be less
than 50% of the second day’s body range. Third and last, even
though the black real body of the third day may gap away from the
black real body of the second day, the gap is less than 20% of the sec-
ond day’s high-low range.
Pattern Flexibility
Bearish Deliberation
If the third white body is also a star, watch for the next day to gener-
ate a possible Evening Star pattern.
Bullish Deliberation
And so, while the second and third days are making lower closes, the
distance between the closes is most likely shrinking. This means that
the strength of the downtrend is deteriorating. If the third day is a
Star or a Doji Star, watch for the next day to generate a possible
Morning Star or Morning Doji Star pattern.
Pattern Breakdown
Bearish Deliberation
The Deliberation pattern reduces to a long white candlestick (Figure
3-115). This is in direct conflict with the pattern itself, which suggest
the need for further confirmation. A gap down on the following day
would produce an Evening Star and therefore support this pattern’s
bearishness.

Bullish Deliberation
The first two long black days of the bullish Deliberation pattern must
have long bodies. The body of a candlestick is the part between the

50% of the high-low range. The long black day is in conflict with this
pattern.

factthatthisgapwasfilledsoquicklysomewhateliminatedthetradi-
tionalgapanalysis,whichwouldindicateacontinuationofthetrend.
Rules of Recognition
1. The trend continues with a long white day.
2. The second day is a gap up and a black day.
3. The third day is also a black day.
4. The third day opens inside the body of the second day and
closes inside the body if the first day.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
The market has had a extended up move. A gap higher followed by a
lower close for the second day shows that there is some weakness in
the rally. The third day opens higher, but not above the open of the
previous day, and then sells off. This sell-off closes well into the body
of the first day. This action fills the gap after only the second day. The
bullishness has to be eroding quickly.
Pattern Flexibility
The Two Crows pattern is slightly more bearish than the Upside Gap
Two crows pattern. The third day is a long black day, which needs to
close only inside the body of the first day. The longer this black day
is and the lower it closes into the first day, the more bearish it is.
Pattern Breakdown
The Two Crows pattern reduces to a possible Shooting Star line (Fig-
ure 3-120). This would support the bearishness of the Two Crows
pattern.

The Two Crows pattern is similar to the Dark Cloud Cover in that it
represents a short-term top in the market. If the second and third
days were combined into one, the pattern would become a Dark
Cloud Cover. The Upside Gap Two Crows is slightly different in that
the third day does not close into the body of the first day. It also is a
weak version of the Evening Star, except that there is no gap between
the second and third bodies.

Chapter Three
Figure 3-122
Commentary
The Two Rabbits pattern is a three-day bullish reversal pattern. The
last two days’ white candlesticks represent two white rabbits ready to
jump out of their burrow. The Two Rabbits pattern was created as
the bullish counterpart to the Two Crows pattern.
Rules of Recognition
1. The pattern begins with a black day that occurs during a
downtrend.
2. The second day is a downward gapping white day.
3. The third day is also a white day that opens inside the body
of the second day and then closes inside the body of the
first day.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
The Two Rabbits pattern starts with a long black day. The midpoint
of the range of the first day is below a 10-period moving average.



==================================================
                     PAGE 182                     
==================================================

Reversal Candle Patterns
This means that a downtrend has been in place. The long black day
adds to the bearishness already present.
The next day opens lower with a gap. The new low does not hold,
however, and the day actually forms a white candlestick. The bears
are not shaken by this day because the close of the white day is still
below the close of the first day.
The third day opens inside the body of the second day and then
closes inside the body of the first day. The fact that the gap between
the first and second days was filled so quickly goes counter to tradi-
tional gap analysis, which would indicate a continuation of the down-
trend.
Pattern Flexibility
Note: This also requires that the gap between the real bodies of the
first and second days be greater than 10% of the high-low range of
the first day.
All three days must also have long bodies. The body of a candle-
stick is the part between the open and the close. A long body is a
body that occupies more than 50% of the high-low range.
Pattern Breakdown
The Two Rabbits pattern (Figure 3-123) reduces to a Hammer line.
This supports the bullishness of the pattern.
Related Patterns
The Two Rabbits pattern is similar to the Downside Gap Two Rab-
bits pattern.

Chapter Three
Commentary
The Three Inside Up and Three Inside Down patterns are confirma-
tions for the Harami pattern. As shown in Figure 3-125 and 3-126,
the first two days are exactly the same as the Harami. This third day
is a confirming close day with respect to the bullish or bearish case.
A bullish Harami followed by a third day that closes higher would be
a Three Inside Up pattern. Similarly, a bearish Harami with a lower
close on the third day would be a Three Inside Down pattern.
The Three Inside Up and Three Inside Down patterns are not
found in any Japanese literature. We developed them to assist in
improving the overall results of the Harami pattern, and they have
done quite well.
Rules of Recognition
1. A Harami pattern is first identified using all previously set
rules.
2. The third day shows a higher close for a Three Inside Up
and a lower close for a Three Inside Down.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
This pattern, being a confirmation for the Harami, can represent
the success of the Harami pattern only by moving in the forecast
direction.
Pattern Flexibility
Because this pattern is a confirmation of the Harami pattern, the
flexibility would be the same as that of the Harami. The amount of

the engulfment and size of the second day helps to strengthen or
weaken this pattern, as the case may be.
Pattern Breakdown
The bullish Three Inside Up pattern reduces to a bullish Hammer,
which supports the pattern (Figure 3-127). The bearish Three Inside
Down reduces to a bearish Shooting Star line, which also supports it
(Figure 3-128).

Chapter Three
Commentary
The Three Outside Up and Three Outside Down patterns (Figure 3-130
and 3-131) are confirmations for the Engulfing patterns. The concept
is identical to the Three Inside Up and Three Inside Down patterns
and how they worked with the Harami. Here, the Engulfing pattern
is followed by either a higher or a lower close on the third day,
depending on whether the pattern is up or down.
The Three Outside Up and Three Outside Down patterns are not
found in any Japanese literature. We developed them to assist in
improving the overall results of the Engulfing pattern, and they have
done quite well.
Pattern Recognition
1. An Engulfing pattern is formed using all of the previously
set rules.
2. The third day has a higher close for the Threee Outside Up
pattern and a lower for a Three Outside Down pattern.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
These patterns, representing the confirmation of the Engulfing pat-
tern, can only show the success of the forecast of the appropriate
Engulfing pattern.
Pattern Flexibility
Confirmation patterns do not have any more flexibility than the
underlying pattern. The amount of confirmation made on the last
day can influence the magnitude of this pattern’s forecast.

Reversal Candle Patterns
Pattern Breakdown
The bullish Three Outside Up pattern reduces to a possible Hammer
line (Figure 3-132), and the bearish Three Outside Down reduces to
a possible Shooting Star line (Figure 3-133). The word possible is
used here because the difference between the first day’s open and the
third day’s close can be significant, which would negate the Hammer
and Shooting Star line. The supporting point is that the body will be
the color of the sentiment.

Figure 3-135
Commentary
This pattern shows a downtrend slowly deteriorating with less and
less daily price movement and consecutively higher lows (Figure
3-135). The long lower shadow on the first day is crucial to this pat-
tern because it is the first sign of buying enthusiasm. The next day
opens higher, trades lower, but does not go lower than the previous
day’s low. The second day also closes off of its low. The third day is
a Black Marubozu and is engulfed by the previous day’s range.

==================================================

(cid:2) 164
Chapter Three
Rules of Recognition
1. The first day is a long black day with a long lower shadow
(Hammer-like).
2. The second day has the same basic shape as the first day,
only smaller. The low is above the previous day’s low.
3. The third day is a small Black Marubozu that opens and
closes inside the previous day’s range.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
A downtrend has continued when, after a new low has been made, a
rally closes well above the low. This will cause some concern among
the shorts because it represents buying, something that has not been
happening until now. The second day opens higher, which lets some
longs get out of their positions. However, that is the high for the day.
Trading is lower, but not lower than the previous day, which causes a
rally to close above the low. The bears are certainly concerned now
because of the higher low. The last day is a day of indecision, with
hardly any price movement. Anyone who is still short will not want
to see anything more to the up side.
Pattern Flexibility
The last day of this pattern could have small shadows that probably
would not greatly affect the outcome. Basically, each consecutive day
is engulfed by the previous day’s range.
Pattern Breakdown
This pattern reduces to a long black line, which is normally quite
bearish (Figure 3-136). Because of this conflict, definite confirmation
should be required.

This is somewhat like the Three Black Crows, except that the lows
are not lower and the last day is not a long body. Of course, this pat-
tern has a bullish implication, whereas the Three Black Crows pat-
tern is bearish.

Reversal Candle Patterns
Rules of Recognition
1. The pattern consists of three white days, with the second
and third days each making a lower high and a higher low
than the preceding day.
2. The Three Stars in the North pattern begins with a long
white day. The midpoint value of the first day is above a
10-period moving average. This means that an uptrend is
in place.
3. It is strongly recommended that the first day’s upper
shadow occupy more than 40% of the day’s high-low
range. The first day also has little or no lower shadow. It is
also recommended that the first day’s lower shadow should
occupy less than 7.5% of the high-low range.
4. The second day opens below the close of the first day,
trades higher, and finally closes above the close of the first
day. The high of the second day is below the high of the
first day. The second day has the same upper and lower
shadow requirements as the first day.
5. The third day is a small White Marubozu that opens and
closes inside the high-low range of the second day. A White
Marubozu is a white candlestick line with little or no upper
and lower shadows.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
The Three Stars in the North pattern shows an uptrend slowly dete-
riorating with less and less daily price movement and consecutively
lower highs and higher lows. The first day of the pattern also has a
long upper shadow. The long upper shadow is crucial to this pattern
because it is the first sign of sellers coming into the market.

Pattern Flexibility
Because of the many definitional requirements of this pattern, it is a
very rare pattern. In fact, you must widen your acceptance of slight
differences in the candle lines. Otherwise it would never appear at all.
You see, Marubozu days are very rare. That coupled with the shadow
requirements of the first two days make this pattern extremely rare.
We did not tamper with the shadow requirements of the first two
days, but we did change the body size requirement of the third day.
Instead of requiring that the third day be a Marubozu day, we require
only that the third day’s body range be greater than 50% of its high-
low range. Typically, it is recommended that a single Marubozu day
should have a body range that is greater than 90% of the day’s high-
low range.
Pattern Breakdown
Because the pattern reduces to a long white candlestick line, confir-
mation is required.

Commentary
Bullish Stick Sandwich
In the bullish Stick Sandwich pattern, two black bodies have a white
body between them (Figure 3-141). The closing prices of the two
black bodies must be equal. A support price has been found and the
opportunity for prices to reverse is quite good.
Bearish Stick Sandwich
The bearish Stick Sandwich pattern (Figure 3-142) is a three-day
bearish reversal pattern. It was created as the bearish counterpart to
the bullish Stick Sandwich pattern.

Reversal Candle Patterns
Rules of Recognition
Bullish Stick Sandwich
1. A black body in a downtrend is followed by a white body
that trades above the close of the previous black body.
2. The third day is a black day with a close equal to the first
day.
Bearish Stick Sandwich
1. The pattern starts with a white day that occurs during an
uptrend.
2. The second day has a black real body that opens below the
previous day’s close and closes below the previous day’s
open.
3. The third day is a white real body that engulfs the second
day’s black real body.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
Bullish Stick Sandwich
A good downtrend is underway. Prices open higher on the next trading
day and then trade higher all day, closing at or neat the high. This
action suggests that the previous downtrend has probably reversed and
that shorts should be protected, if not covered. The next day, prices
open even higher, which should cause some covering initially, but then
prices drift lower to close at the same price as two days ago. Anyone
who does not note support and resistance points in the market is tak-
ing exceptional risk. Another day of trading should tell the story.
Bearish Stick Sandwich
The key to this pattern is that the closing prices of the first and third
days’ white real bodies must be equal. The bearish Stick Sandwich

Chapter Three
pattern begins with a white day. The midpoint value of the first day
is above a 10-period moving average. This means that an uptrend is
in place. Prices open lower on the next day and then trade lower all
day, closing at or near the low for the day. This action suggests that
the uptrend has probably reversed and that any long positions should
be protected, if not closed out.
The next day, prices open even lower, which should cause some
selling initially, but then prices climb higher to close at the same price
as the first day. Anyone who does not note support and resistance
points in the market is taking exceptional risk. Another day of trad-
ing should tell the story.
Pattern Flexibility
Bullish Stick Sandwich
Some Japanese references use the low prices as the support point for
the two black days. Using the close price presents a more memorable
support point and therefore a better chance of reversal.
Bullish Stick Sandwich
Note: The bearish Stick Sandwich pattern does not have any length
of day or length of body requirements for the three days that make
up the pattern (save for the second day, which must have a long body
so that it closes near its low). Therefore, the first day may have a
small body with or without a long upper and/or a long lower
shadow. Accordingly, the bearish Stick Sandwich pattern can break
down into many different candlestick lines, including a long white
candlestick line, a Hanging Man line, or a white real body with long
upper and lower shadows.
Note: Because of decimalization you must allow a very small
amount of flexibility or tolerance into the pattern. You should con-

sider the first and third days to have the same closing price as long as
the third day’s closing price is within one one-thousandth (1⁄ ) of the
1000
first day’s closing price. So, for example, if the first day closes at 20,
the third day is permitted to close between 19.98 and 20.02.

Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
Bullish Squeeze Alert
What is important about the pattern is that it shows that the down-
trend has stalled, and some basing or stability has finally arrived. If
the first day or two immediately following the pattern move up, then
prices should break out to the upside. If the first day or two immedi-
ately following the pattern move down, then prices should break out
to the downside.
Bearish Squeeze Alert
What is important about the pattern is that it shows that the uptrend
has stalled, and some plateauing or stability has finally arrived. If the
first day or two immediately following the pattern move up, then
prices should break out to the upside. If the first day or two immedi-
ately following the pattern move down, then prices should break out
to the downside.
Note: The pattern was created more as an alert than an actual pat-
tern. You should wait to see which way prices go following the pat-
tern before acting on it.

Commentary
Bullish Breakaway
The bullish Breakaway pattern comes during a downtrend and rep-
resents an acceleration of selling to a possible oversold position. The
pattern starts with a long black day followed by another black day
whose body gaps down (Figure 3-153). After the down gap, the next
three days set consecutively lower prices. All days in this pattern are
black, with the exception of the third day, which may be either black
or white. The three days after the gap are similar to the Three Black
Crows in that their highs and lows are each consecutively lower. The
last day completely erases the small black days and closes inside the
gap between the first and second days.
Bearish Breakaway
The bearish Breakaway pattern involves a gap in the direction of
the trend followed by three consecutively higher-price days (Figure
3-154). In an uptrend, a long white day is formed. Then the next day,
prices gap upward to form another white day. This is followed by two
more days that set higher prices. The color of the days should be white
with only one exception: the third day of the pattern, or the second

Reversal Candle Patterns
day after the gap, may be either black or white as long as a new high
price has been made. The low prices set in the three days after the gap
should also be higher than each previous day’s low price. The idea of
this pattern is that prices have accelerated in the direction of the trend
and an overbought situation is developing. The last day sets up the
trend reversal by closing inside the gap of the first and second days.
Japanese literature does not discuss a bearish version of the Break-
away pattern. I decided to test such a pattern and have found that it
works quite well. See Chapter 6 for results.
Rules of Recognition
1. The first day is a long day with color representing the cur-
rent trend.
2. The second day is the same color and the body gaps in the
direction of the trend.
3. The third and fourth days continue the trend direction, with
closes consecutively greater in the direction of trend. It is
better if the third day is white for the bullish case and black
for the bearish case.
4. The fifth day is a long opposite-color day that closes inside
the gap caused by the first and second days.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
It is important to realize what is being accomplished here: the trend
has accelerated with a big gap and then starts to fizzle, but it still
moves in the same direction. The slow deterioration of the trend is
quite evident from this pattern. Finally, a burst in the opposite direc-
tion completely recovers the previous three days’ price action. What
causes the reversal implication is that the gap has not been filled. A
short-term reversal has taken place.

Chapter Three
Pattern Flexibility
Because this is a complex pattern, it is difficult to discuss flexibility.
A long as the basic premise is maintained, this pattern can offer some
flexibility. There could be more than three days after the gap as long
as the last day of the pattern closes inside the initial gap. It is also
possible to have at least two days after the gap.
Pattern Breakdown
The bullish Breakaway pattern reduces into a possible Hammer line
(Figure 3-155). The lower shadow must be twice the length of the
body for it to qualify as a Hammer. This is quite possible if the gap in
the second day is large and followed by significantly lower prices on
days three and four. This, of course, supports the pattern.
The bearish Breakaway pattern reduces to a long candle line with a
white body at the lower end of its range (Figure 3-156). Chances are
that this would not be a Shooting Star because of the large gap on the
second day and the higher prices that followed. It seems that the bear-
ish Breakaway would require further confirmation before selling.

Two Black Marubozu days support the strength of the downtrend
(Figure 3-158). On the third day, the downtrend begins to deterio-
rate, with a period of trading above the open price. This is especially

important because the open was gapped down from the previous
day’s close. The fourth day completely engulfs the third day, includ-
ing the upper shadow. Even though the close is at a new low, the
velocity of the previous downtrend has eroded significantly and
shorts should be protected.
Rules of Recognition
1. Two Black Marubozu days make up the first two days of
the pattern.
2. The third day is black with a down gap open. However, this
day trades into the body of the previous day, producing a
long upper shadow.
3. The fourth black day completely engulfs the third day,
including the shadow.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
Any time a downtrend can continue with two Black Marubozu days,
the bears must be excited. Then on the third day, the open is gapped
down, which also adds to the excitement. However, trading during
this day goes above the close of the previous day and causes some
real concern about the downtrend, even though the day closes at or
near its low. The next day opens significantly higher with a gap. After
the opening, however, the market sells off and closes at a new low.
This last day gives the shorts an excellent opportunity to cover their
short positions.
Pattern Flexibility
This is a very strict pattern and does not allow much in the way of
flexibility. The gap between the second and third day is necessary,

and the upper shadow of the third day must extend into the previous
day’s range. To meet all of these requirements, only a few changes in
relative size can be allowed.

This pattern reduces to a long black day, which is almost always con-
sidered a bearish day (Figure 3-159). Because of this direct conflict,

Concealing Baby Swallow resembles the Three Black Crow here, as
did the Three Stars in the South pattern. However, the Three Black
Crows is a bearish pattern and must be in an uptrend to be valid,
whereas this pattern occurs in a downtrend. This pattern starts out
much like the Ladder Bottom pattern.

Figure 3-161
Commentary
After a reasonable downtrend with four consecutive lower closes and
black days, the market trades higher than the open (Figure 3-161).
This action is the first indication of buying even though the market still
closes at a new low. On the next day, prices gap higher and never look
back. The last day closes much higher than the previous day or two.
Rules of Recognition
1. Three long black days with consecutive lower opens and
closes occur much like the Three Black Crows pattern.
2. The fourth day is black with an upper shadow.
3. The last day is white with an open above the body of the
previous day.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
A downtrend has been in place for some time and the bears are sure
to be complacent. After a good move to the downside, prices trade

above the open price and almost reach the high price of the previ-
ous day, but then they close at another new low. This action cer-
tainly will get the attention of the shorts and shows that the market
will not go down forever. The shorts will rethink their position and,
if profits are good, the next day they will sell. This action causes a
gap up on the last day of the pattern and the close is considerably
higher. If volume is high on the last day, a trend reversal has proba-
bly occurred.
Pattern Flexibility
The four black days of the Ladder Bottom pattern may or may not be
long, but consecutively lower closes must occur. The last day must be
white and may be either long or short, as long as the close is above
the previous day’s high.
Pattern Breakdown
The Ladder Bottom reduces to Hammer pattern, which supports its
bullish implications.

Chapter Three
Rules of Recognition
1. The pattern begins with three white days with consecutively
higher opens and closes.
2. The fourth day is also a white day with a lower shadow
that extends down well into the third day.
3. The fifth day is a black day that opens below the body of
the fourth day and then closes below the low of the fourth
day.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
The Ladder Top pattern starts with three white days that all occur
in an uptrend. The midpoint value of each white day is above a
10-period moving average. The three white days have consecutively
higher tops and bottoms. The bulls are sure to be complacent at this
point.
The fourth day is also a white day, but it has a lower shadow that
extends down well into the prior day. Specifically, the low of the
fourth day must be lower than the midpoint value of the third day.
And, although the fourth day closes higher than the third day, in
most cases, the fourth day will show that the strength of the uptrend
is weakening. The action of the fourth day should certainly get the
attention of the bulls. If their profits are good, the next day the bulls
should sell.
Pattern Flexibility
Note: The four white days do not have any length of day or length of
body requirements, apart from the lower shadow requirement of the
fourth day (the lower shadow must occupy more than 40% of the
high-low range of the fourth day). Therefore, one or more (or even
all) of the four days may have small real bodies with long upper

Reversal Candle Patterns
and/or lower shadows. The fourth day may even have an upper
shadow if it has a small real body. All that is required of the four
white days is that they have consecutively higher opens and closes.
The fifth day is a black day that gaps way down to open below the
previous day’s open. This fifth day then closes below the previous
day’s low. Note: The fifth day does not have any length of day or
length of body requirements. Therefore, the fifth day is not required
to have a long real body.
For this pattern, you should also require that the fifth day close
above the low of the first white day. You do not want the fifth day to
recover all of the first four days’ price action.
Pattern Breakdown
The Ladder Top pattern reduces to a Shooting Star line, which sup-
ports the bearishness of the pattern. If the price advance made by the
four white days is quite significant, then the pattern reduces to a long
white real body with a short upper shadow.

Chapter Three
Related Patterns
The Ladder Top pattern is similar to the Belt Hold pattern. Both pat-
terns start with four white days that occur in an uptrend, followed by
a fifth day that is black. The strength of the Belt Hold pattern comes
from the length of the black day, plus the fact that the black day
opened on its high. The strength of the Ladder Top pattern comes
from the weakening uptrend (as evidenced by the fourth day), fol-
lowed by the gap down opening of the black day.

Rules of Recognition
1. The pattern begins with a long black day that occurs during
a downtrend.
2. The next two days are also black days, and each one closes
lower than the previous day’s close.
3. The third day gaps down and opens below the close of the
second day.
4. The fourth day is a long white day.
5. The fifth day is another long white day that gaps upward to
open above the previous day’s close.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
All five days of this pattern are long days with long bodies. The pat-
tern begins with a long black day that occurs during a downtrend.
The next two days are also black days, and each one closes lower
than the previous day’s close. This creates a market with an extended
down move. In fact, the third day actually gaps down and opens
below the close of the second day. The fourth day is a long white day
that shows there might be some weakness finally to the extended
decline. The fifth day is another long white day that gaps upward to
open above the previous day’s close. The fifth day closes near its
highs, thereby creating a long white real body. It now appears that
the market overextended itself to the downside, and a reversal of the
prior trend has begun.
Pattern Flexibility
For this pattern, you should also require that the fifth day close
below the high of the first day. You don’t want the last two days to
recover all of the first three days’ price action.

Reversal Candle Patterns
According to Sakata’s Method, after a market bottom, you should
sell on the third gap up. At that point, on the third gap up, Sakata’s
Method recommends selling because of the conflict of orders and the
possibility of reaching overbought conditions soon.
The gap up in this pattern would be considered the first gap up.
Should that gap up be followed by two more consecutive gap ups
then, according to Sakata’s Method, you should then sell a long
position.
Note: This also requires that the gap between the two real bodies
of any gap up or gap down pair of candlestick lines be greater than
10% of the high-low range of the first day.
Pattern Breakdown
This five-day pattern reduces to a bullish Hammer. This supports the
bullish reversal of the After Bottom Gap Up pattern.

Reversal Candle Patterns
Commentary
The Three Gap Downs pattern is a four-day bullish reversal pattern.
The pattern is what its name says it is—three consecutive days that
each gaps lower on the open. Normally, a Gap Down pattern would
be an indication of lower prices to come but, after three gap downs,
the market has become very oversold and is ready for a break in, or
reversal of, the current downtrend.
Rules of Recognition
1. The first day of the pattern can be any color—it really just
serves as the first day of the first gap down.
2. The second day can also be any color, so long as its real
body gaps down and away from the first day’s real body.
3. The last two days must be long days with long bodies.
4. The last two days must also be black.
5. The real body of each of the last two days gaps down and
away from the real body of the prior day.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
The third day then opens below the bottom of the prior day. Prices
decline steadily all day long and close near their lows. The next day,
the market gaps lower on the open for the third consecutive day.
Prices trade lower all day and again close near their lows. The mar-
ket has now had three gap downs in a row. According to Sakata’s
Method, you should cover a short position on the third gap down. At
that point, on the third gap down, Sakata’s Method recommends
covering because of the conflict of orders and the possibility of reach-
ing oversold conditions soon.

For this pattern, you should require that the market be in a down-
trend by the second day of the pattern. Therefore, the midpoint of the
range of the second day will be below a 10-period moving average.
Note: This also requires that the three gaps between the four real
bodies of this pattern be greater than 10% of the high-low range of
the first day of any pair of real bodies.
Pattern Breakdown
Because of the flexibility of this pattern, the breakdown analysis is
not conclusive.

The third day then opens above the top of the prior day. Prices
climb steadily all day long and close near their highs. The next day,
the market gaps higher on the open for the third consecutive day.

CHAPTER FOUR
Continuation Patterns
Continuation Patterns are included in a separate chapter from rever-
sal patterns only to make later reference easier. Keep in mind that
once a pattern has been identified, it is suggesting a direction for
future price movement. It really doesn’t matter if that future price
movement is the same as before or is a reversal. Continuation pat-
terns, according to the Sakata Method, are a time of rest in the mar-
ket. Whatever the pattern, you must make a decision on your current
position, even if that decision is to stay where you are.
The format of discussion for this chapter is identical to that of the
previous chapter (3) on reversal candle patterns. In condensed form,
that format is

Commentary
The Separating Lines have the same open and are opposite in color.
They are similar, but opposite of the Meeting Lines. The second day
of these patterns is a Belt Hold candlestick. The bullish pattern (Fig-
ure 4-1) has a white bullish Belt Hold and the bearish pattern (Figure
4-2) has a black bearish Belt Hold. Ikichigaisenmeans lines that move
in opposite directions. Sometimes these are called Dividing (furiwake)
Lines.
Rules of Recognition
1. The first day is the opposite color of the current trend.
2. The second day is the opposite color of the first.
3. The two bodies meet in the middle, at the open price.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
An uptrend is in place when a long black day occurs. This is not nor-
mal for a strong market and will produce some skepticism. However,

Continuation Patterns
the next day opens much higher; in fact, it opens at the previous
black day’s opening price. Prices then move higher for the rest of the
day and close higher, which suggests that the prior uptrend should
now continue. This scenario is for the bullish Separating Line; the
bearish scenario is quite similar, but opposite.
Pattern Flexibility
Separating Lines should each be long lines: however, there is no require-
ment that this be so. Strong furiwake lines would be two long bodies
without any shadows (marubozu) at the points where they meet.
Pattern Breakdown
The bullish Separating Lines pattern reduces to a candle line with a
white body and long lower shadow (Figure 4-3). This pattern is some-
what bullish and supports the bullish continuation. The bearish Sepa-
rating Lines pattern reduces to a candle line with a black body near
the lower portion of the range (Figure 4-4). This line can be consid-
ered bearish and therefore supports the bearish continuation pattern.

Commentary
The bearish On Neck Line is an undeveloped version of the Piercing
Line discussed in Chapter 3. A similar pattern is formed, except that
the second day’s white body only gets up to the previous day’s low
(Figure 4-6). Do not confuse this pattern with the Meeting Line pat-
tern covered in Chapter 3.

Continuation Patterns
The bullish On Neck Line pattern is a two-day bullish continuation
pattern. It was created as a complement to the bearish On Neck Line.
Note: This pattern is rare.
Rules of Recognition
Bearish On Neck Line
1. A long black line is formed in a downtrend.
2. The second day is white and opens below the low of the
previous day. This day does not need to be a long day or it
might resemble the bullish Meeting Line.
3. The second day closes at the low of the first day.
Bullish On Neck Line
1. The first day is a long white day that occurs during an
uptrend.
2. The second day is black. It opens above the high of the pre-
vious day and then closes at the high of the previous day.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
Bearish On Neck Line
The bearish On Neck Line usually appears during a decline. Bearish-
ness is increased with the long black first day. The market gaps down
on the second day, but cannot continue the downtrend. As the mar-
ket rallies, it is stopped at the previous day’s low price. This must be
uncomfortable for the bottom fishers who go into the market that
day. The downtrend should continue shortly.
Bullish On Neck Line
The bullish On Neck Line pattern starts with a long white day. The
midpoint of the range of the first day is above a 10-period moving

average. This means that an uptrend has been in place. Bullishness is
increased with the long white first day.
The market gaps up on the second day but cannot continue the
advance. Although the market declines somewhat, it is stopped at
the previous day’s high. This must be uncomfortable for any shorts
who got into the market that day. The uptrend should continue
shortly.
Pattern Flexibility
Bearish On Neck Line
If the trading volume on the second day is high, the chance of the
downward trend continuing is good.
Bullish On Neck Line
Because the second day is a black day with little or no lower shadow,
it is known as a Black Closing Marubozu. This requires that the
range or length of the second day be smaller than the range or length
of the first day. If the range of the second day is not restricted, and if
the low of the second day is permitted to penetrate into the body of
the first day, then the bullish On Neck Line continuation pattern
would resemble the bearish Meeting Lines reversal pattern.
Both days of the bullish On Neck Line pattern have long bodies.
The body of a candlestick is the part between the open and the close.
A long body is a body that occupies more than 50% of the high-low
range.
Do not confuse a long body requirement with a long day require-
ment. The second day has a long body. This means that the body of
the second day occupies most of its range. The length of the second
day is actually relatively short.

Continuation Patterns
Pattern Breakdown
Bearish On Neck Line
The bearish On Neck Line pattern reduces to a fairly bearish black
candlestick with a long lower shadow (Figure 4-7). This single candle
line supports the bearishness of this continuation pattern.
Figure 4-8
Bullish On Neck Line
The bullish On Neck Line pattern reduces to a fairly bullish white
candlestick line with a long upper shadow. Occurring in an uptrend,
this line can be considered bullish and therefore supports the bullish
continuation pattern.

Commentary
The bearish In Neck Line is also a modified or undeveloped version
of the Piercing Line. The second day’s white body closes near the
close of the previous black day: at the lower part of the body (Figure
4-12). The actual definition requires that it close just inside the pre-
vious day’s body, that is, slightly above the close. It is a higher close

than the bearish On Neck Line, but not much. If the first day’s close
is also at its low (Closing Marubozu), the bearish In Neck and bear-
ish On Neck Line are most probably the same.
The bullish In Neck Line pattern is a two-day bullish continuation
pattern. It was created as the complement of the bearish In Neck Line.
Rules of Recognition
Bearish In Neck Line
1. A black line develops in a downtrend.
2. The second day is a white day with an opening below the
first day’s low.
3. The close of the second day is just barely into the body of
the first day. For all practical purposes, the closes are equal.
Bullish In Neck Line
1. The first day is a long white day that occurs during an
uptrend.
2. The second day is black. It opens above the high of the pre-
vious day and then closes just barely into the body of the
first day.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
Bearish In Neck Line
The scenario is almost identical to the bearish On Neck Line, except
that the downtrend may not continue quite as abruptly because of
the somewhat higher close.
Bullish In Neck Line
The bullish In Neck Line pattern starts with a long white day. The
midpoint of the range of the first day is above a 10-period moving

average. This means that an uptrend has been in place. Bullishness is
increased with the long white first day.
The market gaps up on the second day but cannot continue the
advance. The market declines on this second day and closes just
barely into the body of the previous day. This scenario is very similar
to the bullish On Neck Line pattern, except that the uptrend may not
continue quite as abruptly because of the somewhat lower close in
the bullish In Neck Line pattern.
Pattern Flexibility
Bearish In Neck Line
If the volume on the white day (second day) is heavy, the chance of
the trend’s continuing is good.
Bullish In Neck Line
Because the second day is a black day with little or no lower shadow,
it is known as a Black Closing Marubozu. This requires that the
range or length of the second day be smaller than the range or length
of the first day. If the range of the second day is not restricted, then
the bullish In Neck Line continuation pattern would closely resemble
the Bearish Meeting Lines reversal pattern.
Both days of the bullish In Neck Line pattern have long bodies.
The body of a candlestick is the part between the open and the close.
A long body is a body that occupies more than 50% of the high-low

Do not confuse a long body requirement with a long day require-

the second day occupies most of its range. The length of the second

The bearish In Neck Line, like the bearish On Neck Line, is a weak
beginning to a Piercing Line. It, however, is a little stronger, but not
nearly enough to cause a reversal of trend. You should also note that
this pattern, if both days are near Marubozu, would be like the bull-
ish Meeting Lines pattern.
Also, be careful not to confuse the bearish Meeting Lines reversal
pattern with the bullish On Neck Line and bullish In Neck Line con-
tinuation patterns. All three patterns look very similar.

Commentary
The bearish Thrusting pattern is the third derivative of the Piercing
Line. The bearish Thrusting Line is stronger than either the bearish
On Neck Line or the bearish In Neck Line, but fails to close above
the midpoint of the previous day’s body (Figure 4-18). The second
day is normally a much larger gap down than the bearish In Neck or

bearish On Neck patterns. This makes it a long white day and confir-
mation definitely is needed before adding to shorts positions.
The bullish Thrusting pattern is a two-day bullish continuation
pattern. It was created as the complement of the bearish Thrusting
pattern.
Rules of Recognition
Bearish Thrusting
1. A black day is formed in a downtrend.
2. The second day is white and opens considerably lower than
the low of the first day.
3. The second day closes well into the body of the first day,
but not above the midpoint.
Bullish Thrusting
1. The first day is a long white day that occurs during an
uptrend.
2. The second day is black. It opens way above the high of the
first day and then trades down to close within the body of
the first day, but does not close below the midpoint of the
first day’s body.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
Bearish Thrusting
Much like the bearish On Neck and bearish In Neck Lines, the bear-
ish Thrusting Line represents a failure to rally in a down market.
Because of this failure, the bulls will be discouraged and a lack of
buying will allow the downtrend to continue.

==================================================

(cid:2) 232
Chapter Four
Bullish Thrusting
The bullish Thrusting pattern starts with a long white day. The mid-
point of the range of the first day is above a 10-period moving aver-
age. This means that an uptrend has been in place. Bullishness is
increased with the long white first day.
The market gaps way up on the second day, opening well above the
first day’s high. The market then declines on this second day, closing
into the body of the first day, but not below the midpoint of the body
of the first day. This second day should be viewed as a normal pause
or break in the uptrend, and the uptrend should continue shortly.
Pattern Flexibility
Bearish Thrusting
Because the bearish Thrusting pattern is approaching the bullish
Piercing Line pattern and is slightly better than the bearish On Neck
Line, there is little room for flexibility.
Bullish Thrusting
Because the second day is a black day with little or no lower shadow,
it is known as a Black Closing Marubozu. Both days of the bullish
Thrusting pattern have long bodies. The body of a candlestick is the
part between the open and the close. A long body is a body that occu-
pies more than 50% of the high-low range.
Pattern Breakdown
Bearish Thrusting
The bearish Thrusting pattern reduces to a Hammer line, which is
somewhat in conflict with the bearishness of this pattern (Figure
4-19). Because the bearish Thrusting pattern is so close to being a
Piercing Line pattern, it is easy to see the possibility of no breakdown

Bullish Thrusting
Although the bullish Thrusting continuation pattern looks similar to
the bearish reversal Dark Cloud Cover pattern, there are three impor-
tant differences between the two patterns. The second day of the bull-
ish Thrusting pattern will (1) open way above the first day’s high (we
require that the second day open more than 30% of the first day’s
high-low range higher than the first day’s high), (2) close above the
midpoint of the first day’s body, and (3) close at or very near its low.

ADDITIONAL NOTE ON THE ON NECK, IN NECK, AND
THRUSTING PATTERNS
You may wonder why there are three continuation patterns that are
derived from a failure to complete a Piercing Line. The bearish On
Neck Line, bearish In Neck Line, and bearish Thrusting all represent
failed attempts to reverse the downtrend. Similarly, the bullish ver-
sions of these three represent a failure of the Dark Cloud Cover.
The bullish versions were not part of any Japanese literature and

Commentary
The typical Tasuki line occurs when the price opens lower from a
white line and then closes lower than the previous day’s low. When
the price opens higher from a black day’s close and then closes higher
than its high is the opposite case. Tasuki lines are mentioned in a
number of sources of candlestick literature, but they do not con-
tribute enough to be considered as individual patterns. A Tasuki is a
sash for holding up sleeves. The Tasuki Gaps involve the Tasuki line
after a gap in the direction of the current market trend.
An Upside Tasuki Gap (Figure 4-24) is a white candlestick that has
gapped above the previous white candlestick, then followed by a black
candlestick that closes inside that gap. This last day must also open
inside the second white day’s body. An important point is that the gap
made between the first two days is not filled. The philosophy is that
one should go long on the close of the last day. The same concept
would be true in reverse for a Downside Tasuki Gap (Figure 4-25).

Chapter Four
Rules of Recognition
1. A trend is underway, with a gap between two candlesticks
of the same color.
2. The color of the first two candlesticks represents the pre-
vailing trend.
3. The third day, an opposite-color candlestick opens within
the body of the second day.
4. The third day closes into the gap but does not fully close
the gap.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
The psychology behind a Tasuki Gap is quite simple: Go with the
trend of the gap. The correction day (the third day) did not fill the gap
and the previous trend should continue. This is looked upon as tem-
porary profit taking. The Japanese widely follow gaps (windows).
Therefore, the fact that the gap does not get filled or closed means
that the previous trend should resume.
The literature is sometimes contradictory on gaps. One normally
expects a gap to provide support and/or resistance. The fact that the
gap is tested so quickly is reason to believe that the gap may not pro-
vide its usual analytic ability.
Pattern Flexibility
The first day’s color is not as important as the color of the second and
third days. It is best that it be the same color as the second day, which
would fully support the ongoing trend.
Pattern Breakdown
The Upside Tasuki Gap pattern reduces into a long line with a white
body at the lower end (Figure 4-26). The only support here can be in

the fact that the breakdown is a long white line, which is normally
considered bullish. The Downside Tasuki Gap (Figure 4-27) reduces
to a long black line, which is usually bearish. Because of the lack of
strong support, further confirmation is recommended.
Figure 4-26 Figure 4-27
Related Patterns
The Tasuki lines by themselves are somewhat opposite of the Pierc-
ing Line and the Dark Cloud Cover, which are reversal patterns. The
Upside and Downside Tasuki Gap patterns are very similar to the
Upside and Downside Gap Three Methods pattern discussed later in
this chapter. You will see that they are also in direct conflict with
each other. It might be best to see the statistical results of the pattern
testing in later chapters.

Commentary
Narabi means “in a row” and narabiaka means “white in a row.”
The Japanese literature refers to Side-by-Side Lines, both black and
white, but only indicates a pause or a stalemate when they are by
themselves. The pattern of importance here is two white lines that
have gapped in the direction of the current trend.
Bullish Side-by-Side White Lines
Two white candlesticks of similar size are side-by-side after gapping
above another white candlestick. Not only are they of similar size,
but the opening price should be very close. The Bullish Side-by-Side
White Lines (Figure 4-29) is also referred to as an Upside Gap Side-
by-Side White Lines (unwappanare Narabiaka).

Continuation Patterns
Bearish Side-by-Side White Lines
Side-by-Side White Lines that gap to the downside are very rare.
These are also called Downside Gap Side-by-Side White Lines (Figure
4-30). Despite what appears to be obvious, these two white lines are
looked upon as short covering. This action, like many continuation
patterns, represents the market taking a rest or buying time.
It would be a normal expectation to have two Side-by-Side Black
Lines for this continuation pattern. A downside gap to Side-by-Side
Black Lines would certainly indicate a continuation of the down-
trend. This pattern, however, is not of much use because it portrays
the obvious. Another derivation of these lines would be Side-by-Side
White Lines that do not gap, but are in an uptrending market. These
are called Side-by-Side White Lines in Stalemate (ikizumari narabi-
aka). These indicate that the market is approaching its top and with
limited support.
Rules of Recognition
1. A gap is made in the direction of the trend.
2. The second day is a white candle line.
3. The third day is also a white candle line of about the same
size and opens at about the same price.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
Bullish Side-by-Side White Lines
The market is in a uptrend. A long white candlestick is formed,
which further perpetuates the bullishness. The next day, the market
gaps up on the open and closes still higher. However, on the third
day, the market opens much lower, in fact, as low as the previous

Chapter Four
day’s open. The initial selling that caused the lower open ends
quickly and the market climbs to yet another high. This demonstrates
the force behind the buyers, and the rally should continue.
Bearish Side-by-Side White Lines
A downtrend is further enhanced with a long black candle line fol-
lowed by a large downward gap open on the next day. The market
trades higher all day, but not high enough to close the gap. The third
day opens lower, at about the same open as the second day. Because
of the resistance to further downside action, shorts are covered, caus-
ing the third day also to rally and close higher, but again not high
enough to close the gap. If enough short covering was accomplished
and the rally attempt was not very convincing, the downtrend should
continue.
Pattern Flexibility
Because Side-by-Side White Lines are used only after gapping, there
is not much flexibility in this pattern. The two white lines should be
similar in body length, but this length is not as important as the fact
that they gapped in the direction of the trend. Their opening prices
should be close to the same, though.
Pattern Breakdown
The Upside Gap Side-by-Side White Lines reduce to a long white can-
dlestick, which fully supports the bullish continuation (Figure 4-31).
The Downside Gap Side-by-Side White Lines reduce to a black can-
dlestick with a long lower shadow (Figure 4-32). This single candle
line does not fully support the bearish continuation and suggests fur-
ther confirmation.

Bullish Side-by-Side Black Lines
1. The pattern begins with a long white day that occurs during
an uptrend.
2. The second day is a black day that opens above the previ-

3. The second day trades lower, but never low enough to close
the gap.
4. The third day opens higher, opening above the midpoint of
the previous day. Prices drop, however, and the third day
ends up closing down for the day. The third day does not
close low enough to fill the gap formed by the first two days.
Bearish Side-by-Side Black Lines
1. The pattern begins with a long black day that occurs during

2. The second day is also a long black day that opens below

ever, and the third day ends up closing down for the day.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
Bullish Side-by-Side Black Lines
The bullish Side-by-Side Black Lines pattern starts with a long white
day. The midpoint of the range of the first day is above a 10-period
moving average. This means that an uptrend has been in place. The
long white day adds to the bullishness already present.

Continuation Patterns
The next day opens way up. The market trades lower, but not low
enough to close the gap. The third day opens higher, opening above
the midpoint of the previous day. Like the second day, prices decline
on the third day, but not low enough to fill the gap formed by the
first and second days. The closing prices for the second and third
days are about equal. The two black candlestick lines in this pattern
are looked upon as profit taking. Once the profit taking ends, the
uptrend should continue.
Bearish Side-by-Side Black Lines
The bearish Side-by-Side Black Lines pattern starts with a long black
day. The midpoint of the range of the first day is below a 10-period
moving average. This means that a downtrend has been in place. The
long black day adds to the bearishness already present.
The next day opens lower with a gap and closes still lower. How-
ever, on the third day, the market opens much higher, opening at
about the same price as the prior day’s opening price. The initial buy-
ing that caused the higher open ends quickly and prices drop. The
second day closes down for the day. This demonstrates the force
behind the sellers, and the downtrend should continue.
Pattern Flexibility
Bullish Side-by-Side Black Lines
With this pattern, you should ensure that the high-low range of the
first day is greater than the average of the five days’ high-low ranges
that immediately precede the pattern. The first day must have a long
body. The body of a candlestick is the part between the open and the
close. A long body is a body that occupies more than 50% of the
high-low range. The second and third days must have bodies that are
not dojis.

Chapter Four
Finally, the high-low ranges and the body ranges of the second and
third days of the pattern should be roughly the same size. Specifically,
we require that the shorter of the high-low ranges of the two days be
greater than 50% of the longer of the high-low ranges of the two
days. This means that the high-low range of one day will never be
more than two times the high-low range of the other day. We also
require that the shorter of the body ranges of the two days be greater
than 50% of the longer of the body ranges of the two days. This
means that the body range of one day will never be more than two
times the body range of the other day.
Bearish Side-by-Side Black Lines
What the length and body length requirements described in the two
paragraphs above are trying to avoid is having dojis or stars or short
days for the second and third days of the pattern. These types of days
would be more consistent with a reversal pattern.
Finally, the high-low ranges and the body ranges of the second and

Commentary
This is a simplistic pattern, quite similar to the Upside and Downside
Tasuki Gaps, that occurs in a strong, trending market. A gap appears
between two candlesticks of the sample color (Figures 4-40 and
4-41). This color should reflect the trend of the market. The third day
opens within the body of the second candlestick and then closes
within the body of the first candlestick (bridging the first and second
candles), which would also make it the opposite color of the first two
days. This would, in traditional terminology, close the gap.
Rules of Recognition
1. A trend continues, with two long days that have a gap
between them.

Chapter Four
2. The third day fills the gap and is the opposite color of the
first two days.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
The market is moving strongly in one direction. This move is
extended further by another day that gaps even more in the direction
of the trend. The third day opens well into the body of the second
day, then completely fills the gap. This gap-closing move should be
looked upon as supporting for the current trend. Gaps normally
provide excellent support and/or resistance points when considered
after a reasonable period of time. Because this gap is filled within
one day, some other considerations should be made. If this is the
first gap of a move, then the reaction (third day) can be considered
as profit taking.
Pattern Flexibility
No significant flexibility is suggested, as this is a fairly simple concept
and pattern. The first day could be opposite in color to the second
day without much change in the pattern’s interpretation.
Pattern Breakdown
The bullish Upside Gap Three Methods pattern reduces to a Shoot-
ing Star line (Figure 4-42) and the bearish Downside Gap Three
Methods pattern reduces to a Hammer line (Figure 4-43). These
are two patterns (when all are considered) that do not reduce to
the single line that supports the bullish or bearish nature of the
pattern.

Commentary
The bullish Rest after Battle pattern is a three-day bullish continua-
tion pattern. It was created to capture that certain type of uptrend
that begins with one long white day, followed by a number of days of
lateral movement, followed by another long white day, to be fol-
lowed again by a number of days of lateral movement. This type of
“stair step” uptrend can last anywhere from three to eight weeks. At
some point, the momentum of the uptrend increases, and you will see
consecutive white days, gap up openings, and fewer consecutive
black days, until the uptrend finally becomes overextended.
The Rest after Battle pattern has no opposite/complementary
pattern.
Rules of Recognition
1. The Rest after Battle pattern starts with a long white day.
The midpoint of the range of the first day is above a 10-
period moving average. This means that an uptrend has
been in place.

2. The high-low range of the first day should be greater than
the average of the five days’ high-low ranges that immedi-
ately precede the pattern.
3. The first day must also have a very long body.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
The first day of this pattern represents real buying enthusiasm. You
don’t want too much buying to precede this first day, so the day
before the pattern cannot be a white day that is longer than the first
day of the pattern.
Additionally, beware of this pattern if it occurs after a sustained
uptrend.
Pattern Flexibility
The second and third candlestick lines in this pattern represent a
period of rest following the first day’s strong rise. The second and
third days are relatively short, and they do not have long bodies.
Specifically, the high-low ranges of the second and third days must be
less than 75% of the high-low range of the first day. And the real
bodies of the second and third days must occupy less than 50% of the
days’ high-low ranges.
The second and third days are meant to represent rest, not weakness
or too much additional strength following the first day. So, the second
and third days must both close above the midpoint of the first day’s
high-low range. Additionally, the third day’s low must be greater than
the midpoint of the first day’s high-low range. These requirements
make sure that prices do not decline too much after the first day.
In order to make sure that there is some, but not too much,

Continuation Patterns
strength following the first day, you should ensure that the top of the
second day is above the close of the first day. The second day can be
white or black, so the top of the second day can be the open or the
close of the second day. In either case, the gap up opening of the sec-
ond day shows there is some early additional buying interest after the
first day. To limit the strength of the second day, you should ensure
that the low of the second day is below the high of the first day.
Again, following through with the not too much weakness or
strength idea, the third day must open and close below the second
day’s high, and open and close above the second day’s low. Like the
second day, the third day can be either white or black.
Pattern Breakdown
The Rest after Battle pattern reduces to a long white candlestick line
with a fairly long white body at the lower end. A long white candle-
stick line that occurs in an uptrend is bullish and supports the bull-
ishness of the pattern.

Chapter Four
Commentary
The Three Methods (Chapter 5) include the bullish Rising Three
Methods and the bearish Falling Three Methods. Both are continua-
tion patterns that represent breaks in the trend of prices without
causing a reversal. They are days of rest in the market action and can
be used to add to positions, if already in the market.
Rising Three Method
A long white candlestick is formed in an uptrend (Figure 4-48). After
this long day, a group of small-bodied candlesticks occur, which
shows some resistance to the previous trend. These reaction days are
generally black, but most importantly, their bodies all fall within the
high-low range of the first long white day. Remember that the high-
low range includes the shadows. The final candlestick (normally the
fifth day) opens above the close of the previous reaction day and then
closes at a new high.
Falling Three Methods
The Falling Three Methods pattern is the bearish counterpart of the
Rising Three Methods pattern. A downtrend is underway, when it is
further perpetuated with a long black candlestick (Figure 4-49). The
next three days produce small-body days that move against the trend.
It is best if the bodies of these reactionary days are white. It is noted
that the bodies all remain within the high-low range of the first black
candlestick. The last day should open near the previous day’s close
and then close at a new low. The market’s rest is over.
Rules of Recognition
1. A long candlestick is formed representing the current
trend.

2. This candlestick is followed by a group of small real
body candlesticks. It is best if they are opposite in
color.
3. The small candlesticks rise or fall opposite to the trend and
remain within the high-low range of the first day.
4. The final day should be a strong day, with a close outside
of the first day’s close and in the direction of the original
trend.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
The concept behind the Rising Three Methods comes from early
Japanese futures trading history and is a vital part of the Sakata
Method. The Three Methods pattern is considered a rest from bat-
tle. In modern terminology, the market is just taking a break. The
psychology behind a move like this is that some doubt creeps in
about the ability of the trend to continue. This doubt increases as
the small-range reaction days take place. However, once the bulls see
that a new low cannot be made, the bullishness is resumed and new
highs are set quickly. The falling Three Methods pattern is just the
opposite.
Pattern Flexibility
Because this pattern normally consists of five candle lines, it is some-
what rare to find in its classic form. Some leeway can be allowed
in the range of the reaction days. They may go slightly above or
below the range of the first day. It is best, if this is allowed, that
they cover the range of the first day completely. If they do not and
tend in one direction, the pattern can become a Mat Hold pattern,
if it occurs in an uptrend.

the range of the first white day. Seeing the two patterns side-by-side
will show that the uptrend was, and is, much stronger for the bullish
Mat Hold pattern.

Commentary
Bullish Mat Hold
The bullish Mat Hold pattern is a modified version of the Rising
Three Methods. The first three days start out like the Upside Gap
Two Crows, with the exception that the second black body (third
day) dips into the body of the first long white day (Figure 4-53). This
is followed by another small black body that closes even lower, but
still within the range of the first white body. The fifth day sees a large
gap opening, with a strong rise to a close above the high of the high-
est of the three black days. This suggests that the trend will continue
upward and that new positions can be taken here.
The bullish Mat Hold Pattern shows greater strength as a contin-
uation signal than the Rising Three Methods. The reaction days are
basically higher than the ones in the Rising Three Methods. In other
words, the bullish Mat Hold does not take quite the rest, or break
from trend, that the Rising Three methods does.

Bearish Mat Hold
The bearish Mat Hold pattern (Figure 4-54) is a five-day bearish con-
tinuation pattern. It intends to capture the normal breaks or pauses
that occur when a market is trending.
Rules of Recognition
Bullish Mat Hold
1. A long white day is formed in an uptrending market.
2. A gap up with a lower close on the second day forms
almost a starlike day.
3. The following two days are reaction days similar to the Ris-
ing Three Methods.
4. The fifth day is a white day with a new closing high.
Bearish Mat Hold
1. The pattern begins with a long black day that occurs during
a downtrend.
2. The next day is a white day whose real body gaps away
from the prior day’s black real body.
3. Two relatively short days follow, with each making a higher
top and bottom than the preceding day.
4. The fifth day is a long black day that opens below the close
of the fourth day and then closes below the open of the sec-
ond day.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
Bullish Mat Hold
The market is continuing its rise, with a long white day confirming
the bullish action. The next day prices gap open and trade in a small

Chapter Four
range, only to close slightly lower. This lower close (lower than the
open) is still a new closing high for the move. The bulls have only
rested, even though the price action surely brings out the bears. The
next couple of days cause some concern that the upward move may
be in jeopardy. These days open about where the market closed on
the previous day and then close slightly lower. Even by the third such
day, the market is still higher than the open of the first day (a long
white day). An attitude that a reversal has failed develops and prices
rise again to close at a new closing high. This fully supports the bulls’
case that this was just a pause in a strong upward trend.
Bearish Mat Hold
Days two, three, and four are the break in the trend, and you will
notice that they never close above the open of the first day. So, by the
end of day four, traders are beginning to think that any reversal of the
downtrend has failed. When the fifth day closes below the open of
the second day, the bears know that the prior three days were just a
pause in a strong downward trend.
Pattern Flexibility
The second, third, and fourth days of the pattern do not have any
length of body requirements, so one or more of these days are com-
monly dojis. Additionally, the third and fourth days are permitted to
be either white or black. Although white is preferred for both days,
the fourth day is often black.
The first and fifth days must have long bodies. The body of a can-
dlestick is the part between the open and the close. A long body is a
body that occupies more than 50% of the high-low range.
The arrangement of the three small black days should show con-
secutive declines, much like the Rising Three Methods. The reaction
days are altogether higher than those in the Rising Three Methods.

Rising Three Methods is a more rigid pattern. Even though this pat-
tern begins somewhat like the Upside Gap Two Crows, the closing of
the third day into the body of the first day eliminates that possibility.
One must also be on guard for a possible Three Black Crows pattern
starting with the second day, especially if it is a long day.
The bearish Mat Hold pattern is similar to the Falling Three Meth-
ods pattern.

Commentary
This is a four-line pattern that appears in a defined trend. It can be
looked upon as an extended version of either the Three Black Crows
pattern (bearish) or the Three White Soldiers pattern (bullish). This
pattern is a resting or pausing pattern: the rest is accomplished in

only one day. Breaks in trend are almost always healthy for the trend.
Some Japanese literature refers to this pattern as the Fooling Three
Crows for the bearish version. The bullish case could also be called
Fooling Three Soldiers.
Bullish Three-Line Strike
Three white days with consecutively higher highs are followed by a
long black day (Figure 4-59). This long black day opens at a new
high and then plummets to a lower low than the first white day of the
pattern. This type of action completely erases the previous three-day
upward march. If the previous trend was strong, this should be
looked upon as just a setback with some profit taking. This last day
is considered a liquidating day, which will give the upward trend
needed strength.
Bearish Three-Line Strike
A downtrend is accentuated by three black days that each have con-
secutively lower lows (Figure 4-60). The fourth day opens at a new
low, then rallies to close above the high of the first black day. This
last long white day completely negated the previous three black days.
This day should be looked upon as a day when shorts were being
covered, and the down move should continue.
Rules of Recognition
Bullish Three-Line Strike
1. Three days resembling Three White Soldiers are continuing
an uptrend.
2. A higher open on the fourth day drops to close below the
open of the first white day.

Chapter Four
Bearish Three-Line Strike
1. Three days resembling Three Black Crows are continuing a
downtrend.
2. A lower open on the fourth day rallies to close above the
open of the first black day.
Scenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern
The market has continued in its trend, aided by the recent Three
Black Crows or Three White Soldiers pattern, as the case may be.
The fourth day opens in the direction of the trend, but profit taking
or short covering causes the market to move strongly in the opposite
direction. This action causes considerable soul searching, but remem-
ber that this move completely eradicated the previous three days.
This surely dried up the short-term reversal sentiment and the trend
should continue in its previous direction.
Pattern Flexibility
The amount of the initial gap in the direction of trend and the
amount that the fourth day moved would be strong indication of the
success of this pattern as a continuation pattern.
Pattern Breakdown
The bullish Three-Line Strike pattern reduces to a Shooting Star
line and is in direct conflict with the bullishness of this pattern (Fig-
ure 4-61). The bearish Three-Line Strike pattern reduces to a Ham-
mer and is also in direct conflict with this pattern’s bearishness
(Figure 4-62).

CHAPTER FIVE
Sakata’s Method and
Candle Formations
Japanese history, and Japanese financial trading history, in particular,
is rich with accounts of success, usually dominated by only a few
individuals. One such success was a man named Munehisa (Sohkyu)
Honma. Some references use Sohkyu and some use Munehisa.
Honma stepped into Japanese futures trading history in the mid-
eighteenth century. When Honma was given control of the wealthy
family business in 1750, he began trading at the local rice ex-
change in the port city of Sakata in Dewa Province, now Yamagata
Prefecture, on the west coast of northern Honshu (about 220 miles
north of Tokyo). Sakata was a collection and distribution port for
rice and today is still one of the most important ports on the Sea of
Japan.
Stories have it that Honma established a personal communications
network that consisted of men on rooftops spaced every four kilome-
ters from Osaka to Sakata. The distance between Osaka and Sakata
is about 380 miles, which would have required well over 100 men.

(cid:2) 282
Chapter Five
This allowed Honma the edge he needed to accumulate great wealth
in rice trading.
Honma kept many records in order to learn about the psychology
of investors. His studies helped him understand that the initial entry
into a trade must not be rushed. According to Honma, if you feel
compelled to rush into a trade because you believe that you just can’t
lose, wait three days to see if you still feel the same way. If you do,
you can enter the trade, probably quite successfully.
The Honma Family owned a great rice field near Sakata and they
were considered extremely wealthy in both fact and song. One folk
song said that no man can be as wealthy as a Honma: one can merely
hope to be as rich as a daimyo. A daimyo is the early Japanese term
for a feudal lord.
Honma died in 1803. During this period of time a book was pub-
lished. “If all other people are bullish, be foolish and sell rice” is
some of the advice contained in San-en Kinsen Horoku. This book
was published in 1755 and is known today as the basis of Japan’s
market philosophy. Today, in Sakata, a house that once belonged to
the Honma family is the Honma Museum of Art.
All of the patterns and formations based upon Sakata’s Method are
taken from 160 rules that Honma wrote when he was 51 years old.
Sakata’s Method, in turn, is what is now considered the beginnings of
candle pattern recognition. Candlestick charting was not actually
developed by Honma, only the pattern philosophy that goes with it.
His approach has been credited as the origin of current candlestick
analysis.
Since Honma came from Sakata, you may see reference to Sakata’s
Law, the Sakata Method, Sakata’s Five Methods, Honma Constitu-
tion, and similar names. While the labels may differ, the analysis
technique remains the same. This book will refer to this approach as
Sakata’s Method.

Sakata’s Method and Candle Formations
SAKATA’S METHOD
Sakata’s Method, as originated and used by Honma for basic chart
analysis, deals with the basic yin (inn) and yang (yoh) candle line
along with two additional lines. The concept is centered around the
number 3. The number 3 appears often in traditional analysis as well
as in Japanese charting techniques. Sakata’s Method is a technique of
chart analysis using the number 3 at different points and times in the
market. Sakata’s Method can be summarized as:
San-zan (Three Mountains)
San-sen (Three Rivers)
San-ku (Three Gaps)
San-pei (Three Soldiers)
San-poh (Three Methods)
From this list it is should be obvious that san refers to the ubiqui-
tous number 3.
SAN-ZAN(THREE MOUNTAINS)
Three Mountains forms a line that makes a major top in the market.
This is similar to the traditional Western triple-top formation in
which the price rises and falls three times, forming a top. This forma-
tion is also similar to the Three Buddha Top (san-son) formation,
which is the equivalent of the traditional head and shoulders forma-
tion. It comes from the positioning of three Buddhist images lined up,
with a large Buddha in the center and a smaller one on each side. San-
zan also includes the typical Western triple top where three upmoves

are made with comparable corrections that follow. The three tops
may be the same height or may be trending in one direction, most
probably down.
SAN-SEN(THREE RIVERS)
Three Rivers is the opposite of Three Mountains. It is often used like
the traditional triple bottom or inverted head and shoulders bottom,
but this not necessarily correct. The Three Rivers method is based on
the theory of using three lines to forecast the turning point of the
market. This can be seen in a number of bullish candle patterns using
three lines, such as the Morning Star and Three White Soldiers. In
Japanese literature, the Morning Star is often called the Three Rivers
Morning Star in reference to this Sakata Method.

There is some confusion about whether Sakata’s Method uses
Three Rivers for a bottom formation technique or whether it refers
to the use of three lines for identifying tops and bottoms. There
is considerable reference in Japanese literature to Three Rivers
Evening Stars (a bearish pattern) and the Three Rivers Upside Gap
Two Crows (also a bearish pattern). Also recall from Chapter 3 that
there was a bullish reversal pattern called the Unique Three Rivers
Bottom.
SAN-KU(THREE GAPS)
This method uses gaps in price action as a means to time entry and
exit points in the market. The saying goes that after a market bottom,

sell on the third gap. The first gap (ku) demonstrates the appearance
of new buying with great force. The second gap represents additional
buying and possibly some covering by the sophisticated bears. The
third gap is the result of short covering by the reluctant bears and any
delayed market orders for buying. Here, on the third gap, Sakata’s
Method recommends selling because of the conflict of orders and the
possibility of reaching overbought conditions too soon. This same
technique works in reverse for a downward gap in the market after a
top. The Japanese term for filling a gap is anaume.Gaps (ku) are also
called windows (mado) by the Japanese.
SAN-PEI(THREE SOLDIERS)
San-pei means “three soldiers who are marching in the same direc-
tion.” This is typified by the bullish Three White Soldiers candle pat-
tern, which indicates a steady rise in the market. This steady type of
price rise shows promise as a major move to the upside. Sakata’s
Method also shows how this pattern deteriorates and shows weak-
ness in the market rise. These bearish variations to the bullish Three
White Soldiers pattern are discussed next. The first variation of the
Three White Soldiers pattern is the Advanced Block pattern, which is
quite similar, except that the second and third white days have long
upper shadows. The second variation of the Three White Soldiers
pattern is the Deliberation (stalled) pattern, which also has a long
upper shadow on the second day. However, the third day is a Spin-
ning Top, and most likely a star. This suggests that a turnaround in
the market is near.
Other patterns that make the san-pei method are the Three Black
Crows and the Identical Three Crows pattern. Each of these candle
patterns is bearish and indicates a weak market (Chapter 3).

Chapter Five
SAN-PON(THREE METHODS)
San-poh means “a rest or cease-fire in market action.” A popular
saying “Buy, sell, and rest.” Most traditional books on market psy-
chology and trading suggest taking a break from the markets. This is
necessary for many reasons, not the least of which is to get a perspec-
tive on the market while not having any money involved. San-poh
involves the continuation patterns called the Rising Three methods
and the Falling Three Methods (Chapter 4). Some sources also refer
to two other patterns, the Upside Gap Three Methods and Downside
Gap Three Methods, all discussed in Chapter 4.
The Rising and Falling Three Methods continuation patterns are
resting patterns. The trend of the market is not broken, only pausing
while preparing for another advance or decline.
Sakata’s Method is intended to present a clear and confident way
of looking at charts. Often Sakata’s Method is presented along with
the following simple philosophy.
1. In an up or down market, prices will continue to move in
the established direction. This fact was instrumental in the
development of candle pattern identification with a com-
puter (Chapter 6).
2. It takes more force to cause a market to rise that to cause it
to fall. This is related directly to the traditional saying that
a market can fall due to its own weight.
3. A market that has risen will eventually fall, and a market
that has fallen will eventually rise. As an article in the Sep-
tember 1991 issue of Forbes observed, in a bear market, it’s
smart to remind yourself that the world isn’t coming to an
end, and in bull market, it’s smart to remind yourself that
trees don’t grow to the sky. A similar and more common
analogy is that all good things must come to an end.

4. Market prices sometimes just stop moving completely. This
refers to lateral trading, a time for all but the most nimble
traders to stand aside.
Sakata’s Method, while focusing on the number 3, also involves the
use of broader formations in which numerous candle patterns may
exist.
CANDLE FORMATIONS
There are many Japanese candle formations that resemble price for-
mations used in traditional technical analysis. Steve Nison coined
many of the names commonly used in the West today. These forma-
tions can consist of many days of data. These formations are used as
general market indicators and lack the precise timing that many
investors and traders require. When a formation does evolve, look
for additional evidence of price reversal, such as a reversal candle
pattern. Some interference may occur when a formation takes shape
over a long period of time. Remember that most candle patterns, and
certainly almost all reversal candle patterns, require that they have a
relationship with the current or previous trend. These trends are
greatly influenced by the following candle formations.
EIGHT NEW PRICE LINES (SHINNE HATTE)
This is a formation of continually rising prices in the market. After
eight new price highs are set, one should take profits, or at least pro-
tect positions with stops. Action based on 10 new price highs, 12 new
price highs, and 13 new price highs is also mentioned in some litera-

ture, but not recommended here. The previous market action should
be taken into consideration before using this technique.
TWEEZERS (KENUKI)
Tweezers is a relatively simple formation using the components of
two or more daily candle lines to determine tops and bottoms. If the
high of two days is equal, the formation is called a Tweezer Top
(kenukitenjo). Likewise, if the low of two days is equal, it is called a
Tweezer Bottom (kenukizoko). The high or low of these days may
also coincide with the open or close. This means that one day could
have a long upper shadow and the next day could be an Opening
Marubozu with the open (also the high) equal to the high of the pre-
vious day. The Tweezer Top or Tweezer Bottom is not limited to just

Chapter Five
two days. Days of erratic movement could occur between the two
days that make up the tweezer formation.
Tweezer Tops and Tweezer Bottoms are formations that will give
short-term support and resistance. The terms support and resistance
refer to prices that have previously turned the market. Support is a
price base that stops market declines, and resistance is a level of
prices that usually halts market rises. A good indication that Tweezer
Tops and Tweezer Bottoms have succeeded occurs when they are also
part of a reversal pattern. An example of this would be a Harami
Cross in which the two highs (or lows) are equal.
Similar in concept to the Tweezers is the Matching Low and Stick
Sandwich patterns discussed in Chapter 3. These two bullish reversal
patterns are derivatives of the tweezer concept, except that the close

price is used exclusively, whereas the Tweezer may use any data com-
ponent, such as high or low.
HIGH WAVES (TUKANE NOCHIAL)
The High Waves formation can be seen in the upper shadows on a
series of candle lines. After an uptrend, a series of days such as a
Shooting Star, Spinning Tops, or Gravestone Doji can produce top-
ping tendencies. This failure to close higher shows a loss of direction
and can indicate a reversal in market direction. An Advance Block
pattern could also be the beginning of a High Waves formation.

Chapter Five
TOWER TOP AND TOWER BOTTOM (OHTENJYOU)
Tower Tops and Tower Bottoms are made by long days that slowly
change color and indicate a possible reversal. Tower Bottoms occur
when the market is in a downtrend, along with many long black days,
but not necessarily setting significantly lower prices as in the Three
Black Crows pattern. These long black days eventually become white
days, and even though a turnaround isn’t obvious, new closing highs
are eventually made. There is nothing to say that an occasional short
day cannot be part of this reversal pattern. These short days usually
happen during the transition from black o white days. Of course, the
Tower Top is the exact opposite. The term Tower refers to the long
days that help define this pattern. Some Japanese literature refers to
this type of formation as a Turret Top when it occurs at peaks.

Figure 5-13
FRY PAN BOTTOM (NABEZOKO)
The Fry Pan Bottom is similar to the Tower Bottom, except that the
days are all small or short body days. The bottom formation is
rounded and the colors are not as important. After a number of days
of slowly rounding out the bottom, a gap is made with a white day.
This confirms the reversal and an uptrend should begin. The name is
derived from the scooping bottom of a frying pan with a long handle.
Dumpling Top is the counterpart of the Fry Pan Bottom forma-
tion. It is a rounded top similar to the rounded top in traditional
technical jargon. The downtrend is confirmed by a gap to a back
body. If the black day after the gap is a Belt Hold Line, the ability of
this formation to predict future price movement is even better.

HIGH PRICE GAPPING PLAY AND LOW PRICE GAPPING
PLAY (BOHTOH AND BOHRAKU)
High and Low Price Gapping Plays are the Japanese equivalents of
breakouts. As prices begin to consolidate near a support or resistance
level, the indecision in the market becomes greater as time goes by.
Once this range is broken, market direction is quickly resumed. If the
breakout is caused by a gap in the same direction as the prices were
trending before the consolidation, a further move in that direction is
certain. Because of the subjective nature of these formations, the text-
book cases will rarely be seen. Basically, they are the same as the Ris-
ing and Falling Three Methods and the Mat Hold, except that no
clear arrangement of candlesticks can be used to define them.

The Philosophy
behind Candle
Pattern Identification
DATA REQUIREMENTS, GAPS, AND RULES
Only daily price data, which consists of open, high, low, and close
prices on a stock or commodity, is being used when explaining these
concepts. Many times, the open price is not available on stocks. In
such cases the previous day’s closing price has been substituted. The
exception to this is when the previous day’s close is higher than
today’s high, today’s high is used for the open. Similarly, when the
previous day’s close is lower than today’s low, today’s low is used as
the open price. This allows the visibility of gaps from one day’s close
to the next day’s range.
Gaps are an important part of candlestick analysis. To demon-
strate that there is not much difference, the S&P 100 stocks with and
without open price were tested and analyzed. Comprehensive testing

was also accomplished on vast amounts of data that contained the
open price to see if there was any statistical information about gaps
that could be used when the open price was not available. Whenever
a day’s high and low prices were greater than the high price of the
preceding day, a gap-up analysis was performed. Likewise, whenever
a day’s high and low price were less than the previous day’s low price,
a gap-down analysis was done. Once a “gap day” was identified, the
following formula was used to determine the location of the open
price relative to the day’s range.
[(Open − Low) / (High − Low)] * 100
The results showed consistency that the open price was 17% to
31% into the high-low range following a gap. If the gap was to the
upside, the open price would fall about 17 to 28 percent above the
low price. Similarly, if the gap was to the downside, the open price
would fall 17 to 31 percent below the high price. Remember, these
are just statistics calculated from a large amount of data, so the usual
precautions are suggested.
One must also be aware that certain candle patterns cannot exist if
there is no open price. That is, the previous day’s close cannot be sub-
stituted for the open. The following candle patterns cannot exist
when the open price is not available. This was first written in 1992
when opening price data was not readily available. Since then most
data services provide opening prices on all stocks. Coincidentally or
not, most of these services started providing open prices in the 1991
time frame.

There are techniques that can be used in computerized candle pat-
tern identification that will still allow these patterns to be used. For
example, one could set some parameters that relate the data compo-
nents from “greater than” to “greater than or equal to.” As a result
a requirement that the open of one day should be less than the close
of the previous day could be modified so that the open could also be
equal. Although this may stretch the philosophy of candle pattern
recognition too far, it at least permits the use of data that does not
contain the open price.
Today’s electronic capabilities let traders watch intraday price
movements from single trade ticks, one minute bars, and almost any
other conceivable increment in between. It is not the purpose here to
decide which type is better, but sometimes the trees do get in the way
of the forest. One must also keep in mind that candle patterns reflect
the short-term psychology of trading, including the decision process
that occurs after a market is closed. This is why open and close prices
are so important.
Using intraday data without the benefit of a break is questionable
at the very least.

Pattern recognition has been around for many years. A computer can
check and scan vast amounts of data and compile unlimited statistics

on patterns and their ability to forecast prices. This approach never
remains popular for very long because it is based solely on statistics
and overlooks an important explanation of why some patterns are
more successful than others—human psychology.
ENTER HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY
In the first few minutes of the trading day, a great deal of overnight
emotion is captured. Sometimes special events cause chaos. For exam-
ple, on the New York Stock Exchange, it may take several minutes for
the specialist to open a stock for trading because of a large order
imbalance. However, once a stock or commodity does open, a point
of reference has been established. From this reference point, trading
decisions are made throughout the day.
As the trading day progresses, extremes are reached as speculator
emotion is tossed around. These extremes of emotions are recorded
as the high and low of the trading day. Finally, the trading day ends
and the last trade is recorded as the closing price. This is the price
that many will use to help make decisions about their positions and
the tactics they will use at the open of the next trading day.
Aside from intraday data, four prices are normally available for
the trader to analyze. One certainly knows the exact open and close
prices for any trading day, but at what times during the day the high
and low were reached, and in what order, are not known.
How does one determine the existence of a candlestick pattern?
Most candle patterns require the identification of not only the
data relationship making the pattern, but also the trend immediately
preceding the pattern. The trend is what sets up the psychology of
traders for the candle pattern to develop. Most of the current litera-
ture somehow evades this essential ingredient to candle pattern
recognition.

It must also be stated here that Japanese candlestick analysis is
short-term (one to seven days) analysis. Any patterns that give
longer-term results are surely just coincidental.
TREND DETERMINATION
What is a trend? This question, if it could be answered in depth,
could reveal the secrets of the marketplace. For this discussion, only
a simple and highly reliable short-term answer is sought.
Trend analysis is a primary part of technical analysis. To some,
trend identification is as important as the timing of reversal points in
the market. Technical analysis books deal with the subject of trend
quite thoroughly and define it in numerous ways. One of the most
common approaches is the moving average.
Moving Averages and Smoothing
One of the simplest market systems created, the moving average,
works almost as well as the best of the complicated smoothing tech-
niques. A moving average is exactly the same as a regular average
except that it “moves” because it is continuously updated as new
data becomes available. Each data point in a moving average is given
equal weight in the computation, hence the term arithmetic or simple
is sometimes used when referring to a moving average.
A moving average smooths a sequence of numbers so that the
effects of short-term fluctuations are reduced, while those of longer-
term fluctuations remain relatively unchanged. Obviously, the time
span of the moving average will alter its characteristics.
J.M. Hurst in The Profit Magic of Stock Transaction Timing(1970)
explained these alterations with three general rules:



==================================================
                     PAGE 336                     
==================================================

307 (cid:2)
The Philosophy behind Candle Pattern identification
1. A moving average of any given time span exactly reduces
the magnitude of the fluctuations of durations equal to that
time span to zero.
2. The same moving average also greatly reduces (but does not
eliminate) the magnitude of all fluctuations of duration less
than the time span of the moving average.
3. All fluctuations greater than the time span of the average
“come through,” or are present in the resulting moving
average line. Those with durations just a little greater
than the span of the average are greatly reduced in
magnitude, but the effect lessens as periodicity duration
increases. Very long duration periodicities come through
nearly unscathed.
A somewhat more advanced smoothing technique is the exponen-
tial moving average. In principle, it accomplished the same thing as
the simple (arithmetic) moving average. Exponential smoothing was
developed to assist in radar tracking and flight path projection. A
quicker projection of trend was needed with more influence from the
most recent data. The formula for exponential smoothing appears
complex, but is only another way of weighting the data components
so that the most recent data receives the greatest weight. Even though
only two data points are required to get exponentially smoothed
value, the more data used the better. All of the data is used and is a
part of the new results.
A simple explanation of exponential smoothing is therefore given
here. An exponential average utilizes a smoothing constant that
approximates the number of days for a simple moving average. This
constant is multiplied by the difference between today’s closing price
and the previous day’s moving average value. This new value is then
added to the previous day’s moving average value. The smoothing

Chapter Six
constant is equivalent to 2/(n+1) where nis the number of days used
for a simple moving average.
The Trend Method Used
After conducting numerous tests, a short-term exponential smooth-
ing of the data was determined to best identify the short-term trend.
It gives the best, easiest, and quickest determination of the short-term
trend and is certainly a concept that one can understand. Simple con-
cepts are usually more reliable and certainly more creditable.
Numerous tests were performed on vast amounts of data with the
finding that the exponential period of 10 days seemed to work as
well as any, especially when you recall that candlesticks have a short-
term orientation.
IDENTIFYING THE CANDLE PATTERNS
Previous chapters presented detailed descriptions of the exact rela-
tionships among the open, high, low, and close. Those chapters
deal with the concept of trend use, while this chapter focuses on
trend determination. In addition, a method of determining long
days, short days, doji days, etc. is needed, including the relation-
ship between the body and the shadows. The latter is essential for
proper identification of patterns such as the Hanging Man and
Hammer. The following sections will show the multitude of meth-
ods used to accomplish these and similar tasks.
LONG DAYS
Any of three different methods are available, where each, or any
combination, of the three can be used to determine long days. The

The Philosophy behind Candle Pattern identification
tern minimum in these formulas refers to the minimum acceptable
percentage for a long day. Any day whose body is greater than this
minimum value will be considered a long day.
1. Long Body / Price − Minimum (0 to 100%)
This method will relate the day in question with the actual value of
the price for a stock or commodity. If the value is set at 5% and the
price is at 100, then a long day will be any whose range from open to
close is 5 points or more. This method does not use any past data to
determine a long day.
2. Long Body / High to Low Range − Minimum (0 to 100%)
This method uses the body length in relation to the high-low range
for a given day under this technique. If a candle does not have long
shadows, it is considered a long day. Used by itself, this is not the best
method; used in conjunction with one or both of the other methods,
it is good. This method will eliminate days that might appear more as
Spinning Tops when viewed with the surrounding data.
3. Long Body / Average Body of Last X Days
− Minimum (0 to 100%)
An average of the body sizes of the last Xdays is used to determine
a long body. The value for X should be anywhere between 5 and 10
days. If the percentage was set to 130, then a long day would be iden-
tified if it was 30% greater than this average. This method is good
because it falls in line with the general concept of candlesticks and
their use for short-term analysis.

SHORT DAYS
The exact same concept for determining long days is used for short
days with one exception; instead of minimum percentages, maximum
percentages are used in the three formulas.
Small Body / Large Body Relationship
The Engulfing Pattern and Harami use both a large body and a small
body for their patterns. This large body and small body concept is not
the same as the long and short body concept discussed previously. Here
the large and small bodies refer only to their relationship with one
another. One must decide how much engulfing constitutes an Engulfing
Pattern. If the concept is held to the letter of the law, then only one tick
or minimum price movement is required to cause an engulfment. Can
this be at just one end of the body when the prices are equal at the other
end? In other words, can the open-to-close range be different by only
one tick? The following formula will let you control this situation.
Small Body / Large Body − Maximum (0 to 100%)
This inverse of this value can be used for the Harami. It is recom-
mended to use values that represent what could easily be identified if
the determination were made visually. If a small body is engulfed by
a large body by 70%, it means that the small body cannot exceed
70% of the size of the large body. Said another way, the large body is
approximately 30% large than the small body.
UMBRELLA DAYS
Remember, an umbrella day occurs when the body is at the upper end
of the day’s range and the lower shadow is considerably longer than

The Philosophy behind Candle Pattern identification
the body. One must also take into consideration the length of the
upper shadow, if one exists. The body and lower shadow relationship
is defined as a percentage of the body length to lower shadow length.
Umbrella Body / Lower Shadow (0 to 100%)
If this value is set to 50, then the body cannot exceed 50% of the
size of the lower shadow. In this example, the lower shadow would
be at least twice the length of the body. The upper shadow on an
umbrella day can be handled in a similar fashion, such as:
Umbrella Upper Shadow / High to Low Range (0 to 100%)
The upper shadow is related to the entire day’s range. A value of
10 means that the upper shadow is only 10% (or less) of the high-low
range. These variables will help identify the Hanging Man and Ham-
mer candle patterns. Patterns such as the shooting Star and Inverted
Hammer use just the inverse of these settings.
DOJI DAYS
Doji occurs when the open and close prices are equal. This is an excep-
tionally restrictive rule for most types of data and should have some
leeway when identifying candle patterns. The formula lets you set a
percentage difference between the two prices that will be acceptable.
Doji Body / High to Low Range − Maximum (0 to 100%)
This value is a percentage maximum of the prices relative to the
range of prices on the Doji day. A value in the neighborhood of 1 to
3% seems to work quite well.

Chapter Six
EQUAL VALUES
Equal values occur when prices are required to be equal. This is used
for patterns like Meeting Lines and Separating Lines. Meeting Lines
require that the close price of each day be equal; while Separating
Lines require the open prices to be equal. The same concept used in
determining a Doji day can be used here as well. There are a few
instances when setting the parameters to the literal definition will
restrict, rather than enhance, the pattern concept.
COMPUTERIZED ANALYSIS AND ANOMALIES
The candle pattern statistics in Table 6-1 shows the amount of data
used in this analysis, the type of data used, and various other perti-
nent statistics. All common stocks on the New York Stock Exchange,
the Nasdaq market, and the American Stock Exchange were used
over a 13-year period. Using stock data prior to late 1991 would dis-
tort the analysis because most data services did not provide open
prices then. Any discrepancies in the summary statistics are because
not all of those stocks traded for the full analysis period.
A total pattern frequency of slightly more than 11% equates to
one candle pattern about every 9 trading days, 8.69 to be exact. This
represents a good frequency for daily analysis of stocks and futures.
Reversal patterns occur about 40 more times often than continuation
patterns. This too is important, as it indicates the reversal of a trend
caused by changed positions in trading. In this analysis, there were
65 reversal patterns and 23 continuation patterns, which make rever-
sal patterns account for about 74% of all patterns.
It is also interesting to note that only five patterns account for
about 6.7% of all patterns. Of this, the Harami pattern accounts for
46% of those five patterns and over 3% of all patterns. Also, please

note that some patterns occur quite infrequently. To assess whether
or not they have any value, you should refer to the ranking statistics
in Chapter 7. When a pattern occurs, you must understand that, sta-
tistically, the success or failure does not mean much. Success and/or
failure of candle patterns is dealt with extensively in Chapter 7.
When a particular pattern appears only a few times in a large
amount of data, you should realize that its success and/or failure is

subject to the time period under study. Do not let statistics interfere
with common sense, and certainly be alert for inaccuracies in the
data. The number of occurrences gives confidence in the average
value obtained. When dealing with small samples of data, it is how
the individual values are distributed that is important. For example,
if you had only 12 samples and they were all winners, you would be
more interested than if there were only 5 or 6 winners.
Remember, candle patterns were used as a visual charting tech-
nique for hundreds of years. With computers there is no way to han-
dle the subjectivity that classic chart reading offers. Another factor to
consider when using computers is the quality of the graphics screen:
its resolution. The screen consists of small dots of light known as
pixel elements. If too much data is used, or if the range of the data is
too great, then what might appear as equal on the screen would not
be so numerically. The smallest size (width) horizontal line could
have a price range within itself, not visible to the eye. Not only com-
puter screens, but also computer-generated chart books could have
this problem. This is why some flexibility must be built into the iden-
tification of, and definition of, the classic patterns.
Another computer anomaly arises in handling candle patterns that
are within, or part of, another candle pattern. A computer will look
at the data in chronological order, that is, old data first. As each day
is added, a candle pattern may or may not be noted. When a pattern
is identified, the results are stored and the process continues. If a bull-
ish Engulfing Day is identified and the next day has a white body
with a close greater than the first day of the Engulfing Day, a Three
Outside Up pattern is noted and recorded. The data for statistics and
testing has been acquired for both patterns. However, only the Three
Outside Up pattern will be identified as a candle pattern if it is given
higher priority.

CHAPTER SEVEN
Reliability of Pattern
Recognition
Using the identification philosophy developed in the previous chap-
ter, one can now adapt a method of determining just how successful
candle patterns are.
MEASURES OF SUCCESS
The following three assumptions were used in measuring the success
and/or failure of the many different candle patterns:
1. The pattern must, of course, be identified based upon its
open, high, low, and close relationships.
2. For the pattern to be identified, the trend must be deter-
mined. This is interchangeable with the previous assump-
tion; each must exist in the methodology.
3. Some basis of measurement must be established to deter-
mine the success or failure of the candle pattern.

Chapter Seven
To make a credible prediction, you either know the current trend
or you do not. Both assumptions and possibilities have been used
here.
The Trend Is Known
Candle patterns fall into two general categories: those that indi-
cate a reversal of the current trend and those that indicate trend
continuation.
Each day (for each security), a prediction is made about whether
the known trend will continue or reverse for each prediction interval.
In other words, if today’s close is above the exponential average
(trend), then we assume that we are in an uptrend. The success or
failure is measured by the change in this trend over the prediction
interval. The prediction interval is the number of days into the future
the success or failure was based upon. Prediction intervals refer to the
time periods between the actual candle pattern and some point in the
future. All of the analysis in this book uses daily data (versus weekly
or intraday data) for the time intervals.
When a candle pattern occurs, it is offering a short-term forecast
on the direction of the underlying market. The prediction interval is
the number of days after the candle pattern that a determination is
made as to whether or not the candle pattern was successful. A pre-
diction interval is a time in the future that measures the candle pat-
tern’s forecasting ability.
Once a trend starts, the odds are that it will continue. Every stu-
dent of science or engineering will recognize that this is nothing more
than Newton’s First Law of Motion, which says, every body contin-
ues in a state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless it
is compelled to change that state by forces applied to it. Simply said,
it is easier for a market to continue its direction than to reverse its
direction.

Reliability of Pattern Recognition
Therefore, the continuation of a trend is more common than the
reversal of a trend. Remember, we are talking about the short-term
future here.
If, at the prediction interval, the price is still above the trend, then
the candle pattern was successful. Simply said: if, during the predic-
tion interval, we are still in an uptrend, then it was deemed success-
ful (Figure 7-1). If not, it was a failure. Figure 7-1 graphically shows
the relationship of reversal and continuation patterns with the pre-
diction interval. The relationship of pattern type with prediction
interval is based upon the fact that the trend is known.
The Trend Is Not Known

Chapter Seven
Sometimes you do not know what the trend is before making the pre-
diction. In such cases, a coin-toss type of prediction is made about
whether the price will go up or down. If you do not know the trend,
the odds of its continuing or reversing would fall into the area of
50%. The difference above or below 50% would reflect the direc-
tional bias of the data used in the analysis. Again, the success or fail-
ure is based upon the price at the prediction interval relative to the
change in trend. This fact is also shown in Figure 7-1. Remember,
most candle patterns require that the trend be identified.
Reverse Current Trend and Continue Current Trend
From the computer calculations, two primary parameters are deter-
mined: Reverse Current Trend and Continue Current Trend. These
are further broken down into Up and Down trends (i.e., Reverse Cur-
rent Trend Up and Reverse Current Trend Down).
The sum of Reverse Current Trend success and Continue Current
Trend success will be equal to the number of days of data used in the
testing process. Because a prediction is made each day, Reverse Cur-
rent Trend success and Continue Current Trend failure would be
equal. In other words, the success of Reverse Current Trend is also
the failure of Continue Current Trend.
Reversal candle patterns (which most are) are compared to Reverse
Current Trend and further broken down into upturns and downturns.
Because reversal candle patterns must go against the very trend that
defines them, their measure of success would not be as rigid as that of
a continuation candle pattern. In fact, their measure of success could
actually be less than that of a coin toss, since they are predicting a
change in the current trend, a trend which is supposedly known.
Likewise, continuation candle patterns are compared to Continue
Current Trend. Continuation candle patterns say that the trend that
helped define them is going to continue. Therefore, for a continuation

Reliability of Pattern Recognition
candle pattern to be considered successful, it must do better than the
success of knowing the trend in the first place. Because we know the
current trend and we know the odds are that the current trend will
continue, to be useful, continuation candle patterns must be excep-
tionally good, or they are no better than the trend-identification
process.
CANDLE PATTERN STATISTICAL RANKING
Candle patterns are predictable psychological trading pictures (win-
dows) that produce reasonable forecasting results when used in the
proper manner. This section will explain the technique used to deter-
mine the various statistics developed to show the success of candle
patterns. Note that no magnitude of success is used, only a relative
success and failure. Keep in mind, though, that success still means
that the pattern correctly predicted the market move and failure
means that it did not.
Using all of the information about pattern recognition (including
trend determination) developed in the previous chapters, we will now
set out to see just how good candle patterns are. Because a simple
approach is usually best, no elaborate assumptions were used, only
the price change over various time intervals into the future. Those
time intervals were measured in days.
Once the relative success or failure of a particular candle pattern
was determined, its relationship to the appropriate pattern standard
of measure was calculated. This standard of measure is the Reverse
Current Trend and Continue Current Trend, discussed earlier. Recall
that continuation candle patterns must outperform reversal candle
patterns because of their trend relationship. That is why you will see
many continuation candle patterns with a negative ranking, even
though their success percentage was high.

CANDLE PATTERNS RANKING ANALYSIS
While the analysis below uses adequate data, you must accept the
fact that the results will probably change over different market con-
ditions, amount of data used, and other factors that can influence
security pricing.
There are two sets of data used for the ranking analysis, the first
(short term) is data of just over two-and-one-half years in which the
market was quite volatile. The time for this analysis is from April 30,
2002 to December 31, 2004, a total of 675 market trading days. The
second analysis period (long term) was from November 29, 1991 to
December 31, 2004, a period of 3300 market trading days. Going
back further in history beyond 1991 can present some real problems
with candle pattern analysis, as most data sources do not have accu-
rate open price information. The data used for both analyses are the
2277 optionable stocks that are in the NYSE, Nasdaq, and Amex
exchanges. Optionable stocks, those that have listed options avail-
able for trading, were chosen because of their liquidity.
Shorter-Term Pattern Analysis (Apr. 30, 2002–Dec. 31, 2004)
Starting with the shorter analysis period, you can see from Figure
7-2, using the S&P 500 Index as a representative gauge that this was
a period that reflected a lot of volatility in the marketplace, along
with some good trending markets. It began with a strong declining
market, followed by a triple bottom (head and shoulders pattern),
then a good bull market ensued until early 2004. The year 2004 was
a downward biased trading range that bottomed in late summer and
rallied for the rest of the year.
The results of this analysis are presented in Tables 7-1 through
7-7. Each table shows the rankings of the patterns using a different
time period for its determination. Table 7-1 uses an interval of 1 day

for its analysis. This means that the candle pattern was determined to
be successful or not based upon the stocks’ performance one day
after the pattern was completed. There were 1,505,359 days of data
in this analysis that generated 148,984 candle patterns. This gives an
average of a candle pattern about every 10 days. Table 7-2 uses an
interval of 2 days, Table 7-3 uses an interval of 3 days, and so on.
Why was the analysis only done using intervals up to and includ-
ing 7 days in the future? It is the author’s strong opinion that candle
pattern analysis beyond that time frame is more coincidental than
predictive. Candle pattern analysis is short term in nature. Any pre-
dictive value beyond that is purely coincidental. Remember, candle
patterns are calling for a reversal or continuation of the trend. They
are not predicting how long it will last.
Table 7-1 shows the rankings for a one-day interval. In other
words, upon completion of the candle pattern, what was the stock
doing one day later. If it was above the last day of the pattern, it was
successful; if it was below the last day of the pattern, it was a failure.
The bearish Kicking pattern had a 100% success rate (%Wins), but
only had three occurrences in all of the data. Should this information
be ignored because of its infrequency? No, just the use of other analy-
sis tools to confirm it would be wise.
Out of 68 identified patterns, 28 of them were deemed to be suc-
cessful based upon the ranking (%Rank) methodology discussed in a
previous chapter. Notice that the bullish continuation (C+) pattern
(No. 12), Separating Lines, had 57% Wins and a %Rank of 10,
while the bearish reversal (R−) pattern (No. 13), Advance Block, also
had a %Rank of 10, but its %Wins was 54%. Why would one pat-
tern that is clearly better by 3% have the same rank? Because one is
a continuation pattern (Separating Lines) and is saying that the very
trend that helped to identify it is going to continue. Whereas the
reversal pattern (Advance Block) was saying that the very trend that
helped identify it is going to reverse.

Reliability of Pattern Recognition
Remember: A reversal candle pattern is saying that the very trend
that helped identify it in the first place is going to change.
From the seven tables that follow, you can see that as the predic-
tion interval increased the number of successful patterns also
increased up to an interval of five days, then dropped back some-
what. The number of successful patterns for the one-day prediction
interval was 28, whereas the number for the five-day interval was 37,
a 13% increase in successful candle patterns. This further supports
the belief by the author of the short-term nature of candle patterns.
Another valuable analysis to notice in these tables is how a partic-
ular pattern rises and falls in the rankings as the prediction interval
increases. For example, let’s use the best ranking pattern for the one-
day prediction interval, the bearish Kicking pattern. Here is how it
did over the seven rankings:
Kicking (R−)
Interval No.
1 1
2 1
3 64
4 63
5 62
6 64
7 63
This is an extreme example, but the point is clear. The bearish
Kicking pattern was accurate for the first two days, then failed for
the remainder of the analysis. Because there were only three occur-
rences, this should not be overanalyzed, but the information given
shows that it is only good for the very short term.
Now look at the bearish Separating Lines continuation pattern the
same way.

This information shows that this pattern (bearish Separating
Lines) performed well over the entire spectrum for the analysis. You
can see that Matching High and Matching Low also had similar
results, as did others.

This pattern showed improvement as the prediction interval
increased. This would mean that is was better at predicting the rever-
sal after a few days. Other patterns that follow this trend are the
bearish Deliberation and the bullish Homing Pigeon.

Reliability of Pattern Recognition
Longer-Term Pattern Analysis (Nov. 29, 1991–Dec. 31, 2004)
Continuing with the same concept in the previous section, but using
a significantly larger amount of data (almost 5.5 million days), one
can see that candle patterns tend to work well in most market envi-
ronments. Figure 7-3 is the S&P 500 Index from November 29, 1991
to December 31, 2004. During this period, the market experienced a
giant bull market, followed by a giant bear market.
Table 7-8 shows the results of the same analysis as before, only
using much more data and the inclusion of many additional candle
patterns. It is also in a more concise format. These rankings are based
upon % Wins, the percentage of the time a pattern was successful
versus being unsuccessful. The reciprocal of %Wins would be
%Losses (100 − %Wins = %Losses). Each pattern was tested over
the same prediction intervals and an average of those seven intervals
is shown in the last column.
The next two tables were created so you could answer the follow-
ing questions:
1. How well does each candle pattern perform?
2. What is the best trade exiting method or time frame for
each candle pattern?
3. When does each candle pattern perform the best?
4. When does each candle pattern perform the worst?
Trades that do not produce either a profit or a loss (i.e., the costs
of entering the trade exactly equal the proceeds from exiting the
trade) are not included in the % Wins (Table 7-8). Trades that do not
produce either a profit or loss are included in the Net Profit/Loss per
Trade (Table 7-9) calculation. The Net Profit/Loss per Trade value is
simply the average percent gain (or loss) for all trades. Because the
Net Profit/Loss per Trade value is the average result for all trades

(winning, breakeven, and losing trades), it can be a positive or nega-
tive number, or even zero. If the Net Profit/Loss per Trade value is
positive, it means the average trade produced a net profit. If the Net
Profit/Loss per Trade value is negative, it means the average trade
produced a net loss.
Note: The Net Profit/Loss per Trade value is the sum of all individ-
ual trade results divided by the number of all trades. If all trades pro-
duced either a gain or a loss (i.e., there are no 0.00 trade results), then
the Net Profit/Loss per Trade value can also be calculated as follows:
Net Profit/Loss per Trade = (% Winners × Avg Win)
+ (% Losers × Avg Loss)
Note: The equation above uses a plus sign because Avg Loss is a
negative amount. Also, if you do any of these calculations yourself,
watch out for differences caused by rounding of the % Wins and %
Losses (reciprocal of % Wins) values. For example, the table will dis-
play 71% for % Wins when 5 out of 7 trades are winning trades. A
more precise value would be 71.4286%. The program used to create
this table uses precise values in all of its calculations. The table dis-
plays the end results of its calculations as slightly rounded values for
purposes of readability.
A good candlestick pattern will have positive Net Profit/Loss per
Trade values across many time frames. And, among those patterns
producing a net profit per trade, the better patterns will be those with
smaller Avg Loss (100 − % Wins) values (i.e., a −3.00% Avg Loss
value is better than a −6.00% Avg Loss value). Candlestick patterns
are not perfect, so when a trade doesn’t work out, you want a pattern
whose losing trades produce on average limited losses.
To use this table you must keep in mind that a success rate of 50%
or less is not any better than a coin toss and is of no value. The two
highest and two lowest averages are emboldened in the last column.

Notice that in all four cases the number of occurrences of those pat-
terns was relatively small. They consisted of 92 patterns out of
701,402, which is only 0.013% (a little more than 1 in 10,000).
Notice the bullish Descent Block (Desc. Block +) pattern and how
it maintained a good percentage of success over all seven prediction
intervals. It averaged a 56% success rate, which is excellent. This is
how you should use this table.
Finally, the average of the averages for the seven prediction inter-
vals is shown at the bottom of Table 7-8. This offers further proof as
to the merit of candle pattern analysis. While two of the intervals
only did a well as a coin toss, the fact that most did better is good.

Reliability of Pattern Recognition
Additional information in regard to the determination of the suitability of candle patterns
is to look at the Net Profit divided by the Net Loss per Trade. This would be a measure of
the overall profitability of candle patterns based upon the prediction interval. Table 7-9
shows this data with the positive data emboldened.

From Table 7-9 one can quickly see the candle patterns that have a row full of positive
(bold) returns by taking the net profit per trade and dividing it by the net loss per trade. This
is good to know, but you must also look at the data in Table 7-8 in conjunction with this to
ensure a single candle pattern did not yield excessive losses. The data in Table 7-8 shows
only the percentage of winning trades (% Wins), but the reciprocal of that percentage
(100 − %Wins = %Losses) would yield the percentage of losing trades.

CHAPTER EIGHT
Candle Pattern
Performance
Chapter 7 dealt with the reliability issue of candle patterns and how
they performed on a relative basis over seven different prediction
intervals. This chapter will focus on the actual performance of the
candle patterns relative to other technical indicators. How many
times have you asked if candle patterns really work? This is an
attempt to give you that answer.
The following tables of data reflect the performance of 14 differ-
ent technical indicators using the perceived popular parameters for
each one. However, each table uses a different setting for analyzing
the candle patterns. The success or failure of a candle pattern is deter-
mined by the price relative to the last day of the candle pattern. For
example, in Table 8-1, the success of a candle pattern is measured by
the price one day after the pattern. If the price is lower and it was a
bearish reversal pattern or a bearish continuation pattern, then the
pattern was deemed successful. Similarly, if the price was higher for
the bearish reversal or bearish continuation pattern, then the pattern

was a failure. Stated a little differently, if the candle pattern was cor-
rect after the period being used, it was considered successful.

There are some important points to keep in mind when viewing
these tables. All common stocks from all three stock exchanges
(NYSE, Nasdaq, and Amex) were used in the analysis, 7275 issues in
all, for a little over 13 years each, which resulted in over 14.6 million
days of data and generated almost 1.7 million candle patterns.
Important:Keep in mind that each individual stock is analyzed for
its best performing indicator first, then the average of the totals of
each best performing indicator and their respective performance
when they were the best one is shown below. Similarly, the average of
all Buy and Hold performance is shown when it was the best per-
former. The above paragraph is very important to understand when
viewing and analyzing these tables.
Tables 8-1 through 8-7 show the rankings with the only changes

being in how the success or failure of a candle pattern is measured.
These tables show the measure beginning with one day in Table 8-1
up to seven days in Table 8-7. Tables 8-8 and 8-9 offer two different
measures for candle patterns and will be discussed then.
Table 8-1 shows the results with candle patterns set up to reflect
their performance after only one day (Candles (1)). You can see that
the performance of all candle patterns after only one day ranked fifth
in the ranking and did not do better than the average of buy and hold.

Chapter Eight
Table 8-8 shows the same ranking process but this time the candle
pattern success or failure is measured by always requiring a reversal
candle pattern before a position is closed out. Instead of just measur-
ing the price change after a certain number of days, the price change
is measured until a new and opposing candle pattern appears. Keep
in mind that on this analysis there was an average of one candle pat-
tern every 8.7 days.

Candle Pattern Performance
Table 8-9 shows the same ranking methodology except this time
the candle pattern success or failure is measured by waiting at least
two days and then closing out the trade only when the position fails
to continue to improve. A position fails to improve when, on the
third or later period after the trade is entered, the closing price for
that period is (1) not greater than the closing price for the previous
period for bullish candle signals, or (2) not less than the closing price
for the previous period for bearish candle signals.

It should be obvious that candle patterns, as a whole, work better
than most price-based technical indicators. There was only one
instance where they ranked less than the fifth best indicator out of
the 14 indicators tested. That is a ranking of greater than 64%, over
92% of the time.

CHAPTER NINE
Candle Pattern Filtering
Candle pattern filtering offers a method of trading with candlesticks
that is complemented by other popular technical tools for analysis.
Filtering is a concept that has been used in may other forms of tech-
nical analysis and is now a proven method with candle patterns.
If there is any fault with using a single method for market timing
and analysis, it most certainly will also be a fault with candle pat-
terns. Just like any price-based technical indicator based upon a sin-
gle concept, candle patterns will not work all of the time. When
indicators are combined or used in conjunction with one another, the
results can only improve. Again, candle patterns are no different:
when used with another indication, the results are superb.
2005 Note:Other than some minor editing, this chapter continues
to provide the details necessary to understand and use the candle pat-
tern filtering concept. At the end of the chapter are updated tables
that utilize a larger universe of stock data.
Here is a list of the technical indicators referenced in this chapter
with a brief explanation. The number in parentheses is the value of
the indicator’s parameter that was used.

THE FILTERING CONCEPT
The filtering concept was developed to assist the analyst in removing
premature candle patterns, or for that matter, eliminate most of the
early candle patterns. Because candle patterns are intensely depend-
ent upon the underlying trend of the market, lengthy trends in price
will usually cause early pattern signals, not unlike most technical
indicators. Something else had to be used to assist in the qualifica-
tions of the candle pattern signals. Most technical analysts use more
that one indicator to confirm their signals, so why not do the same
with candle patterns? The answer is the use of technical indicators.
While appearing obvious, technical indicators did not provide the
“how” answer to the problem, only the “what.”
The following discussions will try to explain the answer to the
“how” question. Most indicators have a buy and sell definition to
help in their interpretation and use. There is a point prior to a buy or
sell signal that is normally a better place for a signal to fire, but is dif-
ficult to define. Most, if not all, indicators lag the market somewhat.
This is because the components of indicator construction are the
underlying data itself. If an indicator’s parameters are set too tight,

Candle Pattern Filtering
the result will be too many bad signals, or whipsaws. Therefore, a
presignal area was determined based upon thresholds and/or indica-
tor values, whether positive or negative.
Once an indicator reaches its defined presignal area, it has been
primed to await its firing signal. The amount of time an indicator will
be in the presignal area cannot be determined. The only certainty is
that once an indicator reaches its presignal area, it will eventually
produce a trading signal (buy or sell). Statistically, it has been found
that the longer an indicator is in its presignal area, the better the
actual buy or sell signal will be.
The presignal area is the filtering area for each individual indicator,
its fingerprint. Each indicator has a different fingerprint. If the indica-

tor is in the buying presignal area, only bullish presignal area, only
bullish candle patterns will be filtered. Likewise, if an indicator is in
the selling presignal area, only bearish candle patterns are filtered.
Presignal Areas
For threshold-based indicators, the presignal area is the area between
the indicator and the thresholds, both above and below (Figure 9-1).
For oscillators, the presignal area is defined as the area after the
indicator crosses the zero line until it crosses the moving average or
smoothing used to define the trading signals (Figure 9-2).

INDICATORS
The indicators used to filter candle patterns should be easily avail-
able and simple to define. They must perform in a manner that
enables one to determine areas of buying and area of selling. These
are often referred to as overbought and oversold areas. Indicators
such as Welles Wilder’s RSI (Relative Strength Index) and George
Lane’s %K and %D (Stochastics) are exceptionally good for candle-
stick filtering because they both remain between 0 and 100. At the
end of the chapter, many other indicators will be shown to demon-
strate the filtering concept. Because RSI and Stochastics are so
widely known and used, more detail will be provided on their con-
struction and use in filtering.
WILDER’S RSI
J. Welles Wilder developed the Relative Strength Index (RSI) in the
late 1970s. It has been a popular indicator, with many different inter-
pretations. It is a simple measurement that expresses the relative
strength of the current price movement as increasing from 0 to 100.
Basically, it averages the up days and down days. Up and down days
are determined by the day’s close relative to the previous day’s close.
Do not confuse Wilder’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) with a relative
strength measure that compares two securities.
Wilder favored the use of the 14-period measurement because if
represents one-half of a natural cycle in the market. He also set the
significant levels of the indicator at 30 to 70. The lower level indi-
cates an imminent upturn and the upper level a downturn.
A plot of RSI can be interpreted using many of the classic bar
chart formations, such as head and shoulders. Divergence with

Chapter Nine
price within the period used to calculate the RSI works well, if the
divergence takes place near the upper or lower regions of the indi-
cator.
Many stock-charting services show RSI calculations based on 14
periods. Some commodity chart services prefer to use 9 periods. If
you can determine the dominant cycle of the data, that value would
be a good period to use for RSI. The levels (thresholds) for determin-
ing market turning points can also be moved. Using levels of 35 and
65 seem to work better for stocks, whereas the original levels of 30
and 70 are better for futures.
In the chart of Philip Morris (MO), presented in Figure 9-3, the
divergence of the 14-day RSI with the general price trends is quite

Candle Pattern Filtering
obvious. Whenever the RSI gets into or near the threshold, a change
in the trend of prices is soon to follow.
LANE’S STOCHASTIC OSCILLATOR: %D
George Lane developed Stochastics many years ago. A stochastic, in
this sense, is an oscillator that measures the relative position of the
closing price within the daily range. In simple terms, where is the
close relative to the range of prices over the last x periods? Just like
RSI, 14 periods seems to be a popular choice.
Stochastics is based on the commonly accepted observation that
closing prices tend to cluster near the day’s high prices as an upward
move gains strength and near the day’s lows during a decline. For
instance, when a market is about to turn from up to down, highs are
often higher, but the closing price settles near the low. This makes the
stochastic oscillator different from the most oscillators, which are
normalized representations of the relative strength, the difference
between the close and a selected trend.
The calculation of %D is simply the three period simple moving
average of %K. It is customarily displayed directly over %K, making
both of them almost impossible to see. Interpreting Stochastics
requires familiarity with the way it reacts in particular markets. The
usual initial trading signal occurs when %D crosses the extreme
bands (75 to 85 on the upside and 15 to 25 on the downside). The
actual trading signal is not made until %K crosses %D. Even though
the extreme zones help assure an adverse reaction of minimum size,
the crossing of the two lines acts in a way similar to dual moving
averages.
In Figure 9-4, the same chart of Philip Morris (MO) used in the
RSI example, we can see how good Lane’s %D is at oscillating with
the prices to areas of overbought and oversold.

FILTERING PARAMETERS
Many powerful trading and back-testing software packages are
available today. Some optimize indicators by curve-fitting the data,
while others utilize money-management techniques. A few have
advanced methods that concentrate on all possibilities. It is not going
to be the purpose here to amplify the faults or hail the innovations of
this type of analysis. The method used will be simple and straightfor-
ward in concept.
Three trading methods will be utilized in these tests: candle pat-
terns, indicators, and filtered candlesticks. Each will use the same
methodology of buying, selling short, and then covering so that a sys-
tem is in the market at all times. While this is not always a good way
to trade, it is used here to show how filtered candlesticks will usually

outperform the other two systems. Also, the trading results are shown
as if there were a closing trade on the last day of the data to give you
a feel for the complete trading history.
Additionally, a signal is generated whenever the appropriate refer-
ence indicator reaches the prescribed parameters. That is, the indica-
tor must have gone above (or below) the threshold and then cross it
again in the opposite direction. For example, when %D goes above
80, it has entered the presignal area and the sell filter is turned on for
the candle patterns. The thresholds of 20 and 80 were used here only
for purposes of explanation.
All of the indicators require a setting for the number of days (peri-
ods) to use in their calculation. As mentioned earlier, this value should
reflect the basic cycle of the market being analyzed. Two additional
values need to be set: the upper and lower threshold just mentioned.
These are the settings that determine the values that the indicator
must reach or exceed before it will filter a candle pattern.
Initially, commonly accepted values will be used: a 14-day %D,
first with thresholds of 20 and 80 and then with thresholds of 65 and
35 on different data. The data used will be the stocks of the S&P 100
index and the 30 stocks of the Dow Industrial Average. The S&P 100
database started at the beginning of 1989 and ended on March 31,
1992. The Dow Industrials database began on April 24, 1990, and
ended on March 31, 1992.
FILTERING EXAMPLES
From Table 9-1 you can see that trading each stock using candle pat-
terns for the advice resulted in 67 stocks with positive percentage
gains and 33 losers. These numbers came simply from counting the
positive and negative results in the first column. Trading strictly on
the candle pattern signals resulted in an average of 37.1 trades, with
an average gain per trade of 0.40%.

Chapter Nine
Trading the same 100 stocks using only %D for the trading signals
resulted in only 53 stocks that were winners and 47 losers. The num-
ber of average trades was reduced to 30.01, with an average gain of
0.02% per trade.
Using the filtering concept for the trading signals resulted in 62 win-
ners and 39 losers. This was not as good as using the candle patterns by
themselves, but was much better than using signals generated strictly
from the stochastic indicator %D. The average number of trades was
13.7, which is better than candle patterns or %D by over 50%. The
average gain per trade was 0.60% which, again, is significantly better
than the average gain from the other two trading methods.
What does all of this really tell you? First, by filtering the candle
patterns with an indicator, such as %D, the number of trades is sig-
nificantly reduced. Compared to candle patterns alone, the reduction
was over 63%, and compared to trades using the indicator %D
alone, the reduction was over 54%. Second, filtering increased the
average gain per trade. The increase over candle patterns alone was
50% and the increase over the %D was over 30 times as great.
You should not ignore or forget what is known about using statis-
tics to make a point; they can be manipulated to show whatever
results the author is trying to make. We all know that an average gain
of 0.6% would quickly disappear when we included commissions,
slippage, and the like. The simplicity of these calculations, though,
shows one very important point: It is the relationship of the numbers
with each other that is important, not the actual numbers. This rela-
tionship, taken as an average of the values derived from 100 different
stocks, is the proof needed to support the filtering concept.
Table 9-1 shows the results of the filtering concept by averaging the
data on the 100 stocks of the S&P 100 Index. To keep the number of
tables and the amount of information to a reasonable number, the next
example will use the 30 stocks that make up the Dow Industrials.

with an average per-trade gain of 0.02%. Using the indicator %D
gave an average number of trades of 23.7, with an average gain (loss)
per trade of negative 0.46%. Finally, using the filtered candle pattern
as the trading device yielded an average number of trades of only
10.6, with an average gain per trade of 0.23%. Again, it must be
stressed that it is the relationship of these numbers that is important,
not their actual values.
INDIVIDUAL STOCK ANALYSIS
Selecting a stock to use in all of the different indicator examples was
quite a problem. Not that is was difficult to find a good one; most
work quite well with the filtering concept. The problem was in main-
taining credibility so that you would not think that the universe was
combed looking for the perfect example. Therefore, it was decided to
use the first stock in both lists of the S&P 100 and the Dow Industri-
als, Alcoa (AA). Figure 9-5 shows a high-low bar chart of Alcoa
along with a histogram of its volume for the period of analysis used
in the following examples.
In Figures 9-6 through 9-18, 13 different indicators are displayed
above the candlestick charts of AA. The chart displays only the latest
140 trading days, but the trading analysis still covers the data begin-
ning January 1, 1989, and ending March 31, 1992 (3-1⁄ years). The up
4
and down arrows at the top of the chart (above the indicator) show the
signals given automatic candle pattern identification arrows showing
each candle pattern and whether it is bullish (up arrow) or bearish
(down arrow). If the candle pattern arrow is shown with a double
head, it represents a filtered candle pattern. The box in the lower right
corner of the charts displays the trading information for the three trad-
ing methods. The information in the box shows the effective dates, the
total percentage gain or loss, the number of trading signals, and the

average percentage gain or loss per trade. You will note that the trad-
ing results of the candle patterns by themselves will be the same for all
examples. The data did not change, therefore the candle patterns are
the same. Only the indicator and, therefore, the filtered candle patterns
will change with each example. For all indicator examples, the total
gain using candle patterns alone for trading Alcoa (AA) was 45.8%
over the period from January 3, 1989 to March 31, 1992. There were
40 trades, which made the average gain per trade equal to 1.14%.
The price of Alcoa on the first day, January 3, 1989, was 55.875
and on the last day, March 31, 1992, was 70.5. So that you will have
a basis for judgment, a buy and hold strategy would have yielded
slightly more than 26%, Again, neither calculations for commissions
nor execution slippage have been figured, nor have the figures been

annualized. Because the trading strategy has been kept so simple, one
must consider only the relative values when viewing these concepts.
One more thing might not be obvious: all trading is figured up to
the value of the closing price on the last day of the data. This does not
necessarily mean that a trading signal occurred on that day, only that
the percentage gain or loss was calculated as if a valid signal had been
given.
Figure 9-6 shows the %D indicator for 14 days, using threshold
values of 20 and 80 for the trading signals. The total gain for the fil-
tered candlesticks was not significantly different from that for the
indicator alone. However, the number of trades was significantly
reduced, bringing the average gain per trade for the filtered candles
up to 4.79%, in other words, over 100% better than the indicator.

old values of 20 and 80. The difference between %K and %D is only
that %D reacts slightly slower than %K. Remember, %D is just a
three-period moving average of %K. In this example, the filtered can-
dles were over three times better than %K when looking at the aver-
age gain per trade.
Because %K reacts quicker than %D, one could lower the upper
threshold and raise the lower threshold to give a larger filtering area.
This would normally generate more trades. For example, by chang-
ing the threshold to 25 and 75, the filtered candles gained 71.6%,
with 21 trades for an average gain per trade of 3.41%. Using a larger
filtering area was not quite as good as the original example, however,
because although it did, in fact, increase the number of trades it did
not increase the overall gain. The results of the indicator %K were
only slightly improved to 51.9%. Opening up the thresholds to 30
and 70 increased the filtered candle trades to 27 with a gain of only
31.5%. The indicator actually decreased in performance to 45.6%.
This shows that the higher thresholds of 20 and 80 tend to produce
better results for filtering without changing the indicator results
appreciably.
Figure 9-8 shows Wilder’s RSI for 14 days, with threshold values
of 35 and 65. The average gain for the filtered candles was over twice
as good as the average gain from RSI. When you consider that there
were also fewer trades, the average gain per trade for the filtered can-
dles was exceptionally better than RSI.
Figure 9-9 shows the money flow index. Money flow is calculated
similarly to RSI, but the days when the price closes higher are aver-
aged separately from the days when the price closes lower. In this
case a period of 21 days was used for the smoothing of both the up
closes and the down closes. Prior to smoothing, the change in price
each day is multiplied by the volume for that day. This way an up day
with large volume would cause a larger move in the indicator than
would a similar up day with little volume. Once the two averages are

calculated, they are further operated upon to produce an indicator
that moves between 0 to 100.
As you can see from the trading box in Figure 9-9, the filtering
concept once again performs much better than the indicator itself,
even though the indicator did quite well.
Figure 9-10 shows an indicator known as the rate of change. Rate
of change is a fairly simple concept that is widely used by many ana-
lysts. Here a 10-day rate of change is used by taking the percentage
difference between the closing price today and the closing price 10
days ago. For example, if the value of the rate of change indicator
were 7.5%, one could deduce that the price on that day was 7.5%
greater than the price 10 days ago.
The trading signals for the indicator cannot be given by thresholds
because the up and down values are theoretically unlimited. There-
fore, the trading signals are generated by the crossing of the indicator
with its own 10-period smoothing. Ten periods for the smoothing
value is used for most indicators that work this way. Better values
may exist for certain stocks or commodities, but 10 seems to be con-
sistently good.
The rate of change indicator did better than the candle patterns
and much better than the filtered patterns when looking at total gain.
Because the filtered candles almost always result in fewer trades, the
average gain was better with the indicators, but not significantly so.
The filtering area occurs after the indicator crosses the zero line and
before the indicator crosses its own smoothing.
Figure 9-11 shows Arms’ Ease of Movement Indicator for 13 peri-
ods. The signal is generated when it crosses its own 10-period
smoothing. Ease of Movement is a numerical method used to quan-
tify the shape of a box used in Equivolume charting. Arms takes a
ration of the box width to the range. Heavy volume days with the
same price range results in a higher box ratio and, therefore, difficult
movement.

Based upon total gain, this indicator did not do better than candles
alone or filtered candles. Likewise, when the number of trades in
considered, filtered candles did much better.
Figure 9-12 shows the double momentum oscillator for 18 peri-
ods. Like most oscillators, a signal is generated when it crosses its
own 10-day smoothing. The double momentum oscillator is a com-
bination of two rate of change calculations, which are 20% above
and below the value set for the indicator. In this example, the indica-
tor value is set for the indicator. In this example, the indicator value
is set at 18, so the two rate of change calculations are 14 and 22.
In this example, the filtered candles greatly outperformed the indi-
cator.

the chosen period, in this case 15 days. Because the LTI is such a
smooth line, a shorter 5-day crossover smoothing was used.
From the trading box in Figure 9-13, the indicator generated good
results, but the filtering concept failed to do better than the indicator
or the candles. Filtered candlesticks obviously do not work every time.
Figure 9-14 shows Wilder’s Directional Index for 14 periods.
Again, signals are generated when it crosses its own 10-day smooth-
ing. Wilder developed the directional index along with the RSI in
1978 (see bibliography). Using signals from a simple crossover
smoothing is not the method Wilder suggested for its use. However,
that was the only method that would generate a filtering area.
The filtering concept did quite well here also. Notice that even
though the indicator did not do very well, the filtered candles did
almost three times better.

Figure 9-15 shows the price detrend oscillator for 21 periods. This
indicator is the difference between the closing price and a smoothing
of the closing price, in this case 21 days. Signals are generated when
PDO crosses its own 10-period smoothing.
Here is an example where the indicator was exceptional and the
filtered candles were a failure. The suspected problem is in defining
the filtering area used on the indicator.
Figure 9-16 shows Appel’s Moving Average Convergence Diver-
gence Indicator, known as MACD. MACD is an extension of the
price detrend oscillator, in that another smoothed value is used
instead of the closing price. MACD uses the difference between a
12-day smoothing and a 25-day smoothing. Signals are generated
when this difference crosses its own 9-day smoothing. Nine days
were used here because that is the popular setting used by most
analysis. Incidentally, in keeping with the previous use of 10 days for
the smoothing value, it actually improved the indicator trading
results by over 7%.
MACD did not perform well in this example. However, filtered
candle patterns yielded an average of 4.29% per trade.
Figure 9-17 shows Lambert’s Commodity Channel Index for 14
periods. Signals are given whenever CCI crosses the thresholds of
100 and −100. The Commodity Channel Index was designed for use
with commodities that exhibit cyclical and/or seasonal characteris-
tics. It consists of the mean deviation over the number of periods
selected, in this case, 14.
Filtered candles, again, did exceptionally well when compared to
the indicator or candle patterns.
Figure 9-18 shows Bollinger’s Oscillator, %B for 20 periods. %B
is another method of displaying the Bollinger Bands developed
by John Bollinger. Bollinger Bands used two standard deviations
over a period of 20 days to encase about 95% of the price action.
It is an excellent way to show the volatility of the market. %B

looks merely at the closing price relative to the upper and lower
Bollinger Bands, much in the same way as Stochastics are calcu-
lated. %B is a measure of where the closing price is relative to
the Bollinger Bands. Signals are generated whenever %B exceeds
100% and 0%.
From the trading box in Figure 8-18, you can see that %B by itself
gives excellent trading results, but when used as a filter for candle
patterns, the results for average gain are even better.
FILTERED CANDLE PATTERN PERFORMANCE
Table 9-3 shows more recent results of candle patterns and eleven
technical indicators that were used to filter the candle patterns. The
results speak for themselves. Filtering candle patterns improved per-
formance across the board. Filtering candle patterns with any of the
indicators yielded results that were better than using candle patterns
by themselves.
The table shows the number of trades using each indicator as a fil-
ter, along with the thresholds or crossing values of the indicator used
as the filter. It shows the best trade and the worst trade performance.
At the bottom of the table, the results are summarized and displayed
in the order of Net Percentage Gain (Net%Gain).
CONCLUSION
If you couple the facts presented in the previous chapter showing
how candle patterns performed relative to other technical indicators,
and then consider the filtering concept’s obvious improvement to
that, you have a winner. It should be obvious that filtering candle

also reduce transactions costs and produce a much higher average

CHAPTER TEN
Candlesticks for Traders
This chapter was contributed by Ryan Litchfield.
A Note from Greg Morris: “Candlesticks for Traders” is a totally
new chapter in this third edition of Candlestick Charting Explained.
Ryan Litchfield called me one day in the late 1990s and invited me to
a downtown Dallas hotel for lunch. He was teaching a trading semi-
nar and only had an hour. The hour went by so fast we could not
believe it. Of course it is easy to sit and listen to someone praise your
book, but Ryan took a totally new view on candlesticks, one that was
really exciting. He invited me into the seminar to say a few words.
His students were mesmerized by candlesticks, not from anything I
said, but by what Ryan had been teaching them. We communicated
over the last few years and met on occasion. Once I decided to do a
third edition of this book, I thought a section by Ryan would be a
great addition. It turned out to be much more and much better than
I ever thought it would. I hope you agree.

Chapter Ten
INTRODUCTION
In the neurotic world of trading, an edge of any sort can catch on
quickly. Candlestick charting has steadily gained acceptance among
traders and investors over the last two decades. The titillating allure
of candlesticks comes from their foreign importation and exotic, sto-
ried past. They are now featured in almost every charting service and
they are the focus of many Web sites and books. If they were just
another way to display open, high, low, and close, they could not
have captured the attention of so many people.
Candles bring with them some 200 years of application and inter-
pretation and that makes them worthy of serious study and integra-
tion with Western tools, but for 20 years they have spread into the
mainstream of Western technical analysis with little more than the
translation of the old texts and enthusiasm.
Greg Morris, one of the original two proponents of candlesticks to
the West, was the first to do statistical work on the frequency and
accuracy of candle patterns, but computing power was so limited
compared to now and the public interest was on learning this new
system, not on some data charts in the back of the book. Now,
finally, a thorough work has been done to look deep into what can-
dles really are and are not—to place them in context and properly
blend their actual skills and value with the tried and true tools of
Western charting.
Candlesticks have been allowed to proliferate without proper per-
spective. They have gained almost mythical proportion as ancient
and secret trading tools and self-proclaimed experts abound, but
what are they really? How can they be fully and properly integrated
with Western analytics? How accurate are they? Is accuracy their full
contribution? What are the “good signals?” Do all the patterns have
to be memorized? This book combines the first exhaustive and thor-
ough statistical analysis of candlestick patterns with a thorough

Candlesticks for Traders
study of their accuracy and proper application to trading. While
great credit and respect is due the pioneers of candlestick charting of
the West, it is past time for this edition.
Greg Morris recognized the need to enhance and broaden his land-
mark work, and has done the most comprehensive statistical analysis
ever on candlesticks. With the trading application analysis of Ryan
Litchfield, this book sets the high-water mark for those who want to
know how to properly integrate candlesticks into their trading. What
follows from Ryan is the practical application and perspective
traders need to really put candles in context. Candlesticks are not
magical; they make sense, can be easily learned, and are only myste-
rious to the uninformed. Western pattern charting is far superior to
candlesticks for trend and pattern recognition, but the two styles are
not in competition. Candlesticks are a very short term (a few days)
sentiment indicator while Western pattern trading can project price
targets and behavior for weeks, months, and years. The delicate
dance of support and resistance at pivotal price points is tremen-
dously enhanced when bathed in candlelight.
Twenty years ago, without modern computing power the proper
analysis of candlesticks was not possible and the hungry Western
traders created a market that made it unnecessary. All previous
attempts to do accuracy studies have lacked context and depth. This
comprehensive work shines a long overdue bright light on candle-
sticks, and traders can now properly integrate East and West.
EAST-WEST SYNERGY
When candlestick charting was introduced to the Western markets it
was a novelty, but it now enjoys widespread acceptance. This may be
explained in part by the natural human tendency to seek out a com-
petitive advantage. The proliferation of financial publications, new

electronic toys, new technical indicators, and trading software is evi-
dence of that appetite to get ahead. Some traders seem to get an
almost cultish, tunnel-visioned obsession about their favorite secret
weapon or tool, and while candlestick charting is as good as or bet-
ter than any charting tool, it is not a mysterious or magical secret
weapon to divine the markets.
With about 200 years of application, candlesticks are the most
tried and tested charting methodology, and they can be quite good at
interpreting and predicting short-term behavior and short-term chart
movement. Over the last century the West has also developed some
great tools for chart pattern reading and technical analysis. The good
news is that when properly integrated, candlesticks and Western chart
analysis can combine to form a sum that is greater than its parts.
This chapter is focused on providing a foundation for traders to
appreciate the real value and contribution that candlestick charting
can make to Western traders. Details of pattern construction, recog-
nition, and application will be explored in later chapters.
Candlesticks along with other technical toys and tools are of little
value to a trader unless properly trained in their use. Unfortunately, the
majority of traders who try to incorporate candles into their trading
misunderstand what candlesticks can do, and generally expect more
from candlesticks than they are capable of delivering. Traders should
not expect candlestick signals to divine the market and call out trades.
The full integration of candlestick charting has been hampered by
a tendency among many proponents to see them as an alternative.
While they are a superior alternative to Western bar charts, they are
not a substitute for Western chart patterns. The appropriate blending
of East and West requires an understanding of:
• The unique value of candlesticks.
■ The application to trading and investing.
■ The process that generates price action and drives patterns.

■ The way news affects price.
■ The correlation with Western technical indicators that
leads to the appropriate integration with the Western style
pattern trading.
So Who Needs Candlesticks?
There is a basic premise to build on here. Simply put, candlestick
charting is not needed to trade well. Say what? In a book about the
value of candlesticks, that may seem an odd premise. Granted, but it
is key to understanding and appreciating the unique contribution
they can make.
Consistent patterns with support and resistance define the entry
points for bullish and bearish trades (see Figures 10-1 and 10-2). As

long as the pattern is intact, there is not much need for anything more
than the picture to trade the pattern.
What candles bring to the table is a visual dynamic that reveals the
attitude or behavior of the traders as they approach the pivot points
of support and resistance. Trading is therefore enhanced by patterns
that describe sentiment and behavior. Given that the patterns have
been studied for over 200 years, their insight must be considered a
valid addition.
Investing versus Trading
Investing
Candlesticks have little or no value to investors. Investing is funda-
mentally driven, and other than general lip service to buying low and

Candlesticks for Traders
catching an upside movement for a few months or years, it is a buy
and hope approach to the market. Long-term bullish positions may
be initiated by major pullbacks, or just the expectation that histori-
cally good companies tend to go up, or the ever popular “hot tip.”
Sadly, in most cases, institutional and public buying comes well after
the ideal entry point, and selling is often near a bottom after the pain
of a reversal gets too much to take.
Candlesticks are a short-term trading tool for fine-tuning entry and
exit decisions, so they do not help long-term investing very much.
Trading
Trading by contrast is pattern driven and generally short term. Here
candlesticks can be very valuable, as entry and exits are much more
crucial. Pivot points are the recognizable and predictable price points
where significant moves may take place. Trading is anticipating a
potential price action, positioning to enter the early stage of the trade,
adding to it as it develops, and then exiting as it matures and sets up a
reversal. Trading is opportunistic, and it follows the surging of trends
or the waves of an oscillating pattern. Trading also involves lots of
reversals, and this is where candles shine the brightest (see Figure
10-3). Candlestick patterns are reversal signals; and even though con-
tinuation patterns are widely written about, they actually represent
failed reversals.
Candlestick charting is therefore more valuable to traders than to
investors because the short-term strength of candlesticks merges well
with the cyclical nature of pattern trading.
Price and Pattern Manipulation
Candles can add so much insight to trading, but how price action and
patterns develop must be understand to properly integrate Japanese
candlesticks with Western chart patterns.

The tendency for trading patterns to form is well documented, but
very little is offered to explain why and how they form. Exploring
why patterns develop will set the stage for the powerful contribution
that candles can make to trading Western markets. The fact that a
pattern exists is evidence of price manipulation, which in turn creates
predictability that produces profitability for those who can see the
patterns.
“Pattern = manipulation = predictability = profitability.”
The likelihood of the price patterns not being manipulated is sim-
ilar to a pile of lumber being dumped off a cliff and landing in the
shape of a house. It’s a pretty safe bet that someone has been manip-
ulating the lumber (see Figure 10-4).

Chart patterns in stocks, commodities, and even in indexes is evi-
dence that a diverse group of players can interact in a free market and
somehow create a masterpiece. It is fascinating that a free market,
where the players are supposedly not deliberately cooperating, con-
sistently drops piles of lumber off cliffs that land in the shape of nice
little houses with smoke coming out of the chimneys. The issue is not
if it happens, but how and how candlesticks can help in trading those
patterns.
The Players
Traders come in various strengths and potencies, and there is a lead
dog or two in every well-traded issue. Whether on the trading floor
or on a yacht in Mission Bay San Diego, they are the E.F. Huttons or
Warren Buffetts of that particular stock. When they take action
everyone who is in the know pays attention. There is a reaction order
among the various levels of traders that tends to create a chain reac-
tion like the ripples from throwing a pebble into a pond.
The pebble represents the key trader or small group of key traders
for a particular stock or commodity. The “Ax” (one name for key
traders) makes a significant move, and a second tier of traders picks
up the action. If successive waves of institutional traders and the pub-
lic follow suit, a momentum swing is underway (see Figure 10-5).



==================================================

==================================================

(cid:2) 400
Chapter Ten
Figure 10-5
The ripples that move out from the center are like the gradual entry
of the rest of the cast into a directional price move of a stock.
So the Ax moves first, then other professionals pick up on the
action, which stirs interest in institutions and managed funds and the
public brings up the rear. It all works rather well considering that a
big part of the cast (the public) does not even know that they are part
of a production. This is like the ultimate reality show where part of
the cast is oblivious to their roles, the other players, or even the game.
Now the key traders (the Ax and other professional traders) are
very influential, but it takes sustained volume from the rest of the
cast to really carry a directional move for very long. The days or
weeks it may take to move from support to resistance (or vice versa)
will take the participation of the rest of the players.
The key traders just get the directional move started. Because they
cannot do it alone, the key traders make the move when they sense
the public is ready to support it. If the key traders are right, the rip-
ples carry their profitable positions on toward the next pivot point.
As the trade moves forward they watch for weakening momentum,
and will test each pivot point by buying or selling to determine if it is
time to switch gears.

Candlesticks for Traders
This sequence of participation starting with the key traders and
continuing down to the last public buyers or sellers is what makes the
patterns develop. The key traders wait to see the last buyers climb on
board and then they short the trade to see if it starts a selloff. At the
bottom, they wait until the selling pressure dries up and then they
buy. A popular phrase is that the key traders want to have everyone
on board at the top and be alone in their trading at the bottom (see
Figure 10-6).
Sometimes the support does not materialize and the key traders
know better than to fight the tape. They will quickly switch positions
to find the right fit with the market. This can explain the many whip-
saws that develop as the new directional move suddenly reverses and
the early birds who are not alert get caught in the crossfire. The can-

dles may have given a solid reversal signal, but then the price whips
back the other way. The reason may not be clear, but there was a rea-
son. There is a lot at risk here. The key traders will take the lead, but
they will not ride a lame horse very long.
Traders do not like choppy or indecisive patterns because they can
get violent and bloody or just boring. Climbing in a clothes dryer is
just no fun. The actual direction of a price move is not really the issue
as much as it is just getting a direction going. Actually, a downtrend
is preferable because it triggers fear, which can make for very quick
and profitable movements.
Now the unsuspecting public plays a crucial role in pattern devel-
opment primarily because they suffer from collective short-term
amnesia. They provide the heavy lifting to raise the trade to a resis-
tance level, and they leave in a crescendo to signal the bottom. Human
nature being what it is, the next upswing will likely draw all the
bloodied and battered eternal optimists back onto the dance floor,
unaware of their crucial role in the process. It sure helps to keep pat-
terns repeating when one major group unwittingly, but repeatedly,
steps up to be cannon fodder. The fact that the “less informed and
less savvy public” includes a lot of fund managers who can’t read a
chart with any measure of skill also helps.
Candlesticks are valuable when used to read the behavior of the
cast of players whose aggregate actions produce the patterns. Their
behavior at support and resistance levels can be very telling and valu-
able. The candlesticks reflect the interaction of the players—their
emotion, sentiment, and momentum as they revisit familiar ground.
Pattern Variations
The idea that there are key traders in most well-traded stocks may be
news to many, but it is true. The vast majority of traders and or
investors will never meet or know of the key traders in a particular

stock, but they will nonetheless feel the influence (great or small) that
the key traders exert on the market. Some chart patterns suggest a
very cohesive, almost cooperative interaction of the cast of players
(key traders to the last private party), while others are anything but.
Nice, clean, predictable turns at support and resistance tell one
story and sloppy, overlapping days with erratic reversals tell another
(see Figures 10-7 and 10-8). Traders should first find stocks with
well-defined trading patterns, and then use candlesticks to fine-tune
their entry and exit points. But keep in mind, all the candlestick
knowledge in the world won’t prevent being whipsawed in some
stocks. The players may just not have much cohesiveness. Some
stocks must be played from a distance if at all.
With over 30,000 stocks, plus futures, commodities, currencies
etc.; finding good patterns to trade will not be difficult. The great

news is that well-patterned stocks (which imply cohesive traders)
tend to produce the most reliable candle signals. The behavior of one
group of traders can vary dramatically from another, which brings up
another interesting correlation: certain stocks tend to throw certain
candlestick patterns more often than others (see Figures 10-9 and
10-10). This makes good sense given that candles simply reflect the
activity of the traders. IBM has very little in the way of tails or shad-
ows. The closes tend to be near the highs or lows of the day. Citi-
group (C) tends to have long tails or shadows and show much more
volatility.
A stock tends to have the same group of traders month in and
month out, so repeated patterns should be reviewed to see how con-
sistently they follow through. Because reversals tend to happen at
predictable support and resistance levels, the study of the trader’s

behavior at those levels can help to recognize similar behavior the
next time those levels are reached. Historically consistent trading
patterns may add confidence to trades, and here again candlesticks
excel, as they are the most studied tool for reading trading behavior
at reversal points.
Playing News
News is a factor in trading; whether scheduled or a surprise, it can
interrupt and distort existing price action. The reaction to the news
can be gradual, violent, or nonexistent, but the market sentiment will
be spelled out by the subsequent candle patterns. If the news supports
the direction of the current move, it tends to move the price faster
toward where it was going anyway, sometimes overnight. Big candle
bodies indicate strong sentiment among the traders, and small bodies
mean lack of follow-through. Long tails express volatile, even violent
contention over the direction, and small tails reveal consensus or lack
of interest.
News often produces big days (reaction or statement days). If a big
day (or two) moves in the direction of the current trend, a very sig-
nificant candle pattern may be forming. The Rising and Falling Three
Method continuation patterns start with a large day (or two) in the
direction of the trend and are followed by two to four testing days as
traders probe to find out how strong the news really was (See Figure
10-11). If the direction of the trend (up or down) then continues, the
sentiment is verified.
News can also be very fickle. Market sentiment can cause a $5 piece
of news to get a $2 reaction one day and a $9 reaction the next. Big
news can be neutralized by an opposing market trend, and minor news
can get a big response out of a bored market. News happening at sup-
port and resistance points can influence the potential reversal, so
traders should pay some attention as the news may trigger or exagger-

ate a reversal or continuation. Candle signals can also reveal the senti-
ment of the traders as a stock runs up or pulls back ahead of a pend-
ing news release.
While it is important to understand the effects of news on patterns,
traders must focus on the pattern and the candle signals, and not a lot
on the news itself.
Technical Indicators
There are a myriad of technical indicators available to traders, and
regardless of which indicators are used, blending them with candle-
sticks and good charting skills can produce a more in-depth picture
of the price action. For example, a stock may be approaching a sup-
port level defined by a trend line or moving average. The candlesticks
signal a loss of momentum and reversal. The technical indicators
show an oversold condition. Considered together, full confirmation

from the various “consultants” (each with their own special perspec-
tive) helps to trade with greater confidence.
One word of caution: Candles are trumped by the actual price
action, and good traders remember they are trading the stock, not the
indicators. They choose their indicators (“consultants”) carefully and
never take them too seriously. Indicators monitor and reflect behav-
ior; they do not dictate it. Indicators are the sight, not the trigger.
So, returning to the premise, are candlesticks needed to trade well?
No, so the question is, why learn to trade with candlesticks? The
answer is that trading can be much better with them.
Integration—East and West
Western Line Charts may point out a great chart pattern with clear
support and resistance, but they do not show what is going on behind
the scenes. Western Bar Charts show the intraday movement of the
stock, but they are very difficult to interpret at a glance (see Figure
10-12). Candlesticks give quicker and more intuitive feedback to a

trader, and 200 years of collective experience and study simply make
them better tools.
Japanese candlesticks will never replace Western chart patterns, but
the strength and advantages of both make their combination superior
to either used separately. The key to making the most of the blend is
playing to their respective strengths. Japanese candles will never pick
out and highlight a double bottom bounce off support, but they can
reflect the bullish or bearish attitude of the traders (see Figure 10-13).
The best of Eastern and Western charting skills truly enhance a
trader’s ability to read the sentiment, emotion, and momentum at
major pivot points, and react appropriately to it. Put another way,
the Western charting shows the customers entering the deli and the
Japanese candlesticks show how hungry they are.

SUMMARY—EAST-WEST SYNERGY
• Candles are the most tested and studied form of technical
analysis.
• Western pattern charting adds a viable and valuable
dimension that enhances candlestick charting.
• Candles apply differently to investing and trading.
• The motives and dynamics of price and pattern develop-
ment help to interpret candles’ messages.
• The level of cohesiveness among the traders creates chart
patterns that vary greatly, from predictable and consistent
to choppy and dangerous. Be selective in choosing pat-
terns to trade.
• Certain stocks throw distinctive patterns that reflect the
behavior of that group of traders.
• News is a market reality and candles can reveal the
traders’ valuation of it.
• Technical indicators are enlightening and should be con-
sidered as advisory. They do not overrule the price action.
This includes candlesticks. They predict; they do not guar-
antee.
• Western charts highlight crucial locations and Japanese
Candlesticks reveal the attitude and sentiment.
LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION
The classic real-estate mantra of “location, location, location” has a
perfectly legitimate application to candlestick charting analysis. The
location of a single candle or pattern has a great deal to do with its
relevance and therefore its accuracy. A couple of analogies will illus-
trate the principle well.

Falling Leaves
In southern climates, leaves will periodically turn color and fall off
throughout the year due to wind and weather, but it goes virtually
unnoticed. In northern climates it is taken very seriously. In late Sep-
tember, the first sign of changing color and dropping leaves gets a
great deal of attention. There is an expectation associated with late
September that winter will arrive soon, and the clearest signal is the
visual display of the leaves. Now the signal is not a guarantee that
foul weather is here but recognition that it is September, and condi-
tions are now ready for it to happen.
Candlestick signals and patterns are defined by the size of bodies,
length of tails, and proximity to neighboring candles. Some require
certain conditions like being in trends, but there are further refine-
ments that will help traders interpret the importance of their signals.
Western pattern trading gives relevance to the location of a stock
or index. A pattern of support and resistance has a built-in expecta-
tion of significant movement at certain price points due to the histor-
ical behavior of that stock or index. The reversal or continuation
signals from candlesticks are therefore more valuable at a location
already designated for debating the fate of the pattern. Patterns can
be successfully traded without candlesticks, but the candlesticks
unique ability to illuminate behavior at these key pivot points can be
extremely valuable to a trader with a trained eye. Another analogy:
Brake Lights
When brake lights come on there is a conditioned response based on
past experience. When asked what brake lights mean, most people
say someone is stopping. This statement illustrates the danger in
assumptions. The fact is there are several reasonable answers.
In general, brake lights do mean stop; however, if brake lights are

observed at 75 m.p.h. on the freeway, it most likely means the driver is
simply adjusting the speed to the surrounding vehicles, not stopping.
Could the brake lights on the freeway mean stopping? Of course, but
that would be rare considering their location and circumstances.
Brake lights at 35 m.p.h. approaching an intersection most likely
mean stop, but here again there are actually several things that could
happen (see Figure 10-15). The driver may slow and then accelerate
on through. He may stop and sit there for a while trying to decide
what to do next. He may turn right or he may reverse and head the
other way. Approaching the intersection, the implication that the car
will stop is very strong, but what happens next is still a mystery.
A fundamental law of physics states that an object in motion tends
to stay in motion, but it is also a fact that in order to reverse direction
an object must come to a stop. Whether a stock will stay in motion or
stop depends a lot on whether it is on the freeway or approaching an

intersection. Whether it will sit there, reverse, or continue will be
revealed soon enough, but being at the intersection indicates a major
decision will be made, which is also the most basic and important
message of candlesticks. Does the message match the location?
A familiar caution goes “A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.”
Many traders experience frustration when an expected behavior from
a candle pattern does not happen. A common mistake is neglecting
qualifiers, like which direction the stock must be moving to properly
identify the pattern. A perfect-looking Bullish Engulfing pattern may
be in a location that nullifies the signal (see Figure 10-16). It may be

Chapter Ten
an Outside Day pattern, but if it is in an uptrend it will not be giving
a bullish reversal signal.
Greg Morris puts it this way, “You can’t have a bullish reversal in
an uptrend.” An uptrend, for the purpose of candlestick interpreta-
tion, is defined by a 10-day exponential moving average. A bullish
reversal must start from below the 10-day moving average, and in
an upswing it will be above the average, so a bullish reversal is not
possible.
In an uptrend or downtrend with cycles, bullish and bearish rever-
sals may occur at retracements that seem to contradict the statement
above (see Figure 10-17). This is a technical exception, and other
important concepts for understanding how to use candlesticks when
playing trends are discussed later in this chapter. The message is what
is important; if it is not technically a bullish reversal signal, the loca-
tion frames the context to interpret the message, and it is still bullish.
Many one-day candles are misnamed and misunderstood, but
what really counts is the message and location. A Hammer and a
Hanging Man pattern are often mistaken for each other. Other than

location, they have identical rules; even the acceptable variations are
the same. The basic message is indecision and the only difference is
location (see Figure 10-18). The Hammer and Hanging Man patterns
say the directional pressure and momentum have come to a stop and
the long tail indicates it was not a consensus. The Hammer indicates
an attempt to keep the momentum going, but a change in sentiment
abruptly reversed the momentum by the end of the day. The Hanging
Man suggests a mugging. No further trend movement; rather a solid
reversal that was rebuffed, but it took the whole day’s effort just to
get back near the start of the day. Both suggest a reversal because the
opposition made a very significant show of force at a known pivot
point, but the net result is that momentum came to a stop.
Hammer and Hanging Man patterns often happen away from sup-
port and resistance levels without accompanying reversals. A hesita-
tion or retracement is normal in a bullish or bearish move, and away
from support or resistance, the Hammer and or Hanging Man still
mean hesitation and indecision, but it is more like the brake lights on
the freeway, slowing not stopping.
While getting the name right is less important than getting the mes-
sage right, getting the message right in the right location trumps
everything. Misreading brake lights can be confusing, frustrating, and
downright dangerous. Misreading candles can be confusing, frustrat-
ing, and downright expensive.

Chapter Ten
From a purely statistical perspective the majority of candles fall
between 40–60% in accuracy, a rather ambiguous range. But this
range includes all the occurrences, whether on the freeway or at
an intersection. Taken in context (i.e., location) the interpretation
changes and whatever the signal, it takes on greater significance if it
is happening at an obvious support and or resistance level.
Reversal or Retracement
A retracement is a pause or rest in a directional move, while a rever-
sal spells the end of the directional move. The interpretation of can-
dlesticks will vary depending on whether a trader is trying to follow a
trend or play the cycles of the trend. Playing the trend means ignoring
the retracements, while playing the cycles of the trend means chang-
ing positions at the swing points of the pattern (see Figure 10-19).
Reversal signals must accompany the cyclical swings of a trend, so
correctly using candles to confirm the end of a trend is especially
important to the trend-following trader. In an uptrend (and this
applies reciprocally for downtrends), the bearish reversal signals will
come at the top of a cycle when the trend looks very healthy, but

what does the signal mean? Is it the end of the trend or the start of a
retracement? The end of the trend is actually signaled when the bot-
tom of a cycle fails to rally up, so the reversal patterns at the top of a
cycle must be seen as retracements or setbacks, not reversals. The
trend is still intact until the support level is broken (see Figure 10-20).
Bullish Trends Depend on Bullish Reversals
The uptrend will continue only if it survives challenges to the support
levels, which will be signaled by bullish reversal patterns. The irony
to the trend-playing trader is that the signals that say the bullish
uptrend is over will not be bearish reversal signals at resistance. The
end of a bullish uptrend will most likely be a continuation signal (a
failed bullish rally) that pushes down through support. (See Figure
10-21.)
It is mandatory then to know where a signal is happening because
its relevance depends greatly on its location. Following an uptrend
requires knowing where to read bearish continuation signals and
bullish reversals. Will the buyers support another run to the upside or
is the bullish sentiment weak enough to warrant pushing the price
down to test for buyers? This is the pivotal part of following a trend

and the irony is that at support, reversal signals preserve the uptrend
and continuation signals end it.
Playing the Cycles of a Trend
Playing the cycles of a trend with candlesticks requires knowing the
pattern of support and resistance and the reversal and continuation
patterns that may happen there. At resistance, bearish reversal signals
will close bullish trades and open bearish positions for the retrace-
ment. When at resistance, continuation patterns can signal breakouts.
At support, reversal patterns signal a resumption of the trend and
continuation signals may spell the trend break (see Figure 10-22).
Unlike a technical indicator that can be scaled to fit different time
frames, candle signals are one to five days long and they predict only
a few days ahead. As a result, width of the pattern cycle is important.
Some candlestick patterns require that the stock be in an uptrend and
while it has been correctly stated that “You can’t have a bullish rever-
sal pattern in an uptrend,” this is a technical exception. A bullish
uptrend that takes many days to cycle from support to resistance is
essentially made up of mini uptrends and retracements that preserve
a bullish pattern. Each leg of the trend may be long enough for legit-
imate bullish and bearish reversals (see Figure 10-23).

years of study and use trumps Western bar charts in a big
way, but the candle patterns are shortsighted.

• Trends are made up of retracements. At support, reversal
patterns keep a trend going while continuation patterns
can end it.
• Playing a trend is different than playing the cycles of a
trend. Playing the trend follows the trend direction by
watching for a retracement to continue down through sup-
port. Playing the cycles of a trend will require looking for
reversals at support and resistance to keep the trend going.
• The length of the cycle determines whether it is appropri-
ate to use reversal patterns.
• The Western Pattern Charts do a great job of showing the
potential homebuyers arriving at the Open House, the
Japanese Candlesticks can signal how anxious they are
to buy.

THE MESSAGE
What’s in a Name?
There are five different species of skunk in North America: the
Striped Skunk, Eastern Spotted Skunk, Western Spotted Skunk, Hog-
nose Skunk, and the Hooded Skunk. They all do the same thing when
they are surprised or feel threatened. So if a hiker happens upon a
small, white-striped black mammal that spins its business end around
it is not the time to pause and wonder if it is a Western or Eastern
Spotted. It does not matter which species, the message is same for all
of the skunks: run!
Likewise, there are a lot of candlestick patterns and many are vari-
ations on common messages. Hesitation signals have many names,
but it is more important to recognize the message than remember the
name. When it gets right down to it there is far too much emphasis
placed on the proper name recognition and not enough on really
knowing the implications of the candlestick message.
Daunting tasks tend to discourage folks, and memorizing the
names, variations, and rules for 80+ candlestick patterns and signals
is a daunting task. Fortunately that level of memorizing is not
required to gain functional skills in the use of candlesticks. This
chapter will give some rules and tools to help simplify and speed the
quest for proficiency. This foundation will also expand candlestick
knowledge and skills over time.
What’s a Good One?
Read a book, visit a Web site, pop into a chat room about candle-
sticks and someone will ask the question “What’s a really good rever-
sal pattern?” A good one? Consider the ambiguity of the question.
What does good mean? They may be justified in wanting someone to

Chapter Ten
save them a lot of time by listing the best three or four patterns, but
it is a bad question. What do they want to know, the best reversal or
continuation patterns, and what do they mean by good, and how
good is good enough?
A so called “good one” may be significantly enhanced or dimin-
ished depending on its location because reversal signals predict better
at support or resistance levels. Every pattern or signal has a message
because it describes varied behavior.
“Good ones” can also be underappreciated if taken out of context;
redefining what a “good one” is will enhance the ability to read and
place the message in perspective, and having sound accuracy data
may change many traditional views on which patterns are “good
ones.”
The first step is recognizing the candlestick message and then weigh-
ing its relevance and significance by the location.
Short Days
A small, tiny, or no body day, like a Hammer or a Doji, has a very
specific message. In tests using millions of days of data, the Doji as
well as small and tiny body patterns showed accuracy rates of 50%
(+/−). 50% is not very impressive, but those small days are 100%
accurate at predicting indecision. A lack of momentum or news can
cause consolidation and confusion, and small bodies show either a
volatile or apathetic lack of momentum (see Figure 10-24). Because
every reversal has to lose traction and stop before it changes direc-
tion, turns are either decisive or deliberated. The deliberation is often
punctuated by an indecisive day or two.
If the stock loses traction at a pivot point, whether the stock moves
up or down is less important than the fact that the trade has lost trac-
tion at a significant price. The traders know where they are and are
trying to determine the sentiment of the market. The ubiquitous

50/50 indecision signal is doing exactly what it is supposed to do,
and at support or resistance, it can be a million-watt beacon (see Fig-
ure 10-25).
If the indecision at a pivot point is followed by a continuation
breakout, the small body would have failed to predict a reversal but
succeeded with honors at predicting where to set up for a trade (see
Figure 10-26). The indecisive message was clear and relevant. Which-
ever direction is taken after the hesitation is significant and under-
scores the need for a trader to be neutral and flexible.

dashed by misunderstanding the message of these Long Days. It may
seem obvious that a Long Day should give a very bullish or very bear-
ish signal but what follows often catches traders off guard.
The message is strong, but Long Days invite challenges like a new
kid on the playground. It is very common to see two to four days of
testing and challenge after a Long Day. The Rising and Falling Three
Method continuation patterns are formed when the direction re-
sumes after an unsuccessful challenge to a Long Day (see Figures
10-27 and 10-28). A Long Day in the direction of a trend is a good
signal, but the message includes a warning about getting too close
with stops.
Trading Tip
If the trader is to follow the trend, it may be necessary to leave the
gains of the Long Day exposed until the trend resumes. New traders
often move in to protect profits, and get bounced, only to see the
trend continue. Most traders do not have the experience or courage
to jump back in and often watch on the sidelines, feeling betrayed,
as the trend moves on without them. The message did not betray
them; in fact the message was clear and correct, but a lack of can-
dlestick knowledge and natural market behavior drew them too
close to the flame.

Note that the Rising and Falling Three method patterns are 50%
accurate, which means that location may play a large part in strategy.
If day one moves to a pivot point or price target, the trader may do
well to jamb the stop in tight because waiting for a few days with just
a 50% chance it will continue is a threat to a target already reached.
If a long body candle moves in favor of the trade, but is not near the
target, it makes sense to hang back at the open of day one to see if the
momentum continues.
More Complex Patterns
Often it takes more than one day to form a consensus among the
traders and the market. A four- to six-day pattern indicates it took
the traders a while to reach a consensus of market sentiment. Each

day is a separate message, and by the time the pattern is completed
the reversal may be well underway. The trader trying to read each
day while waiting for the pattern to confirm may find the ideal entry
happened several days before (see Figure 10-29). The correct entry is
signaled as the stock moves away from support or resistance level.
When the complex pattern completes, it gives good confirmation to
a trade that should have already been entered. Confirmation is great,
but it is not necessary to wait for a complex pattern to complete
before entering a trade.
Trading Tip
An entry point that is clear but not confirmed can be entered by tak-
ing a small position and adding when and if confirmation occurs. If
the move is a “Head Fake” it has little consequence and the correct
trade can then be made.
Accuracy versus Frequency (Surprises)
The more complex patterns have generally been thought to be more
accurate, and some research supports that premise when they are

observed at specific support and resistance areas, but the data runs
by Greg Morris, elsewhere in this book, have yielded some profound
revelations. Some of the simpler patterns have some of the highest
accuracy ratings. Some of the complex patterns may be more accu-
rate but they are also much less frequent, so most reversals will be
associated with the simpler one- to three-day patterns. Therefore the
simpler, more frequent candle patterns will be the dominant reversal
signals in most trades (see Figure 10-30).

Finding a stock at a pivot point and correctly reading the candle-
stick message is what really counts. The accuracy rating and charac-
teristics of the pattern are valuable, but the crux of the matter is
established by the location. Some may be disappointed, but accuracy
is not quite as important as it may have once seemed, which lessens
the urgency to find the “Good Ones.”
Direction of the Tails
One very fascinating correlation that has emerged from the new data
runs in this book involves four very familiar and similar candles. The

Hammer, Hanging Man, Shooting Star, Inverted Hammer, and their
cousins (Umbrellas and Long Legged Doji) have traditionally shared
roughly equal value in predicting reversals. The Hammer and Hang-
ing Man are particularly popular and many books and Web sites
treat them as “good ones.” However, like many stereotypes, assump-
tions about these candles wither under recent scrutiny, and when
they are properly analyzed and compared, an intriguing relationship
shows up.
Long-tailed patterns either point in the direction of, or the reverse
of, a trend, and the millions of days that were scanned for this data-
base reveal that the direction of the tails has a strong correlation to
the accuracy of the reversal signals they predict (see Figure 10-31).
Figure 10-31

==================================================

(cid:2) 430
Chapter Ten
The Hanging Man and the Inverted Hammer have substantially
higher (63% and 62%) accuracy percentages than the Hammer and
Shooting Star (44% and 48%). Far from the assumption that small-
bodied, long-tailed candles were very comparable, the Hanging
Man and Inverted Hammer had a 19- and 14-point advantage re-
spectively. It is a fair conclusion that in small body patterns, the
body size has much less to do with accuracy of the reversal than the
tail. Small bodies, tiny bodies, and Dojis should yield similar re-
sults to Figure 10-32 if they have long tails and are in similar posi-
tions.
Note that the percentages used are the average of each pattern’s
accuracy over one through seven days of follow-through, therefore
the percentages for comparing patterns is not supposed to add up
to 100%.
The message is profound. Of these “good ones,” the venerable
Hammer pattern rests just four places off the bottom of 90 patterns
tested, while the Hanging Man stands at number two in the accuracy
ratings. The direction of the long tail substantially influences the
probability of a reversal.
The frequency ratio also provides an interesting side note. The
bearish reversal Hanging Man (accuracy winner), occurred 30 times
more often than it’s companion bearish reversal the Shooting Star.
The bullish reversal Hammer (accuracy loser) occurred five times
more often than the bullish reversal Inverted Hammer. Thus, there
will likely be more Hammers at support, and more Hanging Man
patterns at resistance, but equal weighting can no longer be a given
(see Figure 10-32). So at resistance, the more frequent Hanging Man
is much more accurate than the Shooting Star and at support, the
more frequent Hammer is far less accurate than the Inverted Ham-
mer. All that said, remember the influence of location. There are a lot
of Hammers, and cursory observations suggest a much higher accu-
racy at pivot points.

Reciprocals
A reciprocal has the opposite construction and message, and the vast
majority of candle patterns have reciprocal patterns with opposite
messages (see Figure 10-33). Most reciprocal patterns have very sim-
ilar accuracy percentages, but there are several exceptions that
traders need to be aware of.
In the prior discussion, the bearish reversal Hanging Man showed
a substantial 19-point (63% to 44%) advantage over the bullish
reversal Hammer, but the reciprocal of the Hanging Man is the
Inverted Hammer, not the Hammer. The Hanging Man and Hammer
were compared because they are so widely associated with reversals
and happen at both support and resistance. They are clones, not
reciprocals, and the big discrepancy in accuracy is surprising, but the

Hanging Man actually compares very favorably with its reciprocal
the Inverted Hammer, and the Hammer compares nicely with its
reciprocal the Shooting Star (see Figure 10-34).
Some 90 patterns were tested, of which 88 were generated from 44
reciprocal pairs. Only seven reciprocal patterns had five or more
points discrepancy in the accuracy percentages. Thirty-four varied by
four or less points and three were exactly equal (See Figure 10-35).
Seven out of seven big discrepancy (more than 5%) patterns had
much higher bullish accuracy percentages than bearish (see Figure
10-36). This was a surprise advantage to the bullish patterns.

In the past, there has been a subtle presumption that bearish rever-
sal patterns had an edge based on the general perception that it is
harder to push a price up than to drive it down. The data shows that
33 out of 44 pairs favored the bullish signals, eight favored the bear-
ish signals, and three had the same percentage (Figure 10-37). Hard
data suggest that bullish patterns outperform their bearish recipro-
cals in a big way, and 100% of the big accuracy discrepancy pairs
favor the bullish reversals.

50% Does Not Equal 50/50
The 50%+/− accuracy of simple candle patterns is augmented by the
100% indecision they suggest, but 50% does not equate to a 50/50
chance of reversal. It may appear that the accuracy numbers are hud-
dled in an insignificant midrange and if there were only two directions
a stock could go, it would be a fair observation. It is tempting to
equate 50% with 50/50, but there are actually three directions a chart
may go; up, down and sideways. This changes the picture a great deal
(see Figure 10-38). If the signal is only about 50% accurate at pre-
dicting a reversal, the 50% chance it will not reverse is split between
continuing and going sideways. Therefore the odds are greater that it
will reverse than either go sideways or continue.
An options trader considering a spread (like a Bear Call Spread)
hopes a stock will stay at or below a certain price to gain the maxi-
mum profit. The trade setup would be a stock stalling at a resistance
level or threatening to drop through support. If the stock throws a

Doji, Hanging Man, Shooting star, Spinning Top, or some other inde-
cision candle, the message is indecision and loss of traction at a pivot
point. Now the accuracy rate for a simple reversal signal is about
50% (48% to 63%), but the odds that the spread trade will work are
greater than that. Going sideways also works for the spread, so the
50%+reversal plus the chance it goes sideways (whatever percentage
that is), makes it much greater than 50/50 that the Bear Call Spread
will work favorably (see Figure 10-39).

Trading Tip
The presence of indecisive signals at pivot points enhances the odds
for some trades. The trader has a clear exit criteria defined by the
resistance and the presence of the small body reversal signals. The
trade has a much greater than 50% chance that an appropriate
spread trade will work.
Bodies and Tails/Priority and Message,
Sentiment versus Volatility
The message of every pattern builds off the message of each day,
which is made up of a body (difference between open and close), and
tail/wick/shadow (the high and low). The bodies take priority over
the tails for the first read when evaluating and interpreting the can-
dle message.
The body signal represents the sentiment of the day, the overall dis-
position after the smoke clears. Was the body small, normal, or large?
Was it bullish or bearish and if so how bullish or bearish? The final
score of a game determines a winner or loser but the score does not
always tell the story of the game (see composition, later in this chapter).
The tails represent the volatility of the day and confirm how hard
it was to reach a consensus. Long tails can be news related or just
lack of cohesion among the traders, but they suggest wide divergence
of opinion and emotion. Shorter tails confirm and support the mes-
sage of the body. Either way, tails increase or decrease the volatility
of the day’s action and reveal a lot about how the day’s sentiment
was reached (see Figures 10-40 and 10-41).
Gaps
Gaps are pricing phenomena that need a brief mention. A true gap is
a rare and significant event (see Figure 10-42) that often accompanies
strong price moves. A gap can punctuate a reversal as it signals a

strong sentiment at a pivot point. While this section is not a thorough
discussion of the Gap Theory, candles can be shown to help a great
deal in reading the importance of a gap.
There are several gap patterns, but the underlying message of gaps
is this:
1. A gap is a change of opinion about the price while the mar-
ket has been closed. The opening price is higher or lower
than the previous day’s close.
2. The longer the gap stays open, the more significant it is.
3. Gaps happen a lot and only rarely are they still open at the
end of the day.
4. How a gap is filled can help to read the sentiment of the
market.

Candlesticks for Traders
Trading Tip
Over 90% of gaps are filled by the end of the trading day. Therefore
an opening gap will almost always fill, and how it fills is important.
If the candle reaches back to fill the gap and then continues on the
direction of the gap, the message is very confirming of the gap direc-
tion. If a gap trades back to fill, and closes near or inside the previ-
ous day, it is often a reversal signal (see Figure 10-43). The gap is a
change in valuation, and how the traders react is key to understand-
ing how significant the gap is.
The true gap is rare and often several days go by with out filling
the gap. The most significant gaps can take weeks, months, and even
years to fill. How a gap fills is important to candlestick traders; does
the stock reach back intraday with a long tail and then reverse away
like a child playing “Ring and Run” with a doorbell, or do they park

precisely at the gap and take off the next day? Do they arrive clum-
sily and or just plow on through (see Figure 10-44).
This behavior sends vital messages, and most gaps are treated like
wrapping up loose ends. Knowing how the traders feel about a par-
ticular gap and how to read the message of the candles is the key to
that advantage.
Perspective
First of all, the message of each day must be understood or it is not
possible to put blended signals together. Yes, patterns can be memo-

rized but the patterns do not have high enough accuracy rates to be
traded alone. Location has been shown to enhance accuracy but it
remains necessary to be flexible and neutral at pivot points. The can-
dle signals will add weight and commitment to the trade, but they
will not make the trade.
A stock or market movement reflects human nature, which at best
is predictably fickle. Like reading a person’s body language when
they are asked to give a speech, one may look nervous or confident
but that does not determine how effective the speech will be.
The approach to a support or resistance level must be looked at for
what it is. Key traders are nudging the stock toward a significant
price level, and a generic analogy may help to put “the message” in
perspective.
A competitive team moves through a season toward the playoffs
and hopefully the finals and a championship. The team is having a
winning season and the margin of victory is solid each game. The
coach is happy and confident. The candle bodies show a win (open
bodies) or loss (closed body). Tails pointing down show how far
behind the team got during the game and up tails show how much
of a lead they gave up. Look at a few different approaches to
the playoffs and try to understand how the coach feels (see Figure
10-45).
Although a win is a win, the coach does not see each approach the
same way. The team may arrive having lost momentum or they may
get there at the top of their game, and it does reflect how they may
perform in the crucial playoffs. In the playoffs, only a few games can
be lost and still advance. The team may get bumped out in the first
round or hang on until the last game. They may win every game to
jump ahead or have to fight to come from behind. Quick and decisive
or slow and brutal, the sentiment will be reached and the team will
either advance to the championship rounds or be sent packing (see
Figure 10-46).

Two hundred years of observation and study have produced candle-

movement. That research must be respected and valued, but the
importance of location and understanding the message gives further
perspective and utility. One additional examination will further
refine the use and interpretation of candlestick signals.

sentiments and attitudes, the way that an individual candle is formed

first mile of a two-mile race; one is exhausted and the other looks
fresh. The net result is they both finished but there is a clue as to how
they will do in the second half. A single candle may have a name and
an expectation, but how it is likely to behave tomorrow may depend
on how it was formed.
A hammer pattern shows the recovery of a significant sell-off at
support. The sell-off indicates that sellers drove the price hard at sup-
port but buyers bought up the bargain. The indecision is clear but the
fact that buyers came back at support gives credence to the idea that
the support may hold. OK, the historical accuracy of a Hammer pat-
tern is 42% (better at support), but more light can be shed on this
message of indecision.

The intraday composition of the Hammer can send significantly
different signals (see Figure 10-47). The rally of buyers could be
strong or weak, and it could have happened at the end or beginning
of the day. The stock may have been buying or selling or languish-
ing at the closing bell. Day traders know all too well that the senti-
ment at the end of the day often carries over to the next morning.
Trading Tip
At crucial pivot points, a trader wants to have any clues about how
the stock may follow through in the morning. Noting the candle’s
composition may give some very helpful hints as to what comes
next. Intraday charts are needed to evaluate the daily composition,
but they do not have to be real time. Free delayed intraday charts
areavailableontheInternet.Sometimesalookattheintradaycom-
position can adjust the next day’s trading plan in a crucial way.
Summary for The Message
A candlestick signal is interpreted in an aggregate of all the occur-
rences observed over a long time. This produces generalizations that
are good, but fine-tuning the signal by looking at its message, loca-
tion, and composition may add weight and clarify the probable fol-
low-through.

FAMILY TIES
Once a trader can recognize the message of a single day, understand-
ing patterns becomes easier because it is no longer an abstract, rote
memorization. When the message of a pattern makes sense, similar
patterns come to mind more readily.
This section may prove to be a big help to learning and remem-
bering candle patterns. The full definitions of the candle patterns
have been previously laid out in this book, so the illustrations and
references to the patterns are for recognition and comparative pur-

poses only. Most patterns have some flexibility so that many illustra-
tions would be required to show all the variations possible. Again,
where pattern rules or detail may seem needed, please refer to the
ample explanations elsewhere of the candle pattern rules.
Learning candle patterns in groups is much like recognizing family
members. If a large number of relatives were disbursed in a crowd of
strangers it would be easy to miss them. However, if the relatives
were all brought forward and arranged by families units it would
become rather easy to spot them, even if they were dispersed back
into the crowd again.
Candlesticks, like relatives, can be grouped together and learned
in family groups. They can be directly related or cousins. As in any
family some of the cousins can be a bit odd, but in perspective they
still fit and are much easier to remember if they can be placed into a
family.
Candlestick patterns have very strict definitions, but there are
many variations to the named patterns, and the Japanese did not give
names to patterns that were “really close.” Experience and common
sense allow traders to read the message even if it does not exactly
match the picture or definition in the book.
Hesitation signals have already been discussed elsewhere, and
their characteristics are small bodies with tails of varying size repre-
senting volatility. Some have names and others do not but the mes-
sage is obvious.
The majority of the one-day patterns do not strictly qualify for a
name but it does not change their message. Trying to decide if a can-
dle is a true Hammer or just a really close nameless cousin is point-
less (see Figure 10-48). Classic indecision patterns like the Hammer
and Doji Star have names and strict definitions for a reason, and they
may be a bit more significant than their unnamed cousins, but so
what? “. . . umm, let’s see, is that a Western or and Eastern Spotted
Skunk?”

The One-Day Family
The most obvious example of familial relationship may be too subtle
to recognize at first. It is the transition between a Bullish and Bearish
Marabozu. At each end of this family group stand towering candle-
sticks. The Japanese term Marabozu refers to a monk sitting in the
lotus position (see Figure 10-49). Viewed from behind, they sit sol-
idly on flat ground and their shaved heads are smooth on top.

==================================================

(cid:2) 450
Chapter Ten
The Marabozu pattern is considered to be the strongest single-day
pattern and is either very bullish or very bearish. The lack of any
shadow indicates the sentiment was very strong and the traders
reached a sold consensus.
The message from tails can be confusing, but put in proper
sequence it makes sense. For example, a Bullish Marabozu has no
extended tails. Adding a tail to the top creates an Opening Marabozu,
and adding a tail to the bottom creates a Closing Marabozu signal. It
can make a difference which end has the tail, especially at pivot points
(see Figure 10-50). A tail at the bottom suggests an attempted sell-off
at the open that was overcome and followed by strong buying which
closed at the high of the day. A tail at the top suggests a strong
unequivocal start but some backing away from the highs of the day.
The stronger signal comes from the ending, not the beginning of the
day, because how a big day finishes carries more weight than how it
began.

Candlesticks for Traders
Marabozu signals are found in several patterns. A few examples
are Belt Hold, On Neck, In Neck, Separating Lines, Kicking, as well
as several Tweezer patterns (see Figure 10-51).
The transition between the bullish and bearish Marabozu is like
hiking between two peaks. There are many routes down and up the
other side, and in the middle is a flat valley. The most neutral and
indecisive pattern (the Four Point Doji), lies on the valley floor. The
Four Point Doji is theoretical because it implies the stock opened,
closed at the high and low of the day, which implies it did not trade.
The Doji Star is likely the most indecisive pattern that will be seen.
Every single candlestick falls into this extended family and it helps
to see them in the big picture. Starting with a Bullish Marabozu
where complete consensus is obvious, adding tails and or reducing

the body size begins to weaken the sentiment and add volatility end-
ing with the Doji star (see Figure 10-52).
Moving past the middle, the bodies are closed and as they get big-
ger the sentiment firms up and tails gradually lose their significance.
The signals firm and finally the bearish Marabozu is reached (see Fig-
ure 10-53).
Body Size: How Big Is Big?
The Japanese refer to Long, Normal, and Short days and there are
definitions for these distinctions, but common sense will suffice for

most traders. A look back over the last few weeks should make it
obvious what constitutes a large, normal, or small day. Small means
just that, small, and tiny would be in between small and no body at
all, or Doji.
Body Color
Big bodies are very significant and so their color is significant. As the
bodies get smaller the sentiment weakens and the color becomes
much less important. Very small bodies do not carry any significant
color bias.
Tails add volatility, and a whole raft of one-day patterns blend into
a blur of indecision. Some have names, many do not, but all are
screaming the same warning (see Figure 10-54). There are many
more variations that could occur, but in the muddle of the middle,
color and/or name do not mean much.
Splitting Hairs

between an “A” and a “B.” There are candle patterns that could raise

the same argument. Certain reversal and continuation patterns are
very similar, and only slight variations dictate that one is a reversal
and the other is a continuation pattern. The Thrusting +and Piercing
Line patterns are a good example. Along with their respective recip-
rocal patterns are Thrusting −and Dark Cloud Cover (see Figure 10-
55). The Thrusting (continuation) and Piercing Line (reversal)
patterns are only separated by whether the rising second day closes
above the midpoint of day, but 200 years of experience has deter-
mined that it is significant. The average accuracy percentages show
how the significance of the signals can get fuzzy.
Most texts do not place these four patterns side by side, but they

should be associated and identified as the transition between contin-
uation and reversal in a family group.
The Thrusting − and Thrusting + are reciprocals, but both are re-
versal patterns. It is generally easier to roll a rock downhill than to
push it uphill, and so while the Thrusting patterns are exact recipro-
cals, at resistance the Thrusting − pattern is not likely to continue.
Confirmation
A common element of pattern definition is confirmation. Confirma-
tion may be suggested or required or not needed. Confirmation re-
flects the level of confidence or implied probability that a pattern will
follow through with its predicted outcome. An indecisive signal does
not need confirmation, so it is the reversal and continuation patterns
that will refer to a level of confirmation needed to bolster their respec-
tive predictions.
It is fine to apply the suggested level of confirmation to a pattern,
but it is very interesting to see why one pattern needs it more than
another. To see why patterns have different needs for confirmation, it
is necessary to understand the breakdown or reduction of patterns.
Breakdown and Reduction of Multiple Line Patterns
Many years ago, Greg Morris demonstrated how two- and three-day
patterns reduce to a simple one-day message. This information has
been included in earlier chapters, but it will be enlightening to go
through a comparative example showing the resolution of an Out-
side and Inside Day pattern.
Outside Day
The very common Bullish Engulfing pattern is an Outside Day Pat-
tern made up of a Long Closed Day in a downtrend, followed by an
even larger Open Day. Day two opens below the close of day one,



==================================================

==================================================

(cid:2) 456
Chapter Ten

and closes above the open of day one. The reduction is done by con-
structing a single candle from the open of day one, the high and low
of either day, and the close of day two. The Bullish Engulfing deliv-
ers an impressive show of force, but the pattern reduces anywhere
from an indecisive Hammer to a long-legged Dragon Fly Doji de-
pending on where day two closed. (See Figure 10-56.)
The signal is very clear because there is very little flexibility in the
pattern. The downside selling pressure dried up in a dramatic way. A
strong buying spree stopped the bearish slide, and if it happened at
known support, it was even more significant. If a third day follows
through to the upside and closes above the close of day two, the inde-
cision is resolved and a strong bullish reversal has been signaled (see
Figure 10-57). This pattern is called Three Outside Up, and looking

457 (cid:2)
Candlesticks for Traders
at the construction it makes sense: Three (days), Outside (day two is
an outside day), up (it resolves to the upside).
Confirmation can now be used as a powerful and comparative
tool. The most common two-day reversal patterns are the Engulfing
and Harami patterns. The Harami patterns require confirmation but
the Engulfing patterns do not. The shape of the two patterns suggests
an obvious reason because the Engulfing looks more decisive than
the Harami. The observation is right but the reason is not as obvious
as it looks. There is a deeper and more complex reason that only
reveals itself with comparative reduction of the patterns.
Inside Days
The Harami pattern is the classic Inside Day pattern. It begins with a
Long Day in the direction of a current price trend followed by a small
body inside day. The body of day two may touch either the open or
close of day one but not both. It can be either open or closed but the
opposite of day one is more supportive of the pattern. The Bullish
and Bearish Harami reduce down to a wide range of signals from a
Long Legged Doji to a big-bodied bullish or bearish day. Unlike the
Engulfing pattern, there are many variations to the Harami, which
hardly makes for a cohesive or consistent message.
Examining the two patterns together, it is clear why the Harami
needs confirmation; without confirmation, the Harami can send a
wide variety of signals. Here is a look at the Bearish Harami and
Engulfing reductions (see Figure 10-58). The Harami takes three
days at best to create the same signal as Engulfing creates on day two.
The small body on day two stops progress, but the reversal mes-
sage may be much less probable than the Engulfing pattern.
Adding a third day of confirmation has an interesting effect on the
Bearish Harami. The confirmation day is an open day that opens
inside day one, and closes above the close of day one. This reduces

Chapter Ten

the Harami to the same signal the Engulfing pattern had on day two.
The fact that it took three days may weaken the signal somewhat (see
Figure 10-59). The Harami with confirmation has a new name,
Three Inside Up, an odd name that should now makes perfect sense:
Three (three days), Inside (an inside day), Up (resolved to the upside).
The intraday movement that forms a candle was discussed in the
previous section. Variations on the way the day develops can color
the message. It is very similar to reversal patterns and demonstrates
why some patterns need further confirmation to strengthen their
signal.

Approach and Follow-Through
There are many candle patterns that describe the way a price trend
approaches support or resistance. This was previously compared to a
coach watching a team make its way to the playoffs. The patterns
may suggest a reversal or continuation or indecision, and most pat-
terns have a reciprocal with the opposite message. Here the approach
patterns will be broken down into five groups. Groups one and five
reflect very strong reversal and continuation sentiment; while groups
two and three are reversals, and group four contains most of the con-
tinuation patterns. The distribution and number of patterns in each
group back up the generalization that most candle patterns are rever-
sals. Because most reversals happen at support or resistance levels
(whether the trader can see it or not), knowing the likely pivot point
(being able to read a chart) allows a trader to watch the approach
and evaluate it as it happens.
The names of the five groups have been borrowed from basketball
and will be explained: “steal,” “turnover,” “over and back,” “head
fake,” and “fast break.” They reflect the way the patterns behave as
they encounter support or resistance (see Figure 10-60). The focus

must be placed on being aware of the location and interpreting the
message in context. The candles may not be perfect but they are try-
ing to tell a story, so it is very important to learn to read the message
and understand what the possible implications are. That knock on the
door may be the Big Bad Wolf or Ed McMahon with the Publisher’s
Clearinghouse check. But the fact remains—someone is at the door.
Steal
Stealing the ball suddenly gives the momentum to the other team.
This approach pattern suggests a volatile change of sentiment as the
price reached a pivot point. A line chart would show this approach as
a miss because the line would stop short of the pivot point and
reverse away (see Figure 10-61). These signals are generally long tail
candles that reach up or down to the pivot point and close moving
off in the opposite direction. This approach can frustrate traders
waiting for the stock to arrive and park at the pivot point.
This “drive by” opportunity is only available to those who can see
the support or resistance level, and have a Trailing Stop or some alert
set to activate whenever the stock arrives. If it is an intraday event, it
will be missed by a lot of traders. Nonetheless, it will make perfect

sense after the fact and the long tail will tell the story, “Hey, we
stopped by but no one was home. Too bad.”
A big gap to the support or resistance level can also reverse away
when market makers miscalculate the right place to open a stock (see
Figure 10-62). This is a very volatile day and after the dust settles
there is a big question about the way the news was treated and often
the selling continues.
Turnover
A turnover gives the ball to the other team. Most turnovers are han-
dled by the referee and happen after a goal or a foul. These patterns
arrive at the pivot point and then reverse without any equivocation
(see Figures 10-63 and 10-64). This is the largest of the five groups of
patterns and this group tends to come to a stop and make a solid
turn. The “turnover” group includes one- to five-day patterns and is
a simpler group of patterns to play, as they tend to march up to pivot
points, salute, and then reverse.

It is not a perfect analogy, but this group gaps or probes across
the pivot point and then returns. It almost suggests an “oops”
or “just kidding” kind of move. A few continuation patterns show
up in this group, but most reverse after the errant foray across the
line.
Gaps Are Common in Group Four and Five
The over and back patterns can also have long tails (Shooting
Stars and Hammer patterns) that act like scouting parties. Intra-
day they may shoot across the support or resistance line and come
back. The signal often plays out as if they came back saying
“Whoa, I don’t think we want to go there” (see Figures 10-65 and
10-66). Several patterns can fit in both turnovers and over and
back patterns.

Head Fake
A good shooter can pull up and look like they are going to stop and
then accelerate past the opponent who “bought the fake.” This
group is a made up of continuation patterns that start out as a break-
out move followed by a convincing reversal. Traders can get whip-
shawed here by stopping out on the reversal (which they should
have), and then watching in frustration as the trade continues in the
original direction. The problem was not being stopped out; the prob-
lem for traders is sitting there feeling sorry for themselves while a
perfectly normal market move takes place (see Figure 10-67). Know-
ing this can happen and what it looks like allows the traders to
switch at the right spot and get on with the right trade.
Head fakes can be really convincing and a good trader knows the

initial reversal may or may not keep going and makes the trade with
that in mind. If it keeps going, they are in the right trade, and if it
reverses again, they recognize it and switch stop rather than quit and
feel abused. In street basketball, the term used is being “shook,” and
many traders have felt “shaken” out of trades that they should have
stayed in.
It is important to learn this group well because they are multiday
patterns that can give confusing signals. Learning these patterns will
help to avoid whipsaws and frustration because continuation pat-
terns are failed reversals. These patterns tend to look like the letter N
because they move over the line (support and or resistance), come
back like the over and back group, and then plow ahead in the orig-
inal direction. This group also features the gaps that are strong
enough to keep going (see Figure 10-68).

This is a small group because a strong candle (like a large bull-

to name, and gaps that do not look back are rare and obvious.

The names are few at either end of the group list (one and five),
which underscores the idea that traders tend to know where the sup-
port and resistance levels are. There is usually some level of contest
before reaching consensus, and the contest at support and resistance
can be over quickly or long and hard fought. Groups one and five
would be exceptions and might represent forfeiting. To group one,
the other guys were just “too scary” so they gave in and backed
away. To group five, the other team just gave up and offered little or
no resistance, but the majority of the time (groups two, three, and
four), gaining a consensus at pivot points requires putting the ball on
the court and playing a game.
Extended Families
Extended families have many different subcategories: cousins, aunts,
male grandchildren, etc., and the analogy can extend to candlesticks
quite well. Space and time dictate that not every family relationship
will be addressed here; however, the reader may want to use the fol-
lowing format to explore additional familial relationships.
The example here is set at support and deals with as many candles
as possible in a modified family tree. A downtrend is assumed and a
support level has been reached. While it is not possible to be as accu-
rate as a genus flow chart that an anthropologist might use, it is a
very good overview and the reader is free to draw additional rela-
tionship correlations (see Figure 10-71). The layout is built on a hor-
izontal sequence moving left to right. Starting with a Harami R+
(Bullish Reversal Harami), it ends with Three Outside Up R+. There
is some similarity to the earlier description of the Five Approaches,
but here the related patterns include reversals and continuation pat-
terns. Each pattern on the center line sequence is a slight variation to
the one on its left. Related patterns (if there are any) branch off either
up or down and are labeled as R+ (Bullish Reversal) or C− (Bearish

Continuation). Space constraints kept additional data (like accuracy
%) from being displayed. Individual data is best reviewed in Greg
Morris’s individual pattern analysis and summary graphics.
The value of this chart is the visual proximity of the related patterns.
It may seem a bit jumbled at first but that is also its strength. The vast
majority of people gain a great deal from a picture, and often a good
picture keeps revealing hidden gems upon repeated study. After some
time spent getting used to the names and shapes of the patterns, the
familial relationship should begin to make sense. Each section or
group that becomes familiar becomes a building block. The variations
are fairly slight in many cases, and sometimes just a slight variation
makes the difference between a reversal and continuation pattern.
Many single-line candles are missing, but related patterns are there
and it should be easy to figure out where they could be placed. For
example, a long-legged Doji is a variation of the Hammer and
Inverted Hammer on the chart. The long-legged Doji would just be a
more volatile and indecisive variant.
Cousins
It is helpful to continue to look for correlations, characteristics, and
similarities that make it easier to remember patterns. The concept of
cousins has been introduced earlier in the discussion of Haramis and
Engulfing patterns with their respective confirmations, partly because
they are the most common patterns traders will run into, but it is a
concept that can now be broadened a bit. This is intended to spur the
reader on to look for and recognize relationships and correlations in
familial patterns. In other words this is the start, not the end.
Gaps
A quick reminder here that gaps are not all the same. True Gaps
leave a hole in the trading at the end of the day and neither the

body nor the tails of the previous and current day will overlap.

of the day (see Figure 10-72). Certainly not all gap patterns happen
at pivot points but many do and are often part of more complex
patterns.
The fact is, over 90% of gaps fill the same day they happen, so true
gaps are very rare. The fact that the price gapped carries a major mes-
sage at the open, but how it behaves (stays open, overlaps the tails or
fills) tells the real value of the gap. True gaps tend to be continuation
signals and if they jump across support or resistance lines it signals a
strong possibility of a continuation. Body gaps and opening gaps are
not as strong as true gaps and are very often part of reversal patterns
(see Figure 10-73). Candle pattern gaps are either filled or left open.

The true gaps left open are almost all continuation patterns, while
the filled gaps tend to be reversals.
Tweezers
A pair of tweezers meets together at a common point (see Figure
10-74), and a few candle patterns involve Tweezer configurations.

Tweezers is more a concept than a set of patterns. In general when a
stock recognizes a price level from a previous day, it implies that the
traders are still aware of that reversal point. It is only common sense
that the more attention that is placed on a price, the more significant
it may be.
Trading Tip
Often tweezers are part of reversal patterns, but there is caveat here
to remember. Many stocks routinely open at the same price they
closed at the day before. Reading Tweezers requires putting them
into context, and like gaps that happen too often to have any rele-
vance, high-frequency Tweezers equal irrelevance.
Here are a few patterns that include a Tweezers as part of their
configuration (see Figure 10-75).
Inside and Outside Day Families
The inside day and outside days are different reversal signals that can
reduce to many different messages, from strong reversal to indeci-

sion, and when confirmed they both have the same message. But
there are related patterns that make the transition between inside and
outside days (see Figure 10-76). Again, for space reasons, only the
Bullish reversal will be shown. The reciprocals will have the opposite
message.
The Harami pattern shows hesitation by throwing a smaller inside
day. The large first day is a statement day, and hesitation of the

Harami requires confirmation or capitulation. The confirmation
comes with the Three Inside Up and capitulation comes with Falling
Three method. The One White Soldier is one of many variations that
trace back to the Harami (see Figure 10-77).
The Three Outside Up is the confirmation of the Bullish Engulfing,
and while the accuracy goes up a few points, the reduction does not

get that much more bullish. The last two days of the pattern would
reduce to a very large bullish candle, but the net is still hesitation. A
third bullish day could produce the Three White Soldiers pattern,
which reduces to a very large bullish day and the accuracy jumps up
again. The Three Line Strike reduces four days to the same signal as
the Engulfing. This engulfs all in one day. Somehow this reflects an
anomaly and the odds are that this Engulfing Day will be followed by
bearish continuation instead of a bullish reversal (See Figure 10-78).

Finally, here are a few of the complex (three to five days) patterns
with their accuracy percentages. The disproportionate number of
reversal patterns is typical. It is interesting that almost all reduce to
some variation of a Hammer line (see Figure 10-79).
Trading Tip
The Three Line Strike reminds traders not to bite too hard on big
one-day reversals, but if the stock was at support, closing the bearish
trade and or starting a bullish one on the bounce is totally appropri-
ate. Knowing the pattern would then dictate waiting to see if it pulled
back to test support again. Worst case, the trader gets to add to the

trade if it bounces and switch to a bearish continuation if it drops on
through. Win-win.
Summary for Family Ties
Like the illumination that charts brought to the mental darkrooms of
ticker tape reading, candlesticks have broadened the trader’s vision
of market temperament and pattern recognition. However, as stated
at the very beginning, understanding and effectively utilizing candle-
sticks is a far cry from knowing a few names and searching to find
“the good ones.” New black-belts in any martial art find that they
have worked very hard and progressed to an important milestone. In
fact it is the point where their instructors inform them that their jour-
ney is about to begin. Their efforts have properly prepared them to
now really learn the art.

CHAPTER ELEVEN
Conclusions
Successful analysis of the stock and futures markets is not an easy
task. Most participants prepare themselves no better than they would
for a game of cards. One must first learn how these markets work,
then learn about the many different kinds of analysis that are avail-
able, such as, fundamental and technical analysis. On a smaller scale,
the field of technical analysis offers a host of varying techniques:
Japanese candlestick analysis is one of these.
This book emphasizes that candlestick analysis should be used
with other analysis methods. At the risk of sounding contradictory, I
would like to warn that too many methods can only confuse and hin-
der. It reminds me of the saying that the person with a watch always
knows what time it is, but the person with two watches is never sure.
Let me say it succinctly and clearly! Candle pattern analysis should
always be used with other confirming techniques, such as the filter-
ing technique described in Chapter 9 and/or the techniques outlined
by Ryan Litchfield in Chapter 10 involving support and resistance
areas on charts.
It has been shown that candle pattern analysis can enhance the use
and timing of popular technical indicators. Filtered candlesticks con-

sistently outperform a host of technical indicators and usually candle
patterns by themselves. The combination of technical indicators and
techniques is not new; in fact, it is the method of analysis most suc-
cessful traders use. Adding candle patterns to the arsenal will surely
further improve trading results.
Over 7 million days of data is strong evidence to support the sta-
tistics in the Pattern Detail Information Boxes. The average % Wins
ranged from 64% to 41%, with only 5 patterns above 59%. Is a
%Win of 58% good enough to not require confirmation? I don’t
think so; that is why I state time and time again that candle patterns
need to be used with other technical techniques. The Japanese litera-
ture was void of specifics and kept candle patterns out of the specific
definition arena—a little light on details and lots of generalizations.
Don’t get caught up in the hype and cheerleading about Japanese
candlesticks; use them to enhance other technical methods. Their
short-term nature will almost always improve the other techniques.
The use of candlestick charting is clearly a more visibly enhanced
method of viewing price data. Anyone who would prefer bar charts
is just afraid of change and cannot justify it other than stubbornness.
I’m sure that with the passing of time, new and different analysis
techniques will surface. Some will gain in popularity; some will go by
the wayside. Any analysis technique that has a substantial basis for
its method will usually survive. I am convinced that candlestick
charting and candle pattern analysis will be a survivor.

Appendix A: Interview
with Japanese Trader
Mr. Takehiro Hikita
Mr. Takehiro Hikita has graciously provided me with a large amount of
insight into the candle pattern philosophy. I have never met anyone so
devoted to the detailed study of a concept as he. He started using can-
dlestick analysis many years ago. In fact, all of his charting was done by
hand until personal computers became available.
During a trip to Japan in January, 1992, I studied the candle phi-
losophy and interpretation with Mr. Hikita. I also maintained a log
of our conversations, from which I have selected appropriate ques-
tions for this interview.
Occasional editing was done to assist in clarifying his answers,
definitely not to change the meaning. It became quite obvious to me
that using English as a second language resulted in a completely hon-
est and direct response; with no effort to be clever or entertaining. I
found this to be quite refreshing and decided that you might also.
1. How and when did you first become interested in investing and
trading?
I believe it was when I was around 31 years of age, that is over 25
years ago. It was, however, once terminated and I stayed out of the
market for about 2 years losing money, more than enough at that time.

2. When did you realize that a form of technical analysis was better
that fundamental analysis?
It was when I started trading again and I was around 41 years of age,
after leaving the company for some reason. Beginning with candle-
stick pattern analysis, I studied and researched all different kinds of
Japanese analysis techniques with real trading, and was extended
later on the method available in the States. My starting to trade again
was with the policy to do so based on the technical analysis and no
more guesses and fundamental analysis to make a living. I am fortu-
nately still in the business of trading.
Speaking of this story a little further I started subscribing to Com-
modities(now called Futures) and purchased many publications such
as Commodity Trading Systems and Methods written by Kaufman
and Wilder’s publications. My first use of a calculator was the pro-
grammable Texas Instruments product on Wilder’s method. Then the
Casio’s programmable calculator for me to build in my own method,
as I became serious. Then to make the daily analysis much easier, I
purchased the IBM-5100 with 32K memory; it was 1977.
In 1979, I learned the Apple II came out on the market which has a
graphic capability. I then immediately purchased it by importing
directly from the States. In 1980, I joined CompuTrac and attended
their first TAG Conference in New Orleans. My Stock & Commodi-
ties magazine subscription started then.
3. Did you always use candle charting for your analysis? If not,
when did you start suing candle charts?
It was from the very beginning, as far as taking a look at the market
in general, to know how the market is acting. The candlestick chart-
ing method is the only one available in Japan to record the history of
the price activity in graphic form. It is just like the bar chart in the

States. Regardless of whether I liked it or not, it was what was used
then.
But, the candlestick pattern analysis is another subject, rather than
the charting itself. My interest on how to read the pattern better was
probably few years later. I first started trading after reading the first
issue of Shimuzu’s book in 1965, the original of The Japanese Chart
of Charts translated by Nicholson.
4. Are candles used in Japan today as widely as bar charts are used
in the United States?
As already mentioned, there is no other method than candlestick
charting to show a market record and activity in Japan. Yes, it is
being used just like the bar chart in the States. The pattern recogni-
tion is another subject within the chart analysis.
5. Is the word candlestick a Western term? If so, what is candle
charting and analysis called in Japan?
There is generally nothing but the candlestick charting to show the
trend and market activity, and any other are classified as the analysis
since they are rather clear to know the pinpoint to take an action, like
the Point and Figure chart. Speaking of the chart, we generally call
it Hi Ashi/Daily Charts, Shu Ashi/Weekly Chart, and Tsuki Ashi/
Monthly Chart. The Japanese word for candle is roshoku.
For your information, Ashi means Leg or better say Foot, and the
foot has an inside meaning of the past record, that is probably from
the foot stamp that shows the past movement and activities, not only
as a market term but in general. I then feel the Candlefoots is better
to be called in English. It is, however, alright as lone as understand-
able and sounds smooth to people’s ears.

6. Do you trade stocks, futures, or both?
Yes, I trade both, I trade actively the futures but not the stocks. My
trading stock is a long-term basis, never sell. This is in order to hedge
from inflation, while trading the futures is to make money in the
short term.
There are other reasons. It is easier to find a pivot in the futures,
especially to find a pinpoint to short and I like to sell, rather than go
long, which has a false start often, compared to going short. Not only
that, but it will be only one-third of the time needed for movement to
gain the same price difference in the case of short, compared to long.
7. Have you found that candles work better with stocks, futures, or
does it matter?
Again, the candle charts and candle pattern analysis should be sepa-
rated. The candlestick is only the chart itself, but the candlestick pat-
terns are the analysis based generally on the Sakata’s Five Law, or
somehow originating from it. There are two applications in the law,
one for daily and the other for a weekly chart, which has a different
definition. The daily candlesticks pattern work better on the futures.
It is again because of speed. The futures has a short trend cycle white
the stocks is longer.
8. Which candle patterns seem to work best for you? Can you list
your 10 favorite patterns?
Your question is too straightforward, even though it might be scien-
tific approach to research, so it is awfully difficult to answer it. You
have to understand that the candle pattern analysis is originating
from man’s experience in trading, and that is a mix of market ten-
dency with the human psychology expressed in the pattern. There is
no scientific logic at all.

Approaching from a statistic viewpoint and supposing there were
100% perfect patterns, if it comes once a year, or about one every
three years, nobody can keep watching to see it and catch it. It must
be based on such a daily analysis, repeating tedious business. There
is, also, no guarantee that a pattern that showed 100% success in the
past will work well repeatedly in future. In statistical speaking, the
number of the sample is the important factor, and so it cannot be
compared with others in a different number of sampling.
I would like to see a research report that will be able to do by your
software, or will be done by somebody else. Again, there will be all
different results from each software, even using exactly the same
data, because of the definition used by every software program. They
will each be a little bit different in defining the patterns, along with
the definition of filtering to define it. So any such research report
should be with a note within this program and within that program,
not as a candle pattern itself. If is a matter of the pattern quality
inside the software rather than the system quality.
In conclusion, I should say it always depends on how it is used, in
conjunction with others, and market conditions such as how many
new highs or new lows are included, but not by the candlestick pat-
tern itself. Again, the candle pattern is one of the analysis tools.
9. Which candle patterns do you think are not very good? How
about a list?
Again, my answer will be the same as the above explained. It depends
upon the market condition and the price level and so on.
10. Do you trade or make timing decisions based solely on candle
patterns or do you use them in conjunction with other technical
indicators?



==================================================

Of course I use the candles pattern in conjunction with other techni-
cal indicators. As you know there is no perfect technical analysis
method by itself, and again the candlestick pattern is also one of
them covering some part of the 360 degrees that must be defended.
The daily candlestick pattern analysis is, however, good with futures
as one of the timing tools. Again, there is nothing that covers all the
degrees needed for technical analysis.
It is my intention to make a mark in trading by the number of con-
tracts in opening positions. Depending upon the market condition,
that requires the guts, too, which is another of the factors required.
One contract each time without the accent will never let you make
money. This is one reason why I am not interested in any of the valu-
able factors of optimizing automated trading systems. They seem to
be only playing the game for fun, so I don’t like it. Everybody who
wants to make money should be aware of no easy money anywhere
in the world, unless you are lucky or originated from a son of a king.
Author’s Note: Mr. Hikita is referring to trading multiple contracts
when the candle signals are supported. Also, he stressed the impor-
tance of using the candle pattern signal to assist in opening and clos-
ing of position, not necessarily for reversing positions only.
11. Which indicators have you found that work well with candle
patterns?
I have to emphasize, this time, that it depends upon the market con-
dition and the price level which indicator is good to use with the can-
dle patterns. I feel, however, that stochastic %D works fairly well in
general, if you can correctly count the cycles and confluence/conver-
gence on different cycles generated by %D. And, pinpointing tops
and bottoms using a combination of the stochastic oscillator seems
good.

12. Candlestick analysis is growing rapidly in the United States. Do
you think that it is just a fad or do you think candle analysis is
here to stay?
I suppose it is not a fad and will stay long in the States. Because this
way of expression of the market has much advantage in comparing
it to the bar charts, so that it is easier to understand the daily price
change. There is also another good point. For instance it has a open
price mark, which we understand is an important factor to read the
market. Also, it is easy to know by one quick look at the candle
which way the market moved during the day. Since each pattern
has a deep meaning similar to Gann analysis, it will last a long
time within traders who are interested in the philosophy behind the
patterns.
13. What advice would you offer to Western traders abut candle-
stick analysis?
To understand the candle patterns you should understand the philos-
ophy inside and behind each pattern. Since it is not a perfect tech-
nique, as is the same case with others, it is also important not to
depend solely on the pattern itself, but use it in conjunction with the
others based on a logically established method. The candle pattern
analysis is one of the analysis methods that was built up by human
impressions and expressed by image form the combination of the
pattern based on history. Beyond a maximum possible technical
analysis, there is another world of discipline of mental power, that is
to establish your philosophy.
The candle patterns must be believed in. If you get signal, you must
execute or follow the market very closely. Stay in touch with each
candle signal. If you become disconnected, the psychology behind
candle pattern will not work well.

Once you establish your trading policy, whatever you can believe
based on the above explanations, you will not make a big mistake.
You will be aware of mistakes in advance within an acceptable level
of damage, as long as you are employing a proper trend analysis. If
you have this policy, you will then not be disappointed by any acci-
dent and will be able to understand the way the market is wrong,
instead of you and your policy, in the case of the market being
against you.
FINAL NOTE
As you can see from this interview, Mr. Hikita thinks that the sepa-
ration of candlestick charting and candle pattern analysis is impor-
tant. Also, one cannot forget the underlying psychology behind each
candle pattern. These are insights into the minds of the traders and
speculators that move the market every day.
Mr. Hikita always referred to his trading analysis as dancing with
the trend. This concept is not new to technical analysis. However,
many traders must graduate from the school of bitter experience
before they realize its importance.

Appendix B: Derivative
Charting Methods
Candlestick charting has produced a number of derivative charting
and analysis methods. The appeal of candlestick charts, as a method
of plotting market data, is that they visually help to interpret the
market. Your brain can quickly assimilate the information because it
is displayed so consistently well. A new charting method, called Can-
dlePower charting, adds a new dimension to candlestick charts: vol-
ume. CandlePower is a trademark of N-Squared Computing, now
North Systems, Inc., the originator of the concept.
CANDLEPOWER CHARTING
CandlePower Charting is another visually appealing charting tech-
nique that combines the power of Japanese candlesticks and volume.
Most charting software packages have chosen to use the term Can-
dleVolume instead of CandlePower for this charting method.
Typical charting (whether bar or candlesticks) shows the price

action on the vertical scale and time on the horizontal scale (see Chap-
ter 1). Volume is usually depicted as a histogram plot under the prices.
Two significant pieces of information are generated each time a trans-
action occurs between a buyer and a seller. One of these, price change,
we tend to react to emotionally, and the other, volume, we largely
ignore. Volume is certainly a more valuable tool to market analysis
than is usually acknowledged. Richard Arms claims that price tells us
what is happening and volume tells us how it is happening. Joseph
Granville built an entire career analyzing and writing about volume.
Volume, during most phases of the market, will precede prices.
This is a hotly contested remark, but watching both price and volume
can only enhance your timing and decision making. Simply said,
when price and volume are increasing, it is considered bullish. Like-
wise, when prices and volume are decreasing, it is considered bearish.

As shown in Figure B-1, the body of a CandlePower day, just like
a candlestick, is made up of the difference between the open and
close. The color of the body and the shadows also follow the same
convention used in Japanese candlestick charting. The difference is

Appendix B
that the width of the body is a reflection of the volume for that day.
A day with large volume will be a wider candlestick body than a day
with less volume. On a chart, it is easy to pick the largest volume
day by finding the widest body. Likewise, the day with the smallest
volume will be the thinnest body.
Many candle patterns can have added importance when volume is
introduced. For instance, a bullish Engulfing Day will be even more
bullish if the second day also is accomplished by larger volume. A
Morning Star pattern can be judged more successful if there is exces-
sive volume on the last day.

Appendix B
In Figure B-2, the CandlePower chart on Avon products (AVP), no-
tice how the upmove contains large white candle lines. These wide
lines show that the upmove is fully supported by volume. Once the
large white days dry up, the move has probably run its course.
The large black day in the chart of Bell South (BEL) shows a clas-
sic volume blow-off day (Figure B-3). After a good upmove, the vol-
ume starts to dry up. Then, in one day, prices explode to the upside,
but close near their lows on very large volume. A few days into the
decline, a three-day rally is terminated with a gap down. Then the
decline continues.

Appendix B
In Figure B-4, the chart of Citicorp (CCI), notice how each turning
point in the market is accomplished by large volume. The market
bottomed with a large black day, then rallied. The rally stopped with
a large white day, then went sideways until the next large white day.
From there it gapped up twice, followed by two days of indecision
(Spinning Tops), each with large volume. Here again, Spinning Tops
with large volume support the indecision on the marketplace. Large
amounts of stock changed hands, but no side took the leadership.
The bottom reversal toward the end of December on the chart on
Litton (LIT) shows continually large-volume days (Figure B-5). In

fact, if it were not for the small white Spinning Top day, a Morning
Star bullish reversal pattern would have represented the bottom.
Here is another example where volume increasing throughout a pat-
tern will add to its significance.
Figure B-6, the last example of CandlePower charting, shows more
data (volume maximum has been reduced), so the richness of the
charting method can be fully appreciated.

CONDENSED CANDLEPOWER CHARTING
Another twist is added to CandlePower charting with Condensed
CandlePower charting. In this approach, the time element is returned
to the horizontal axis. The variable-width candlestick bodies are still
displayed accurately, but they overlap. Each new day starts at a uni-
form distance (time) interval. This method of charting displays more
data at once, while still giving the large-volume days visibility. Indi-
vidual candle patterns are more difficult to see, though.

Appendix B
Figure B-7
Areas of volume congestion can be easily spotted using condensed
CandlePower Charting. Trendlines used on this type of chart would
also reflect the volume component.
The data used for the Condensed CandlePower chart in Figure
B-7 is the same as in the last example of CandlePower Charting. This
was done intentionally, so you could easily see the difference in chart-
ing methods.
