TO SUSAN,
'
without whom this book would have been ready much sooner
A number of people have read all or part of the manuscript at vari-
ous stages of its development. They are too numerous to be listed,
but I want to thank them all for their help and criticism. Byron
Wien, in particular, has gone beyond the call of duty in reading and
commenting on, the manuscript at three different stages of develop-
ment. Special thanks are due to Antonio Foglia, who generated the
graphics that illustrate the real-time experiment. Larry Chiarello
supplied the figures.
I also want to thank the team that contributed to the perform-
ance of Quantum Fund during the experiment: Bill Ehrman, Gary
Gladstein, Tom Larkin, Robert Miller, Steven Okin, Joe Orofino,
Stephen Plant, Allan Raphael, and Anne Stires.

Four hundred seventy-three million to one. Those are the odds
against George Soros compiling the investment record he did as the
mabger of the ~uantumFu nd from 1968 through 1993. His invest-
ing record is the most unimpeachable refutation of the random
walk hypothesis ever!
As a trader coming of age in the latter half of the frenetic 1970s
and the 1980s, The Alchemy of Finance was somewhat of a revolution-
ary book. Remember, this was the period when trend following
and indexation were the vogue in investing. It was a time when
technical analysis (the study of price movemen? as a forecasting
tool) reached its zenith. Traders of my generation armed them-
selves with charts and computer-generated graphics that predicted
future price direction. We sat day after day in front of screens, mes-
merized by blinking lights and everchangir~gn umbers in a deafen-
ing cacophony of information overload. With the possible exception
of Elliott Wave Theory, an intellectual framework for understand-
ing the course of social, political, and economic events was notice-
ably forgotten in favor of just making sure that one was part of the
ever-quickening process.
The Alchemy of Finance was a shot out of the dark for me. It let
me take a giant step forward by first taking a step backwards,
clarifying events that appeared so complex and so overwhelming.
During an era when so much money was made in larger than life
events, from the Hunt brothers' squeeze of the silver market in
1979 to KKR1s takeover of RJR Nabisco in 1989, Mr. Sorosls theory
of reflexivity is the first modern, nontechnical effort to describe

2 Foreword
and forecast the dynamic interplay between the participants in
I
the process. That is the brilliance of this book. It describes the dy-
namics of the path between points of extreme valuation and equi-
librium in the marketplace. This is particularly important for the
average investor. How many times have we been correctly long
near the bottom or short near the top of a major market move? But
our staying power with these positions has been weak (as well as
our returns) because of a lack of understanding of the path of big
price moves. Soros gives us critical insight into that path and thus
more confidence in our investments. This constitutes 70% of any
successful investing campaign.
When I enter the inevitable losing streak that befalls every ill-
vestor, I pick up The Alchemy and revisit Mr. Soros's campaigns.
+ Studying how he coped with adversity provides an excellent tu-
torial for breaking the string of negative behaviors that occasion-
ally besets any investor. Winning is infectious. And this book in
replete with examples of trading behaviors all would want to emu-
late. Importantly, Mr. Soros's intellect gives him the confidence and
strength of his own convictions to stay with his positions even dur-
ing trying periods. In that sense, The Alchemy joins Edwin LefGvre's
Reminiscences of a Stock Operator as a timeless instructional guide of
the marketplace. And as such, Soros should beware! In the World
War I1 movie Patton, my favorite scene is when U.S. General George
S. Patton has just spent weeks studying the writing of his Germany
adversary Field Marshall Erwin Rommel and is crushing him in an
epic tank battle in Tunisia. Patton, sensing victory as he peers onto
the battle field from his command post, growls, "Rommel, you mag-
nificent bastard. I read your book! " Enough said.
The Alchemy is also an excellent economic and political hijiory oi
recent times. From unknowingly providing a blueprint as to how
the savings and loan fiasco in the United States would be resolved
six years in advance (page 124) to predicting the stock market crash
of 1987 two years in advance (page 181), Soros reveals himself as the
great market visionary of our time.
History will probably remember Mr. Soros as the speculator who
tilted against the Bank of England in 1992 (and freed the English
people from recession). His billion dollar score is simply too com-
pelling a story for scribes to overlook. Mr. Soros himself would
probably like to be remembered as a great economist or even scien-
tist. But I am going to remember him for something even more im-
portant, for which he does not receive the credit he deserves. He is

someone who genuinely cares about the state of the human condi-
tion and tries to better it. His myriad and monumental philan-
thropical efforts will qualify him as one of history's great
benefactors. Even today at age 62, he pursues the activities of his
six foundations with the vigor and work ethic of a young turk on
the way up the financial ladder, working 18-hour days around the
globe on behalf of fjis causes. He does not just write checks, which
any wealthy person can do. He is a hands-on workaholic who mate-
rially impacts the quality of the lives of people less fortunate than
he. Now this, this is a sign of greatness.

PREFACE
Seven eventful years have passed since The Alchemy of Finance was
first published. My investment fund, the Quantum Fund, has con-
tinued to flourish: Shareholders have enjoyed average annual gains
of 35. .8% in the last seven years in spite of a setback in the crash of
1987. Quantum Fund has also spawned a number of offspring,
some of which are doing even better than the goose that is laying
the golden eggs. Starting in 1989, we decided to distribute a por-
tion of our earnings to shareholders, either in cash or in shares of
the newly created funds. As a result, we now manage seven funds
with combined equity of over $10 billion.
I have become progressively less active in the management of the
funds. I was fortunate in meeting Stanley Druckenmiller through
The Alchemy of Finance. He was managing another fund at the time,
and he sought me out because he was intrigued by my book. We
started talking and, eventually, he joined my firm. At the begin-
ning, he found it difficult to work with me. Although I gave him a
great deal of authority, he was inhibited by my presence and felt
that he was not doing as well as he had before joining my firm. For-
tunately, I was becoming increasingly involved in the revolutionary
process that led to the collapse of communism. I was establishing a
network of foundations throughout the communist world and it in-
volved travelling in places where communications were rather poor.
In the summer of 1989, I told Stan that he must take full charge of
running the Fund. Since then we have had no difficulties.
I became the coach, and he became the competitor. Our perfor-
mance improved and we embarked on a period of sustained growth.
In each of the last three years, we chalked up gains in excess of

50%. Although we hpve had two similar periods of prosperity pre-
viously, this qualifies as an exceptional performance in view of our
outlandish size. Druckenmiller is not only a good fund manager, he
is also a good partner. Under his leadership, we have been able to
enlarge and improve our management team so that it now has a
depth which it never had before. So it happened that I found the
reward for my philaqthropic activities in the prosperity of my busi-
ness. That prosperity enabled me to expand the foundation net-
work at a breakneck speed.
My participation in the collapse of communism is a different
story which has to be told in a different place. In fact, I have already
written two books on the subject, Gyersing ihtl Soviei Syslsiem in 1930,
and Underwriting Democracy in 1991. The point that needs to be
made here is that I was guided by exactly the same philosophy in
my philanthropic activities in Eastern Europe as in the financial
markets. As the reader will learn, I treat developments in financial
markets as a historical process. That makes my theory eminently
applicable to a histyical process such as the collapse of commu-
nism. I did apply my theory and on the whole it enabled me to an-
ticipate events better than most people. As I discovered, there is a
great deal of similarity between a boom-bust process in the finan-
cial ma&kets and the rise and fall of the Soviet system.
It is ironic that I b'ecame famous, not because of my activities in
Eastern Europe, but because of the profit we made on sterling when
Britain left the Exchange Rate Mechanism on Seember 16,1992. I
became an instant celebrity, first in Britain, then in the rest of the
world. When it became known that the Quantum group of funds
had bought a large block of Newmont Mines, the price of gold
soared. Although I expressed no opinion or. gold, ail itil3ds ur' opin-
ions were attributed to me. I made some attempts to rebut them,
but to no avail. Although I had not sought guru status, I could not
ignore it when it was thrust upon me. In fact, I welcomed it because
I thought that it would be useful in having my voice heard on polit-
ical issues. But that was not as simple as it seemed. When I said that
the Bundesbank's high interest rate policy was becoming counter-
productive, the markets responded by pushing down the German
Mark. But when I inveighed against European policy on Bosnia, I
was either ignored or told to stick to the field of my expertise. I
fared particularly poorly in France, where I refrained from specu-
lating against the franc because I did not want to be responsible for
the collapse of what remained of the European Exchange Rate

Mechanism, but I was blamed for it anyhow. The French govern-
I
ment resented my advice even more than it would have resented
my speculative activities. It goes to show that speculators ought to
speculate and keep their mouths shut.
My notoriety as a financial guru has created a tremendous de-
mand for The Alchemy of Finance, hence this new edition. I must con-
fess that my thinking has evolved a great deal since I wrote this
book, but I have been concerned mainly with historical processes,
not with financial ones. I cannot summarize my ideas in this pref-
ace-I need to write another book. I intend to do so as soon as time
permits, but there is one important theoretical point I need to make
in urcler iu Llir~gi iti~bo ok in line with my curr6nt thirtkmng.
In The Alchemy of Finance, I put forward the theory of reflexivity
I as if it were relevant at all times. That is true in the sense that the
two-way feedback mechanism that is the hallmark of reflexivity
can come into play at any time, but it is not true in the sense that
it is at play at all times. In fact, in most situations it is so feeble
that it can be safely ignored. We may distinguish between near-
equilibrium conditions where certain corrective mechanisms pre-
vent perceptions and reality from drifting too far apart, and
far-from-equilibrium conditions where a reflexive double-feedback
mechanism is at work and there is no tendency for perceptions and
reality to come close together without a significant change in the
prevailing conditions, a change of regime. In the first case, classical
economic theory applies and the divergence between perceptions
and reality can be ignored as mere noise. In the second case, the
theory. of equilibrium becomes irrelevant and we are confronted
with a one-directional historical process where changes in both
yerceptims and reslity a x irreversible. It is important to distin- , ,
guish between these two different states of affairs because what is
normal in one is abnormal in the other
The idea of a distinction between nea rium and far-from-
equilibrium conditions is present in The Alchemy of Finance. At the
end of Chapter 1, I distinguish between humdrum and historical
change but I understate the importance of the distinction. I call it
"tautological." I now consider this a mistake. The tautology arises
only because I do not probe deeply enough and cover up with a tau-
tology what is a fundamental difference in the structure of events.
In most phenomena investigated by scientific method, one set
of conditions follows another irrespective of what anybody thinks
about them. The phenomena studied by social sciences, which

==================================================

Preface 7
include the finan~ial~markethsa, ve thinking participants and this
complicates matters. As I have tried to show, the participants' views
are inherently biased. Instead of a direct line leading from one set of
conditions to the ne~otn e, there is a constant criss-crossing be-
tween the objective, abservable conditions and the participant's ob-
servations and vice &sa: participants base their decisions not on
objective conditions but on their interpretation of those conditions.
This is an important point and it has far-reaching consequences. It
introduces an element of indeterminacy which renders the subject
matter less amenable to the kind of generalizations, predictions,
and explanations that have given natural science its reputation. Ex-
actly because it is so disruptive; the social sciztnces in general and
economic theory in particular have done their best to eliminate or
to ignore the element of indeterminacy. I have taken issue with that
endeavor and tried to develop an alternative approach which takes
the participants' bias:as its starting point.
In retrospect, I may have overstated my case. There are many sit-
uations that can be fruitfully studied by taking the participants'
bias as given and ignoring the element of indeterminacy which it
may generate. It is only in certain respects and in certain special
circumstances that the indeterminacy becomes significant. It comes
into play when expectations about the future have a bearing on
present behavior-which is the case in financial markets. But even
there, some mechanism must be triggered for the participants' bias
to affect not only market prices but the so-called fundamentals
which are supposed to determine market prices. Apparently 1 have
failed tokake this sufficiently clear. The message of my boo
is usually summed up by saying that the participants' value judg-
ments are always biased and the prevailing bias aifects narket
prices. If that is all I had to say it would be hardly worth writing a
book about it. My point is that there are occasions when the bias
affects not only market prices but also the so-called fundamentals.
This is when reflexivity becomes important. It does not happen all
the time but when it does, market prices follow a different pattern.
They also play a different role: they do not merely reflect the
so-called fundamentals; they themselves become one of the funda-
mentals which shape the evolution of prices. This recursive rela-
tionship renders the evolution of prices indeterminate and the
so-called equilibrium price irrelevant.
Nobody would deny that individual participants operate with bi-
ased views; but the prevailing wisdom holds that the participants'

==================================================

8 Preface
bias can be dismissed as temporary aberrations, so-called random
-w-
walks. That is the point on which I disagree. I now believe this
point can be more effectively made by drawing a distinction be-
tween near-equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium conditions than
by proposing a general theory of history based on the constant
cross-crossing between perceptions and reality as I have done in
The Alchemy of Finance. That does not mean that there is anything
wrong with the general theory; it means only that the concept of
reflexivity becomes more significant if it is reserved for those cases
where the double feedback mechanism is actually at work.
The Alchemy of Finance is devoted to the study of such cases. The
asst c??vious exam.ple is equity lewragirtg where a temporary
overvaluation of shares is converted into per-share earnings
through the issue of shares at inflated prices. In most of the cases
4
discussed, the participants' bias involves an actual error in their
thinking. For instance, in the late 1970s international bankers lent
too much money to developing countries because they failed to
recognize that the so-called debt ratios they used to measure the
creditworthiness of the borrowing countries were reflexive in the
sense that they were affected by their own lending activity. But
it is not necessary for the bias to involve an actual error. As I show
in Chapter 3, a freely fluctuating exchange rate system is inher-
ently unstable because of the influence of trend-following specu-
lation, yet speculators follow the correct strategy by following the
trend.
Judging by the public reaction-which consists mainly of com-
ments by journalists who read the book superficially or not at all-
I have not been successful in demonstrating the significance of
reflexivity. Only the iirst part of my argument-that the prevailing
bias affects market prices-seems to have registered. The second
part-that the prevailing bias can in certain circumstances also af-
fect the so-called fundamentals and changes in market prices cause
changes in market prices-seems to have gone unnoticed.
The fault is at least partially mine. Since reflexivity changes the
structure of events, I have tried to put forward a reflexive structure
as the universally valid way of looking at the evolution of market
prices-a kind of general theory h la Keynes in which the absence
of reflexivity constitutes a special case. It would have been better
to present reflexivity as the special case because what endows re-
flexivity with significance is the fact that it operates intermittently.

==================================================

Preface 9
Once the significance of reflexivity has sunk in and the inadequacy
of the prevailing wisdom has been recognized, the time would have
been ripe for proposing a general theory of reflexivity.
I have my excuses. I did not observe reflexivity in financial mar-
kets but developed reflexivity as an abstract philosophical concept
before I entered the financial markets. In other words, I failed as a
philosophical speculptor before I succeeded as a financial one. Ap-
parently, my failure as a philosopher carried over into my book be-
cause I did not make the concept of reflexivity-which can be
observed and converted into profit-as clear as it could be. When
one discovers something new, one has an understandable inclina-
aon to exaggerate it$ importance. This is what I did with reiiexiv-
ity. By proposing a general theory of reflexivity, I may have gone
too far too soon. I claimed that economic theory is false and social
science is a false metaphor. These are exaggerated claims. Since far-
from-equilibrium conditions arise only intermittently, economic
theory is only intermittently false. And the dividing line between
natural and social sqience is not quite as hard and fast as I made it
appear when I wrote the book. These qualifications render reflexiv-
ity more rather than less significant.
Once the concept of reflexivity is established, the range of its ap-
plicability seems to widen. It is possible to treat the evolution of
prices in all financial markets taken together as a reflexive, histori-
cal process. I have done so in The Alchemy of Finance when I ana-
lyzed Reagan's "Imperial Circle," and I have found other examples
since the book was published, such as the German Imperial Circle
after the fall of the Berlin Wall. (See appendix: "The Prospect of Eu-
ropean Disintegration.") But there is a danger in pushing the con-
cept oi reflexivity too far, as I nave learned at my owri expefiac.
There are lohg fallow periods when the movements in financial
markets do not seem to follow a reflexive tune but rather resemble
the random walks mandated by the efficient market theory. In
these circumstances, it is better to do nothing than to pursue a re-
f lexive hypothesis.
Treating reflexivity as an intermittent phenomenon rather than
as a universally valid condition opens up fertile fields for investiga-
tion. For instance, the question poses itself: How can near- and far-
from-equilibrium conditions be distinguished from each other?
What is the criterion of demarcation? I have done a lot of thinking
on that question and I have the beginnings of an answer. Whether

I can formulate it properly remains to be seen in my next book. It
4
revolves around a question of values and it is relevant for society in
general, not only for financial markets. My next book, if it is ever
written, will be a theory of history, not a theory of finance. I am
providing an example of how the boom-bust pattern of financial
markets can be applied to larger historical processes in the ap-
pendix where I reproduce a lecture I delivered on September 29,
1993, entitled "Prospect for European Disintegration."

INTRODUCTION
In a very real sense, this book is my life's work. It touches on
many of my most abiding interests and it brings together the two
main strands in my 'intellectual development: one abstract and
one practical.
The abstract came' first. Ever since I became conscious of my
existence I have had a passionate interest in understanding it, and
1 regarded my own 'understanding as the central problem that
needed to be understood. To understand oneself-gnote aucton;
nosce te ipsum-is an impossible task. TO achiwe-anythingsL_
sembling knowledge we must be abJ~I~-drawa d@in-cti-onebe-
tweven -su - b j-- e c- t- - a - n- d o- b-- ject; yet in this case the two are the same.
~hd-oniehi nks is part3 what one thinks about; therefore, one's
thinking lacks an independent pint of referexce by -,=.hichi t can
be judged-it lacks objectivity.
As an undergraduate I studied economics, but I found eco-
nomic theory highly unsatisfactory because it failed to come to
grips with th$problem; indeed, it went through great contortions
to avoid it. Economics seeks to be a science. Science is supposed
to be objective and it is difficult to be scientific when the subject
matter, the participant in the economic process, lacks objectivity.
I was greatly influenced at the time by Karl Popper's ideas on
scientific method. I accepted most of his views, with one major
exception. He argued in favor of what he called "unity of
methodH1-that is, the methods and criteria that apply to the
study of natural phenomena also apply to the study of social
events. I felt that there was a fundamental difference between the

==================================================

12 Introduction
two: the events studied by the social sciences have thinking par-
t ticipants; natural phenomena do not. The participants' thinking
creates problems that have no counterpart in natural science. The
closest analogy is in quantum physics, where scientific observa-
tion gives rise to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle; but in social
events it is the participants' thinking that is responsible for the
element of uncertainty, not the outside observer.
Natural science studies events that consist of a sequence of
facts. When events have thinking participants, the subject matter
is no longer confined to facts but also includes the participants'
perceptions. The chain of causation does not lead directly from
fact to fact but from fact to perception and from perception to fact.
This would not create any insuperable difficulties if there were
some kind of correspondence or equivalence between facts and
I
perceptions. Unfortunately, that is impossible because the partic-
ipants' perceptions do not relate to facts, but to a situation that is
contingent on their own perceptions and therefore cannot be
treated as a fact.
Economic theory tries to sidestep the issue by introducing the
assumption of rational behavior. People are assumed to act by
choosing the best of the available alternatives, but somehow the
distinction between perceived alternatives and facts is assumed
away. The result is a theoretical construction of great elegance
that resembles natural science but does not resemble reality. It
relates to an ideal world in which participants act on the basis of
perfect knowledge and it produces a theoretical equilibrium in
which the allocation of resources is at an optimum. It has little
relevance to the real world in which people act on the basis of
imperfect understanding and equilibrium is beyond rea~h.
The relationship between the participants' understanding and
the situation in which they participate continued to preoccupy
me long after I left college. My first priority was to try and make a
living but in my spare time I wrote a philosophical treatise on the
subject with the catchy title "The Burden of Consciousness." Un-
fortunately, the title was the best part of it. By the time I finished,
I disagreed with my own presentation. I spent three years revising
it. One day I reread what I had written the day before and I could
not make head or tail of it. It made me realize that I had reached
a dead end, and I decided to give it up. That was when the prac-
tical streak in me began to dominate my intellectual development.
If I had to sum up my practical skills, I would use one word:
survival. When I was an adolescent, the Second World War gave

Introduction 13
me a lesson that I have never forgotten. I was fortunate enough to
have a father who was highly skilled in the art of survival, having
lived through the Russian revolution as an escaped prisoner of
war. Under his tutelgge the Second World War served as an ad-
vanced course at a tender age. As the reader shall see, the invest-
ment vehicle I created a quarter of a century later drew heavily on
skills I learned as an ;adolescent.
After leaving college I had a number of false starts and finally
became an international arbitrage trader in stocks, first in London
and then in New York. When the European Common Market was
formed in 1957, American investors became interested in Euro-
pean shares, 1 became a security analyst r;bsiaisg Aiiuc~icrnni irsti-
tutions on their European investments and for a brief period I
ruled as a one-eyed king among the blind. My glory came to an
abrupt end when President Kennedy introduced a so-called inter-
est equalization tax which effectively stopped purchases of for-
eign securities. I decided to put my money-making activities on
the back burner and spent three years, from 1963 to 1966, revising
"The Burden of Consciousness."
When I finally decided to return to the land of the living I
started a model portfolio that became a hedge fund (a mutual fund
that employs leverage and uses various techniques of hedging) in
1969. I have been in charge of that fund ever since, although I
delegated much of the responsibility to others between September
1981 and September 1984. The fund has growhom about $4
million at inception to nearly $2 billion and most of the growth
has been internally generated. Original investors have seen the
value of their shares mulitiply 300-fold. No investment fund has
ever prodsced comparable results,
In the first ten years of my business career I had not much use
for anything I had learned in college and there was an almost total
separation between my practical activities and my theoretical in-
terests. Selling and trading in securities was a game I played with-
out putting my true self on the line.
All this changed when I became a fund manager. I was putting
my money where my mouth was and I could not afford to disso-
ciate myself from my investment decisions. I had to use all my
intellectual rasources and I discovered, to my great surprise and
gratification, that my abstract ideas came in very handy. It would
be an exaggeration to say that they accounted for my success; but
there can be no doubt that they gave me an edge.
I developed my own peculiar approach to investing, which was

' at loggerheads with the prevailing wisdom. The generally ac- .
cepted view is that markets are always right-that is, market
prices tend to discount future developments accurately even
when it is unclear what those developments are. I start with the
opposite point of view. I believe that market prices are always
wrong in the sense that they present a biased view of the future.
But distortion works in both directions: not only do market par-
ticipants operate with a bias, but their bias can also influence the
course of events. This may create the impression that markets
anticipate future developments accurately, but in fact it is not
present expectations that correspond to future events but future
ents that are sha~edby prose~et xpect~?fonsT. he psrticipants'
t
rceptions are inherently flawed, and there is a two-way connec-
tion between flawed perceptions and the actual course of events,
I
which results in a lack of correspondence between the two. I call
this two-way connection "reflexivity."
In the course of my investment activities, I discovered that fi-
nancial markets operate on a principle that is somehow akin to
scientific method. Making an investment decision is like formu-
lating a scientific hypothesis and submitting it to a practical test.
The main difference is that the hypothesis that underlies an in-
vestment decision is intended to make money and not to establish
a universally valid generalization. Both activities involve signifi-
cant risk, and success brings a corresponding reward-monetary
in one case and scientific in the other. Taking this view, it is
possible to see financial markets as a laboratory for testing hy-
potheses, albeit not strictly scientific ones. The truth is, success-
ful investing is a kind of alchemy.
Most market participants do zot view ~ll,arketbii i this ligC:. That
means that they do not know what hypotheses are being tested; it
also means that most of the hypotheses that are submitted to mar-
ket testing are quite banal. Usually they amount to nothing more
than the assertion that a particular stock is going to outperform
the market averages.
I had a certain advantage over other investors because at least I
had an idea about the way financial markets operate. I would be
lying, however, if I claimed that I could always formulate worth-
while hypotheses on the basis of my theoretical framework.
Sometimes there were no reflexive processes to be found; some-
times I failed to find them; and, what was the most painful of all,
sometimes I got them wrong. One way or another, I often invested

without a worthwhile hypothesis and my activities were not very
different from a random walk. But I was attuned to reflexive pro-
cesses in financial markets and my major successes came from
exploiting the opportunities they presented.
My approach to the market was not as abstract as it sounds. It
took an intensely pArsonal, emotional form: testing was closely
associated with pain ;and success with relief. When I asserted that
"markets are always biased" I was giving expression to a deeply
felt attitude: I had a very low regard for the sagacity of profes-
sional investors and the more influential their position the less I
considered them capable of making the right decisions. My part-
ner and 1 taoltl ;m alielous plsasure in makhg rnoriey by selling
short stocks that were institutional favorites. But we differed in
our attitudes to our own activities. He regarded only the other
participants' views as flawed, while I thought that we had as good
a chance of being wrong as anyone else. The assumption of inher-
ently flawed perceptions suited my self-critical attitude.
Operating a hedge ;fund utilized my training in survival to the
fullest. Using leverage can produce superior results when the
going is good, but it can wipe you out when events fail to conform
to your expectations: One of the hardest things to judge is what
level of risk is safe. There are no universally valid yardsticks: each
situation needs to be judged on its own merit. In the final analysis
you must rely on your instincts for survival. Thus my engagement
in running a hedge fund brought together both my abstract inter-
ests and my practical skills.
I did not play the financial markets according to a particular set
of rules; I was always more interested in understanding the
changes that cccur in the rules of the game. I started with hy-
potheses relating to individual companies; with the passage of
time my interests veered increasingly toward macroeconomic
themes. This was due partly to the growth of the fund and partly
to the growing instability of the macroeconomic environment. For
instance, exchange rates were fixed until 1973; subsequently, they
became a fertile field for speculation.
For the past four or five years I have had a growing sense of
impending financial disaster. I felt that a long-lasting expansion-
ary cycle was becoming increasingly unsound and unsustainable
and we were getting ready for a bust. That was one of the reasons
I distanced myself from the active management of the fund in
1981 and reduced its overalflevel of exposure. My interest shifted

from my own survival to the survival of the system. I made a
I study of the international debt problem and published some pa-
pers on the subject. I used the same theoretical framework as in
my investment activities and my analysis was not without merit.
Unfortunately, the more complex the system, the greater the room
for error. I made some mistakes in my analysis that detracted from
the accuracy of my predictions; they also had a detrimental effect
on my investment results until I revised my views in the course
of writing this book.
The more successful I had been in applying my ideas in finan-
cial markets, the keener I became to express them in theoretical
form. I ~u~~tiimt~e~diE eikhth e Iarrtasy that the concept of ref"lr;x-
ivity constitutes a major contribution to our understanding of the
world in which we live. I believed that the participants' bias is
4
the key to an understanding of all historical processes that have
thinking participants, just as genetic mutation is the key to biolog-
ical evolution. But a satisfactory formulation of the theory of re-
flexivity continued to elude me. I always ran into trouble when I
tried to define what I meant by the imperfect understanding of the
participants. To speak accurately of a distortion we must know
what the situation would be if it were not distorted by the partic-
ipants' perceptions. Unfortunately that does not seem possible
because the participants' thinking is an integral part of the situa-
tion they have to think about. It is not surprising that the concept
of reflexivity should present extreme difficulties; if it were an
easier concept to work with, economists and other social scien-
tists would not have gone to such lengths to banish it from their
subject matter.
This book is a finel. attempt to expiore the i~~iplicationofs re-
flexivity. I have tried to circumvent the difficulties I encountered
in the past by approaching the subject from the opposite direc-
tion. Instead of getting bogged down in abstract theory, I am going
to draw on my experimental, practical findings to the greatest
possible extent. I cannot avoid an abstract discussion altogether,
but I have confined it to a single chapter. In exploring the practi-
cal implications, I start with the simplest cases and gradually lead
up to more complex ones. This approach happens to coincide
with the historical order in which 1 encountered reflexive devel-
opments in practice: first the stock market, then the currency mar-
ket, then the international debt problem, and finally what may be
called the credit cycle.

Introduction 17
The stock market provides some pure examples of a boom and
bust pattern; freely floating currency rates allow me to explore
well-formed wave patterns. The boom and bust in international
bank lending is part pf a more complex, historical process of
credit expansion and eventual credit contraction. It has given rise
to the configuration that I have dubbed "Reagan's Imperial Cir-
cle." The configuratioq prevailed from the international debt cri-
sis of 1982 until the first half of 1985 but it was inherently
unstable. How the instability will be resolved is one of the main
questions considered in this book.
The experimental approach has borne unexpected results. I
mads two major discavsries in the courss of writiiig: one is a
I
reflexive connection between credit and collateral; the other is a
reflexive relationship between the regulators and the economy
they regulate.
It has long been asshmed that monetary values are a passive
reflection of the state of affairs in the real world. Classical eco-
nomics focused on the real world and neglected the problems
connected with money and credit; even Keynes couched his gen-
eral theory in real terms. Monetarists sought to stand the relation-
ship on its head: they kgue that it is possible to control inflation
by controlling the growth of the money supply.
In my opinion, all 'these views are based on a fundamental
misconception. Money values do not simply mirror the state of
affairs in the real world; valuation is a positive actqhat makes an
impact on the course of events. Monetary and real phenomena are
connected in a reflexive fashion; that is, they influence each other
mutually. The reflexive relationship manifests itself most clearly
ir, the use ~ n adbu se ol credit.
Loans are based on the lender's estimation of the borrower's
ability to service his debt. The valuation of the collateral is sup-
posed to be independent of the act of lending; but in actual fact
the act of lending can affect the value of the collateral. This is true
of the individual case and of the economy as a whole. Credit
expansion stimulates the economy and enhances collateral val-
ues; the repayment or contraction of credit has a depressing influ-
ence both on the economy and on the valuation of the collateral.
The connection between credit and economic activity is anything
but constant-for instance, credit for building a new factory has
quite a different effect from credit for a leveraged buyout. This
makes it difficult to quantify t& connection between credit and

==================================================

18 Introduction
economic activity. Yet it is a mistake to ignore it. The monetarist
4 school has done so, with disastrous consequences.
The reflexive interaction between the act of lending and collat-
eral values has led me to postulate a pattern in which a period of
gradual, slowly accelerating credit expansion is followed by a
short period of credit contraction-the classic sequence of boom
and bust. The bust is compressed in time because the attempt to
liquidate loans causes a sudden implosion of collateral values.
Economic history has been punctuated by booms and busts.
Nevertheless, the concept of a credit cycle is too simplistic to
explain the course of events. For one thing, the connection be-
!wee~cr edit and sson~mica ctivity is too tenuous and variable to
yield a regular pattern. For another, the sequence of events is
greatly complicated by the influence of economic policy. Periodic
I
busts have been so devastating that strenuous efforts have been
made to prevent them. These efforts have led to the evolution of
central banking and of other mechanisms for controlling credit
and regulating economic activity.
To understand the role of the regulators it must be realized that
they are also participants: their understanding is inherently im-
perfect and their actions have unintended consequences. The re-
lationship between the regulators and the economy is reflexive
and it also exhibits cyclical characteristics in the sense that it
tends to swing from one extreme to another.
What is the connection between the regulatory cycle and the
credit cycle? At this point, my views become very tentative. I
believe that the two cycles broadly overlap in time, that the min-
imum of regulations tends to coincide with the maximum of
credit expansion and vi~eve rsa. But within this chronological
coincidence there is constant interaction between the two cycles
that influences the shape and duration of both. The interaction
between the two cycles yields a unique path that cannot be fitted
into any regular or repetitive pattern.
I have tried to apply this complex and tentative framework to
an interpretation of recent economic and financial history. Need-
less to say, a great many factors come into play; but my focus is
on the twin cycles in credit and regulation. The main topics I deal
with are the transformation of banking from a highly regulated to
a less regulated industry, the boom and bust in international lend-
ing, mergermania, and international capital movements.
Until 1982, the story is a fairly straightforward case of boom

and bust, but after 1982 the situation gets very complicated. If
events had been allo&d to take their course, the uncontrolled
credit expansion of the 1970s would have come to an unhappy
end; but exactly becauae the consequences would have been so
disastrous, the financial authorities came to the rescue and suc-
cessfully avoided a bust. Since then, we have been passing
through uncharted waters. The great boom exhausted itself some
time ago but its life span has been extended by artificial means in
order to avoid a great bust.
I try to trace the unique path that events have taken: the pres-
ervation of the accumulated burden of bad international debt
through the formation cf what I call the "Collective" system of
lending and the emergence of the United States government as
the "borrower of last resort." Both of these are unprecedented
developments. They gave rise to this strange constellation that I
have called the Imperial Circle: a benign circle at the center and a
vicious circle at the periphery of a worldwide system based on a
strong dollar, a strong ;US. economy, a growing budget deficit,
a growing trade deficit, and high real interest rates. The Imperial
Circle held the international economic and financial system to-
gether but it was inherently unstable because the strong dollar
and high real interest rates were bound to outweigh the stimulat-
ing effect of the budget deficit and weaken the U.S. economy. The
Imperial Circle could not last indefinitely. What would happen
next?
X
To answer that question, I conducted an experiment from Au-
gust 1985 onward. In effect, I kept a diary in which I recorded the
thoughts that went into my investment decisions on a real-time
hsis. Since I c~nsideredth e future of the Imperial Circle of park-
mount importance, the experiment served as a test of my ability
to predict the future course of events, using the framework devel-
oped in the book. The experiment was a roaring success in finan-
cial terms-my fund never did better. It also produced a
surprising result: I came out of the experiment with quite differ-
ent expectations about the future.
I started with the presumption that the benign circle was in
danger of reversing itself: a weak dollar and a weak economy
would combine to keep interest rates higher than they ought to
be, and without any scope for further monetary or fiscal stimulus
the decline of both the economy and the dollar would become
irreversible. But the situation was once again saved by the inter-

vention of the monetary authorities. By changing from a system
+
of freely floating exchange rates to a "dirty float," the decline of
the dollar was cushioned, and, with the help of lower interest
rates and booming financial markets, the economy was prevented
from slipping into recession. We entered a new phase which I
describe, with only a modicum of irony, as the "Golden Age of
Capitalism."
It can be seen that this book seeks to accomplish a number of
things at the same time. It propounds not just one general theory
-the theory of reflexivity-but also another specific theory, that
of a credit-cum-regulatory cycle. The latter idea is so tentative
!=
that it hardly qualifies as a theory. Yet I try apijly it zot ~ a ltyo
explain contemporary history but also to predict the outcome,
and in the course of doing so I provide a practical demonstration
t
of the fundamental difference between explaining and predicting
reflexive phenomena. I also try to draw some general conclusions
from the analysis. The most important ones are, first, that it is
credit that matters, not money (in other words, monetarism is a
false ideology), and, second, that the concept of a general equilib-
rium has no relevance to the real world (in other words, classical
economics is an exercise in futility). Financial markets are inher-
ently unstable; that leads to a third conclusion that is better stated
as a question than an assertion: what policy measures are needed
to reestablish the stability of our economic system?
The book would be easier to read if it tried to make just one
point at a time. Unfortunately, that is not possible, because the
various points are interconnected. If the theory of reflexivity were
widely known, I could have taken it for granted and concentrated
on an exploration of +&e credit and regulat~ryc ycles. Si~~iiarlify ,
the fact that financial markets are inherently unstable were gen-
erally recognized, I need not have spent so much time on dem-
onstrating that the concept of equilibrium as used in economic
theory is totally unrealistic. As it is, I had to try to make several
points more or less simultaneously.
To make matters worse, the book does not qualify as a finished
product. When I started writing it, I thought I had a theory of
reflexivity to present and my difficulties related only to its presen-
tation. As I tried to apply the theory to various situations, I dis-
covered that I do not actually have a well-formed theory. The idea
that the participants' biases play an important causal role in his-
torical events is both valid and interesting, but it is too general to

qualify as a theory that can help to explain and predict the course
of events. The boomhust pattern I have established applies to
some developments but not to others. To try to fit every initially
self-reinforcing and eyentually self-defeating development into
its mold can give rise, to serious distortions. I feel like the early
astronomers who tried to describe the elliptical paths of the
planets in terms of circles and semicircles; the only difference is
that the path of reflexibe events is irregular to start with.
My fantasy was to present a general theory of reflexivity that
would explain the great bust of the 1980s in the same way that
Keynes's General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money ex-
plained the Great Depression sf ihz 1330s. As it tr;rns or;:, wa do
not have a great bust and I do not have a general theory. What I
have is an approach that can help to illuminate the present pre-
carious state of our financial system. It cannot explain and predict
the course of events in the manner to which we have become
accustomed during our long love affair with natural science for
the simple reason that reflexive processes cannot be explained
and predicted in that Aanner. A different approach is needed and
this book is an attempt to develop one. It is best regarded as part
of a process of discoveky rather than the finished product.
All this makes for a difficult, dense book, although I can prom-
ise the reader that nothing in the rest of the book is quite as dense
as this introduction. I explore a complex subject. I bring a com-
plex mind to bear on it. I can argue in my defensethat the com-
plexity of my thinking mirrors the complexity of the financial
markets rather well, as demonstrated by the financial outcome
of the real-time experiment. There is, therefore, at least a prima
facie case fcrr giving me 3 hearicg. I shall t-ry ncii to abuse the pdv-
ilege.
It may be helpful if I sketch out the structure of the book. Part I
propounds the theory, The first chapter deals with the concept of
reflexivity in general terms and explores the difficulties in under-
standing reflexive phenomena. In particular, it argues that the
symmetry between explanation and prediction that characterizes
the laws of natural science is not attainable. The next three chap-
ters apply the theory to the financial markets: Chapter 2 to the
stock market and Chapter 3 to the currency market, with Chapter
4 outlining a credit and regulatory cycle.
Part I1 seeks to explain contemporary economic and financial
history using the hypotheses outlined in Chapter 4. The history

is, of necessity, selective, concentrating on those developments
4 that are relevant to the concept of a credit and regulatory cycle.
My main topics are banking, international lending, and merger-
mania.
Part I11 consists of a real-time experiment which is both test and
prediction at the same time. As a test it does not qualify as a
scientific one by the standards of natural science; but it may serve
as an example of how theories about reflexive developments can
be tested.
Part IV evaluates the results of the real-time experiment. Chap-
ter 15 explores the scope for what I provocatively call alchemy.
The real-time experiment can be regarded zs. sr, zxercisa in =0. nor?_
cia1 alchemy. Chapter 16 examines the limitations of social sci-
ence.
t
Part V seeks to provide some prescriptions for economic policy.
Chapter 17 examines the relative merits of free markets and regu-
lation, and Chapter 18 argues in favor of an international central
bank. Since both the market mechanism and the attempts to reg-
ulate it are inherently flawed, it may be argued that all attempts
at systemic reform are doomed to failure. I reject that argument in
Chapter 19.
In the Epilogue I explore the implications of the concept of
reflexivity outside the sphere of finance and in a final flight of
fancy I attempt to provide my own answers to some age-old meta-
physical questions.
Since my thinking has evolved in the course of writing, it may
be helpful for the reader to know when the various chapters were
written. The first part of the book was completed before I em-
barked on the real-time experiment in, Aug~st1 985. Mcreovei,
Chapters 5-9, which deal with recent history, preceded in time
Chapter 4, which outlines the concept of the credit and regulatory
cycle. Chapter 4 incorporates discoveries I made in the course of
writing; that is why it is so tentative in character.
I should like to emphasize that this book is not meant to pro-
vide a practical guide to getting rich in the stock market. Most of
what 1 know is in the book, at least in theoretical form. I have not
kept anything deliberately hidden. But the chain of reasoning
operates in the opposite direction: I am not trying to explain how
to use my approach to make money; rather, I am using my expe-
riences in the financial markets to develop an approach to the

study of historical processes in general and the present historical
moment in particulai. If I did not believe that my investment
activities can serve that purpose, I would not want to write about
them. As long as I am actively engaged in business, I would be
better off to keep theq a trade secret. But I would value it much
more highly than any'business success if I could contribute to an
understanding of the~worldi n which we live or, better yet, if I
could help to preserve the economic and political system that has
allowed me to flourish as a participant.

THE THEORY OF REFLEXIVITY
Economic theory is devoted to the study of equilibrium positions.
The concept of an equilibrium is very useful. It allows us to focus
on the final outcome rather than on the process that leads up to
it. But the concept is also very deceptive. It has the aura of some-
thing empirical: since the adjustment process is supposed to lead
to an equilibrium, an equilibrium position seems somehow im-
plicit in our observations. That is not true. Equilibrium itself has
rarely been observed in real life-market prices hwe a notorious
habit of fluctuating. The process that can be observed is supposed
to move toward an equilibrium. Why is it that the equilibrium is
never reached? It is true that market participants adjust to market
prices Llit they may be adjusting to a constaxitly moving talgei. In
that case, calling the participants' behavior an adjustment process
may be a misnomer and equilibrium theory becomes irrelevant to
the real world.
Equilibrium is the product of an axiomatic system. Economic
theory is constructed like logic or mathematics: it is based on
certain postulates and all of its conclusions are derived from them
by logical manipulation. The possibility that equilibrium is never
reached need not invalidate the logical construction, but when a
hypothetical equilibrium is presented as a model of reality a sig-
nificant distortion is introduced. If we lived in a world in which
the angles of a triangle did not add up to 180 degrees, Euclidean
geometry would constitute such a misleading model.



==================================================
                     PAGE 33                      
==================================================

28 Theory
The crowning achievement of the axiomatic approach is the
theory of perfect cgmpetition. Although it was first propounded
nearly two hundred years ago, it has never been superseded; only
the method of analysis has been refined. The theory holds that
under certain specified circumstances the unrestrained pursuit of
self-interest leads 40 the optimum allocation of resources. The
equilibrium point is reached when each firm produces at a level
where its margina1;cost equals the market price and each con-
sumer buys an amount whose marginal "utility" equals the mar-
ket price. Analysis shows that the equilibrium position
maximizes the benefit of all participants, provided no individual
buyer or seller can ihfluence market prices. It is this line of argu-
ment thaihas served as the theoretical underpinning for the lais-
sez-faire policies of the nineteenth century, and it is also the basis
of the current belief in the "magic of the marketplace."
Let us examine the main assumptions of the theory of perfect
competition. Those that are spelled out include perfect knowl-
edge; homogeneous ,and divisible products; and a large enough
number of participarjts so that no single participant can influence
the market price.
The assumption of perfect knowledge is suspect because under-
standing a situation in which one participates cannot qualify as
knowledge. That was the assumption that I found so unacceptable
as a student. I have Lo doubt that classical economists used the
assumption in exactly that sense in which I found it objectionable
because nineteenth-century thinkers were less aware of the limi-
tations of knowledge than we are today. As the epistemological
problems began to surface, exponents of the theory found that
they could get by using a more modest word: inforrrlction. In its
modern formulation the theory merely postulates perfect infor-
mation.'
Unfortunately, this assumption is not quite sufficient to support
the construction of the theory. To make up for the deficiency,
modern economists resorted to an ingenious device: they insisted
that the demand and supply curves should be taken as given.
They did not present this as a postulate; rather, they based their
claim on methodological grounds. They argued that the task of
economics is to study the relationship between supply and de-
mand and not either by itself. Demand may be a suitable subject
for psychologists, supply may be the province of engineers or
management scientists; both are beyond the scope of economic^.^
Therefore, both must be taken as given.

==================================================

The Theory of Reflexivity 29
Yet, if we stop to ask what it means that the conditions of
I supply and demand are independently given, it is clear that an
additional assumption has been introduced. Otherwise, where
would those curves come from? We are dealing with an as-
sumption disguised as a methodological device. Participants
are supposed to choose between alternatives in accordance
with their scale of preferences. The unspoken assumption is that
the participants know what those preferences and alternatives
are.
As I shall try to show, this assumption is untenable. The shape
of the supply and demand curves cannot be taken as indepen-
dently given, because both of them incorporate the participants'
expectations about events that are shaped by their own expecta-
tions.
I
Nowhere is the role of expectations more clearly visible than in
financial markets. Buy and sell decisions are based on expecta-
tions about future prices, and future prices, in turn, are contingent
on present buy and sell decisions. To speak of supply and de-
mand as if they were determined by forces that are independent
of the market participants' expectations is quite misleading. The
situation is not quite so clear-cut in the case of commodities,
where supply is largely dependent on production and demand on
consumption. But the price that determines the amounts pro-
duced and consumed is not necessarily the present price. On the
contrary, market participants are more likely to be guided by fu-
ture prices, either as expressed in futures marketg or as antici-
pated by themselves. In either case, it is inappropriate to speak of
independently given supply and demand curves because both
curves incorporate the participants' expectations about future
prices.
The very idea that events in the marketplace may affect the
shape of the demand and supply curves seems incongruous to
those who have been reared on classical economics. The demand
and supply curves are supposed to determine the market price. If
they were themselves subject to market influences, prices would
cease to be uniquely determined. Instead of equilibrium, we
would be left with fluctuating prices. This would be a devastating
state of affairs. All the conclusions of economic theory would lose
their relevance to the real world.
It is to prevent this outcome that the methodological device that
treats the supply and demand curves as independently given was
introduced. Yet there is something insidious about using a meth-

odological device to obscure an assumption that would be unten-
able if it were spelled out. To preserve the integrity of economic
theory as an axiomatic system, its assumptions ought to be ex-
plicitly stated. We may then conclude that economic theory is no
more relevant to the real world than non-Euclidean geometry, but
at least we would know where we stand. Instead, we have been
deceived by a methodological subterfuge. The demand and sup-
ply curves are prpsented in textbooks as though they were
grounded in empirical evidence. But there is scant evidence for
independently given demand and supply curves. Anyone who
trades in markets where prices are continuously changing knows
that participants are very much influenced by market develop-
ments. Rising prices ~jfteild itraci buyers and vice versa. How
could self-reinforcing trends persist if supply and demand curves
were independent of market prices? Yet, even a cursory look at
commodity, stock, and currency markets confirms that trends are
the rule rather than )he exception.
The theory of perfect competition could be defended by arguing
that the trends we can observe in commodity and financial mar-
kets are merely temporary aberrations which will be eliminated
in the long run by the "fundamental" forces of supply and de-
mand. It should be remembered that the theory of perfect compe-
tition does not claim to define the path of adjustment; it merely
analyzes the situation after all the adjustments have taken place.
The trouble with the argument is that there can be no assurance
that "fundamental" forces will correct "speculative" excesses. It
is just as possible that speculation will alter the supposedly fun-
damental conditions of supply and demand.
In the normal course of events, a speculative price rise provokes
countervailing forcss: suppiy is increased and demand reduced,
and the temporary excess is corrected with the passage of time.
But there are exceptions. In foreign exchange, for example, a sus-
tained price movement can be self-validating, because of its im-
pact on domestic price levels. The same is true in the stock market
where the performance of a stock may affect the performance of
the company in question in a number of ways. And in examining
the recent history of international lending we shall find that ex-
cessive lending first increased the borrowing capacity of debtor
countries, as measured by their debt ratios, and then, when the
banks wanted to be repaid, the debtor countries' ability to do so
evaporated. Generally speaking, we shall find that the expansion

and contraction of credit can affect the debtors' ability and will-
ingness to pay.
I
Are these exceptions that confirm the rule, or do they necessi-
tate a revision of accepted theory? The answer depends on the
frequency and severity of their occurrence. If we are dealing with
an isolated instance, we can treat it as a paradox; but if one inci-
dent follows another, we must question the theory.
I contend that such paradoxical behavior is typical of all finan-
cial markets that serve as a discounting mechanism for future
developments, notably stock markets, foreign exchange markets,
banking, and all forms of credit. Microeconomic theory may
continue to ignore it, because there are large areas of economic
activity where it occurs only occasionally or not at all; b&-we
cannot expect to understand macroeconomic developments with-
I out taking the phenomenon into account. A world of fluc-
tuating exchange rates and large-scale capital movements is
characterized by vicious and benign circles in which the "nor-
mal" pattern of causation, as defined by classical economics,
seems to be reversed: market developments dictate the evolu-
tion of the conditions of supply and demand, not the other way
around.
If the process of adjustment does not lead to an equilibrium,
what happens to the conclusions of economic theory? The answer
is that they remain valid as deductions but they lose their rele-
vance to the real world. If we want to understand the real world,
we must divert our gaze from a hypothetical fins outcome and
concentrate our attention on the process of change that we can
observe all around us.
This will require a radical shift in our thinking. A process of
change is much more difficult to understand than a static equilib-
rium. We shall have to revise many of our preconceived ideas
about the kind of understanding that is attainable and satisfy our-
selves with conclusions that are far less definite than those that
economic theory sought to provide.
The Problem of Imperfect Understanding
The understanding of the actual course of events, as distinct from
a hypothetical equilibrium, poses problems that have not been
properly appreciated. The problems arise because participants

base their decisions on an inherently imperfect understanding of
the situation in which they participate. There are two related sets
4 of problems to be considered: the imperfect understanding of the
participant and the imperfect understanding of the social scien-
tist. We must be careful not to confuse the two.
In this section I shall try to explain why the participants' un-
derstanding is inherently imperfect. In the next section I shall
examine why the imperfect understanding of the participants
poses difficulties for the social sciences.
The imperfect understanding of the participant is a difficult
concept to define and an even more difficult one to work with. I
shall try to approach it by comparing the position of the partici-
pant vlth that of ;. naturdl scientist. (4 have to specify a natural
scientist, because social scientists are confronted with special
problems arising out of the imperfect understanding of partici-
pants. These will be dealt with in the next section.) The purpose
of the comparison is to establish a standard in terms of which the
understanding of the participant can be called imperfect. What
makes the comparison tricky is that the natural scientist is not
capable of perfect understanding either. Far from it. As Karl Pop-
per has shown,3i t is a cardinal principle of scientific method that
perfect knowledge is not attainable. Scientists work by constantly
testing plausible hypotheses and propounding new ones. If they
did not treat all conclusions as provisional and subject to im-
provement, natural science could not have reached its present
state of development and it could not progess any further. Al-
though it is far from perfect, the knowledge attained by natural
scientists provides a standard in terms of which the participants'
understanding can be called imperfect.
Natural scie~tfstsh ave oue great advantage over participants:
they deal with phenomena that occur independently of what any-
body says or thinks about them. The phenomena belong to one
universe, the scientists' statements to another. The phenomena
then serve as an independent, objective criterion by which the
truth or validity of scientific statements can be judged. Statements
that correspond to the facts are true; those that do not are false.
To the extent that the correspondence can be established, the
scientist's understanding qualifies as knowledge. We do not need
to go into the various difficulties that stand in the way of estab-
lishing the correspondence. The important point is that scientists
have an objective criterion at their disposal.

==================================================

The Theory of Reflexivity 3 3
By contrast, the situation to which the participants' thinking
relates is not independently given: it is contingent on their own
decisions. As an objective criterion for establishing the truth or
validity of the participants' views, it is deficient. It does provide
a criterion of sorts: some expectations are validated by subsequent
events, others are not: But the process of validation leaves some-
thing to be desired: one can never be sure whether it is the expec-
tation that corresponds to the subsequent event or the subsequent
event that conforms to the expectation. The segregation between
thoughts and events that prevails in natural science is simply
missing.
Thinking plays a dual role. On the one hand, participants seek
to understand the situation in which they participate; on the
other, their understanding serves as the basis of decisions which
influence the course of events. The two roles interfere with each
other. Neither role is 'performed as well as it could be if it were
performed separately. If the course of events were independent of
the participants' decisions, the participants' understanding could
equal that of a naturbl scientist; and if participants could base
their decisions on knowledge, however provisional, the results of
their actions would have a better chance of corresponding to their
intentions. As it is, participants act on the basis of imperfect un-
derstanding and the course of events bears the imprint of. that
imperfection.
In a milder form, the lack of separation betwmn the subject
matter and the act of thinking may also arise in natural science.
The most celebrated example is in quantum physics where the
act of observation interferes with the observed phenomenon. It
has given rSss to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle which, in
effect, establishes a limit to the scientist's ability to attain knowl-
edge. But in natural science the problem occurs only at the limit,
whereas for the participant it is at the very center of his thinking.
For one thing, the scientist makes a deliberate attempt not to
interfere with his subject matter, whereas the participant's pri-
mary purpose is to mold the situation in which he participates to
his own satisfaction. More important, in quantum physics it is
only the act of observation which interferes with the subject mat-
ter, not the theory of uncertainty, whereas in the case of thinking
participants their own thoughts form part of the subject matter to
which they relate. The positive accomplishments of natural sci-
ence are confined to the area where thinking and events are effec-

tively segregated. When events have thinking participants that
area shrinks to the vanishing point.
The Problem of the Social Sciences
We are now in a position to examine the problems of the social
sciences. Again, there are two distinct issues to be considered.
One relates to the subject matter, the other to the observer.
Scientific method is designed to deal with facts; but, as we have
seen, events which have thinking participants do not consist of
facts alone. The participant's thinking plays a causal rda, ye; i1
does not correspond to the facts for the simple reason that it does
not relate to facts. Participants have to deal with a situation that
is contingent on their own decisions; their thinking constitutes
an indispensable ingredient in that situation. Whether we treat it
as a fact of a special kind or something other than a fact, the
participants' thinking introduces an element of uncertainty into
the subject matter. This element is absent in the natural sciences.
As we have seen, there is some similarity between the uncertainty
introduced by the participants' thinking and Heisenberg's uncer-
tainty principle in quantum physics but, as we shall soon see, the
parallel is misleading.
Now for the role of the scientific observer: it is much easier to
maintain the required segregation between facts and statements
when the subject matter itself does not contain any statements,
observations, or thoughts of any kind.
Most discussions about the shortcomings of the social sciences
have focused on the second issue. Expressioris like "self-fulf lling
prophecies" or "self-defeating experiments" are widely used
but usually they relate to the would-be scientist. Yet it is the
self-influencing character of the participants' thinking that is re-
sponsible for the element of uncertainty (or indeterminacy) I men-
tioned before. The difficulties of scientific observation pale into
insignificance when compared with the indeterminacy of the sub-
ject matter. The indeterminacy would remain even if all the prob-
lems relating to the observer were resolved, whereas the problems
of the observer can be directly attributed to the indeterminacy of
the subject matter. Thus the problem of the social sciences is not
merely methodological but inherent in the subject matter.
The undue emphasis on the role of the scientific observer can

The Theory of Reflexivity 3 5
be attributed to the false analogy with Heisenberg's uncertainty
principle. I am no expert in quantum physics but, as I understand
it, the principle holds that the mass and velocity of quantum
particles cannot be measured at the same time because the act of
measurement interfergs with the object that is being measured. In
this case, the element*o f uncertainty is introduced by the outside
observer. (Whether tlje behavior of quantum particles is inher-
ently random is a separate question.) The parallel with the social
sciences is misleading because in the latter case the indetermi-
nacy (uncertainty) is caused by the partikipants. Only if quantum
particles behaved as' thinking participants would the analogy
hold.
I shall try to reverse the discussion to its proper order: the
uncertainty in the subject matter first, the role of the scientist
second.
The idea that there' is a fundamental difference in the subject
matter of the natural sand social sciences has not been generally
recognized. On the ccjntrary, Karl Popper, whom I otherwise ad-
mire, enunciated what he called the "doctrine of the unity of
~cience"t;h~a t is, the same methods and criteria apply in both the
natural and social sciences. Although it has not been universally
accepted, it has not been conclusively refuted either. 1 shall try to
do so here.
In order to appreciate the problem posed by thinking partici-
pants, let us take a closer look at the way scientifi95 method oper-
ates. For this purpose I am invoking Karl Popper's scheme of
scientific method, described in technical terms as the "deductive-
nomological," or "D-N," model. Like every model, it presents a
simplified and idealized version of a more comi;lex reiility, but
exactly because it is simple and elegant it suits my purpose very
well.
The model is built on three kinds of statements: specific initial
conditions, specific final conditions, and generalizations of uni-
versal validity. Combining a set of generalizations with known
initial conditions yields predictions; combining them with
known final conditions provides explanations; and matching
known initial with known final conditions serves as testing for
the generalizations involved. It can be seen that there is a sym-
metry between predictions and explanations; they are logically
reversible. Testing is different, because no amount of testing can
prove that a generalization is universally valid. Scientific theories

can only be falsified, never verified. The asymmetry between
verification and falsification and the symmetry between predic-
tion and explanation are the two crucial features of Popper's
scheme.
The model works only if certain conditions are fulfilled. An
essential condition is that the content of the statements should
exist in total isolation from the statements that are made about
them; only then does the content provide an independent crite-
rion for judging the truth or validity of the statements that relate
to it.* Other essential requirements are that the initial and final
conditions should consist of facts which are amenable to scien-
tific observation and the generalizations should, have universal
validity. That is, if a given set of conditions recurred, it would
have to be followed or preceded by the same set of conditions as
before. It can be seen that the requirement of universal validity
defines not only the nature of scientific laws but also the character
of initial and final conditions: they must consist of observable
facts governed by universal laws. It is this requirement that is so
difficult to meet when a situation has thinking participants.
What constitutes scientific observation is a matter of debate that
we need not enter into here. Clearly, a single observation by a
single scientist is not admissible. Exactly because the correspon-
dence between facts and statements is so difficult to establish,
science is a collective enterprise where the work of each scientist
has to be open to control and criticism by others.
The interaction between scientists is governed by certain con-
ventions. These conventions are neither clearly defined nor per-
manently fixed. They derive their authority from the fact that fiey
produce desired results. Individual scientists often find the con-
ventions quite onerous and try various shortcuts in order to attain
a desired result. Only because the shortcuts do not work do the
conventions of scientific method continue to prevail.
Perhaps the most outstanding example of the observer trying to
impose his will on his subject matter is the attempt to convert
base metal into gold. Alchemists struggled long and hard until
they were finally persuaded to abandon their enterprise by their
* Interestingly, this condition holds not only for the facts that constitute the
initial and final conditions but also for the generalizations that connect them.
The laws of nature must prevail whether they are recognized or not. This is the
basis of Popper's abortive idea of a "third world" of objective thoughts (in
Objective Knowledge, New York: Oxford University Press, 1972).

lack of success. The lailure was inevitable because the behavior
of base metals is governed by laws of universal validity which
cannot be modified by any statements, incantations, or rituals.
Let us now consider the behavior of human beings. Do they
obey universally valid laws that can be formulated in accordance
with the D-N model? Undoubtedly, there are many aspects of
human behavior, from birth to death and in between, which are
amenable to the same treatment as other natural phenomena. But
there is one aspect of human behavior which seems to exhibit
characteristics different from those of the phenomena which form
the subject matter of natural science: the decision-making pro-
cess. Decisions are based on an imperfect understanding of the
situation. How does such a situation provide the initial and final
conditions which are supposed to be connected according to laws
of universal validity? Do those conditions include or exclude the
participants' thinking? If thinking is included, the conditions are
not amenable to scientific observation, because only the effects of
the participants' thinking can be observed, not the process itself.
If the thinking process is excluded and only its effects are admit-
ted as evidence, the universal validity of scientific generalizations
is destroyed because a given set of conditions is not necessarily
preceded or succeeded by the same set every time: the sequence
of events is influenced by the participants' thinking, yet there is a
lack of correspondence between the participants' thinking and
the course of events. In either case, the D-N modabreaks down.
This may not be the end of the world, but it is a serious blow to
scientific method. The method has been so successful that we find
it hard to believe that there should be a large and vital area be-
yond its scope. Natural science has aiso encountered limitations
in the form of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle but the limits
were reached only after a number of impressive accomplishments
-the uncertainty principle itself counts as one of the great dis-
coveries of natural science. In social science we encounter diffi-
culties even before we get started: the imperfect understanding of
the participants is incompatible with the D-N model.
This conclusion is so devastating that every effort has been
made to escape it. To review the various attempts would take a
whole book-and an interesting one at that. I shall confine my
attention to economic theory, which constitutes one of the most
ingenious attempts, and in some ways the most effective one, to
escape the problems connected with imperfect understanding. It

simply assumes away the problems by erecting a hypothetical
system in which the participants' decisions are fully determined
by the available information. This approach yields conclusions
which meet some of the requirements of the D-N model. For in-
stance, the theory of perfect competition qualifies as universally
valid and-at least in principle-it can be used to explain and
predict conditions with equal force. The theory fails, however,
when it comes to testing, leaving in doubt the relevance of the
hypothetical to actual conditions.
Social scientists have gone to great lengths trying to maintain
the unity of method but with remarkably little success. Their
endeavors have yielded little more than a parody of natural sci-
ence. In a sense, the attempt to impose the methods of natural
science on social phenomena is comparable to the efforts of alche-
mists who sought to apply the methods of magic to the field of
natural science. But while the failure of the alchemists was well-
nigh total, social scientists have maqaged to make a considerable
impact on their subject matter. situations which have thinking
participants may be impervious to the methods of natural'science,
but they are susceptible to the methods of alchemy. The thinking
of participants, exactly because it is not governed by reality, is
easily influenced by theories. In the field of natural phenomena,
scientific method is effective only when its theories are valid; but
in social, political, and economic matters, theories can be effec-
tive without being valid. Whereas alchemy has failed as natural
science, social science can succeed as alchemy.
This brings us to an examination of the relationship between
the scientist and his subject matter. As we have seen, the ID-N
model requires that scie2iists keep their statements and observa-
tions rigorously segregated from the subject matter to which they
relate; only then can the subject matter fulfill its function and
serve as an objective criterion for judging the truth or validity of
scientific statements. The conventions of scientific method are
designed to maintain the required segregation.
In natural science the conventions are effective because the
scientist's thinking is, in fact, distinct from its subject matter. The
scientist can influence the subject matter only by actions, not by
thoughts, and the scientist's actions are guided by the same laws
as all other natural phenomena. Specifically, nothing the scientist
can do will turn base metals into gold. The scientist may gain
some personal advantage by flouting the conventions of science,

but the advantage is achieved only by a deception which is liable
to be revealed by those who abide by the conventions.
Social phenomena are different. The imperfect understanding
of the participant interferes with the proper functioning of the
D-N model. This has far-reaching implications for the conven-
tions of scientific method. It limits the results that can be pro-
duced by observing thk conventions and, what is worse, it opens
the way to attaining worthwhile results by transgressing them.
There is much to be gained by pretending to abide by the conven-
tions of scientific method without actually doing so. Natural sci-
ence is held in great esteem: a theory that claims to be scientific
can influence the gullible public much better than one whicn
frankly admits its political or ideological bias. I only need to
mention Marxism and psychoanalysis as typical examples; but
laissez-faire capitalism, with its reliance on the theory of perfect
competition, is also a: case in point. It is noteworthy that both
Marx and Freud were vocal in protesting their scientific status
and based many of their conclusions on the authority they de-
rived from being "scientific." Once this point sinks in, the very
expression "social science" becomes suspect. It is a magic word
employed by social alchemists in their effort to impose their will
on their subject matter by incantation.
How can the "true" practitioners of scientific method protect
themselves against such malpractice? It seems to me that there is
only one way out: to deprive social science of theeatus it enjoys
on account of natural science. Social science ought to be recog-
nized as a false metaphor.
That does not mean that we must give up the pursuit of truth
in exploring social phenomena. It means only that the pursuit of
truth requires us to recognize that the D-N model does not apply
to situations with thinking participants. We must abandon the
doctrine of the unity of method and cease the slavish imitation of
natural science.
The D-N model has been so successful in natural science that it
has come to be equated with scientific method. Ironically, the
model has been largely superseded in modern natural science; the
social sciences, however, are still trying to compete with the ac-
complishments of nineteenth-century natural science. The at-
tempt is in vain because, as we have seen, the subject matter does
not fit the D-N mold. But, as quantum physics has shown, scien-
tific method is not necessarily confined to the D-N model: statis-

tical, probabilistic generalizations may prove more fruitful. Nor
should we ignore the possibility of developing novel approaches
which have no counterpart in natural science. Given the differ-
ences in subject matter, there ought to be differences in the
method of study.
I shall explore a novel approach in this book, but before I start,
I want to make sure that it will not be judged by the standards of
the D-N model. A world of imperfect understanding does not lend
itself to generalizations which can be used to explain and to pre-
dict specific events. The symmetry between explanation and pre-
diction prevails only in the absence of thinking participants.
Otherwise, predictions must always be conditioned on the partic-
ipants' perceptions; thus they cannot have the finality which they
enjoy in the D-N model. On the other hand, past events are just as
final as in the D-N model; thus, ex*nation turns out to be an
easier task than prediction. Once we abandon the constraint that
predictions and explanations are logically reversible, we can
build a theoretical framework which is appropriate to the subject
matter. Unfortunately, the theory cannot be tested in the same
way ;as those which fit into Popper's logical structure. That is not
to say that testing must be abandoned; on the contrary, as long as
we remain concerned with understanding things as they are, we
ought to insist on testing our views. We need to develop novel
ways of testing. I shall do so in the real-time experiment that
frankly admits, and exploits, the alchemical potential in the study
of social phenomena (Part 111).
The Participants' Bias
My approach is to tackle the problem of imperfect understanding
head on. What makes the participants' understanding imperfect
is that their thinking affects the situation to which it relates. The
causal role played by the participants' thinking has no counter-
part in the phenomena studied by natural scientists. It is ob-
viously not the only force shaping the course of events, but it is a
force which is unique to events that have thinking participants.
Hence it deserves to take center stage.
As we have seen, imperfect understanding is a very difficult
concept to work with. We have established that there is a lack of
correspondence between the participant's thinking and the situa-



==================================================
                     PAGE 46                      
==================================================

The Theory of Reflexivity 41
tion to which it relates; but the lack of correspondence is difficult
to define, let alone measure. The participant's thinking is part of
the situation to which it relates and the very idea of correspon-
dence is inappropriate to describing a relationship between a part
and a whole. The idea :was imported from natural science, where
facts and statements belong to separate universes and from phi-
losophy, where correspondence serves as the criterion of truth.
The analogy does not apply to the participant who is, by defini-
tion, part of the situation that he is trying to understand. We can
speak of a lack of correspondence, but we cannot define that to
which the participant's understanding fails to correspond be-
cause it sillrply does dot exist. To simplify rn~tttzrs,I sha!! speak
of an inherent bias in the participants' thinking. Since the bias is
inherent, the unbiased is unattainable.
There is, however, a norm in the outside world against which
the participants' bias can be measured. Although there is no real-
ity independent of the participants*p erception, there is a reality
that is dependent on ;it. In other words, there is a sequence of
events that actually occurs and that sequence reflects the partici-
pants' behavior. The actual course of events is likely to differ from
the participants' expectations and the divergence can be taken as
an indication of the participants' bias. Unfortunately, it can be
taken only as an indication-not as the full measure of the bias-
because the actual course of events already incorporates the ef-
fects of the participants' thinking. Thus the participants' bias
finds expression both in the divergence between outcome and
expectations and in the actual course of events. A phenomenon
that is partially observable and partially submerged in the course
of events does not lend itself readily to scientific investigatiorr.
We can now appreciate why economists were so anxious to elim-
inate it from their theories. We shall make it the focal point of our
investigation.
The Concept of Reflexivity
The connection between the participants' thinking and the situa-
tion in which they participate can be broken up into two func-
tional relationships. I call the participants' efforts to understand
the situation the cognitive or passive function and the impact of
their thinking on the real world the participating or active func-



==================================================
                     PAGE 47                      
==================================================

42 Theory
tion. In the cognitive function, the participants' perceptions de-
I pend on the situation; in the participating function, the situation
is influenced by the participants' perceptions. It can be seen that
the two functions work in opposite directions: in the cognitive
function the independent variable is the situation; in the partici-
pating function it is the participants' thinking.
There are many cases where one or the other function can be
observed in isolation but there are also instances where they are
both operating at the same time. An obvious example of the cog-
nitive function is when someone learns from experience. Exam-
ples of the participating function are to be found in textbooks of
economics where the participants apply a given set of preferences
to a given set of opportunities and in the process determine
prices.
4
When both functions operate at the same time, they interfere
with each other. Functions need an independent variable in order
to produce a determinate result, but in this case the independent
variable of one function is the dependent variable of the other.
Instead of a determinate result, we have an interplay in which
both the situation and the participants' views are dependent vari-
ables so that an initial change precipitates further changes both in
the situation and in the participants' views. I call this interaction
"reflexivity," using the word as the French do when they describe
a verb whose subject and object are the same. Using simple math-
ematics, reflexivity can be depicted as a pair of recursive func-
tions:
y = f (x) cognitive function
+
x = (yj partlcipati~~fgu nction
Therefore,
This is the theoretical foundation of my approach. The two
recursive functions do not produce an equilibrium but a never-
ending process of change. The process is fundamentally different
from the processes that are studied by natural science. There, one
set of facts follows another without any interference from

tion introduces uncertqinty). When a situation has thinking par-
ticipants, the sequence of events does not lead directly from one
set of facts to the next; rather, it connects facts to perceptions and
perceptions to facts in a shoelace pattern. Thus, the concept of
reflexivity yields a "shoelace" theory of history.
It must be recognized that the shoelace theory is a kind of di-
alectic. It can be intergreted as a synthesis of Hegel's dialectic of
ideas and Marx's dialectical materialism. Instead of either
thoughts or material conditions evolving in a dialectic fashion on
their own, it is the interplay between the two that produces a
dialectic process. The' only reason I do not use the word more
prominently is that I do not want .icu be burdened by the excess ,
luggage that comes with it. I find Hegel obscure, and Marx pro-
pounded a deterministic theory of history that is diametrically
opposed to my own view.
The historical process, as I see it, is open ended. Its main driv-
ing force is the participants' bias. To be sure, it is not the only
force at work, but it js a force that is unique to the historical
process and sets it apart from the processes studied by natural
science. Biological evblution is attributed to genetic mutation; I
contend that historical processes are shaped by the misconcep-
tions of the participants. I would even go as far as to say that the
ideas that make histor) consist of fertile fallacies. A fertile fallacy
is originally conceived as an insight; only when it is translated
into reality do its shortcomings become apparenMt then begets
another fertile fallacy that is antithetical to it, and so it goes. Each
fallacy provides a new experience and, to the extent that people
learn from experience, the process can be described as progress.
Fallacy is, of course, too strong a word, but it is helpful in direct-
ing attention in the right direction: to the participants' bias.
I shall not pursue the subject further here, but it is obvious that
the concept of reflexivity, as described here, has implications far
beyond the range of topics tackled in this book.
Reflexivity Versus Equilibrium
Returning to economic theory, it can be argued that it is the par-
ticipants' bias that renders the equilibrium position unattainable.
The target toward which the adjustment process leads incorpo-
rates a bias, and the bias may shift in the process. When that

happens, the process aims not at an equilibrium but at a moving
target.
To put matters into perspective, we may classify events into
two categories: humdrum, everyday events that are correctly an-
ticipated by the participants and do not provoke a change in their
perceptions, and unique, historical events that affect the partici-
pants' bias and lead to further changes. The first kind of event is
susceptible to equilibrium analysis, the second is not: it can be
understood only as part of a historical process.
In everyday events, only the participating function is operative;
the cognitive function is given. In the case of unique, historic
developments, both functions operate simuitaneously so that nei-
ther the participants' views nor the situation to which they relate
remain the same as they were before. That is what justifies de-
scribing such developments as historic.
It should be emphasized that my definition of historical change
involves a tautology. First, I classify events according to their
'
effect on the participants' bias: those that alter the participant's
bias are historic and those that do not are humdrum. I then claim
that it is changes in the participants' bias that qualify a course of
events as historical.
Tautologies can be useful, provided they are recognized as
such. In this case it helps to put equilibrium analysis into the
proper perspective. I have defined historical change as an inter-
play between the cognitive and participating functions. What
makes the change historical is that it affects both the course of
events and the participants' perceptions so that the next event
cannot be a mere repetition of the one that preceded 'it.
Equilibrium analysis eliminates historical change by assum-
ming away the cognitive function. The supply and demand curves
utilized by economic theory are expressions of the participating
function only. The cognitive function is replaced by the assump-
tion of perfect knowledge. If the cognitive function were operat-
ing, events in the marketplace could alter the shape of the demand
and supply curves, and the equilibrium studied by economists
need never be reached.
How significant is the omission of the cognitive function? In
other words, how significant is the distortion introduced by ne-
glecting the participants' bias?
In microeconomic analysis, the distortion is negligible and the
participants' bias can be accounted for easily. As a first step, the

==================================================

The Theory of Reflexivity 45
participants' bias can be taken as given: that provides a static
equilibrium. To make the analysis more dynamic, changes in the
participants' bias can be added piecemeal, expressed as changes
in consumer habits or production methods. All that is obscured
by this piecemeal approach is the possible connection between
the various changes in the conditions of supply and demand, but
that omission does nbt invalidate the conclusions microeconomic
analysis seeks to establish.
When it comes to financial markets, the distortion is more seri-
ous. The participants' bias is an element in determining prices
and no important niarket development leaves the participants'
bias unaffected. The'search for an equilibrium price turns out to
be a wild goose chase and theories about the equilibrium price
can themselves become a fertile source of bias. To paraphrase J.
P. Morgan, financial markets will continue to fluctuate.
In trying to deal with macroeconomic developments, equilib-
rium analysis is totally inappropriate. Nothing could be further
removed from reality than the assumption that participants base
their decisions on perfect knowledge. People are groping to antic-
ipate the future with the help of whatever guideposts they can
establish. The outcome tends to diverge from expectations, lead-
ing to constantly chgnging expectations and constantly changing
outcomes. The process is reflexive.
In his General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money,
Keynes managed to show that full employmentT%a special case;
if we could develop a general theory of reflexivity, equilibrium
would appear as a special case. While it will hardly qualify as a
general theory, I shall try to explore the role of reflexivity in
financial markets; that means that I shall try to inierpret their
functioning as a historical process.

REFLEXIVITY LN THE STOCK MARKET
In trying to develop a theory of reflexivity, I shall start with the
stock market. For one thing, it is the market I am most familiar
with: I have been a professional investor for more than twenty- .
five years. For another, the stock market provides an excellent
laboratory for testing theories: changes are expressed in quantita-
tive terms and the data are easily accessible. Even the partici-
pants' views are usually available in the form of brokers' reports.
Most important, I have actually tested my theory in the stock
market and 1h ave some interesting case studies to present.
As I mentioned in the introduction, I did not develop my ideas
on reflexivity in connection with my activities in the stock mar-
ket. The theory of reflexivity started out as abstract philosophical
speculation and only gradually did I discover its ~ l e v ~ ntco et?a e
behavior of stock prices. I was singularly unsuccessful in formu-
lating my theory at the level of abstraction at which I conceived
it: my failure as a philosopher stands in stark contrast with my
career as an investment professional. I hope that by presenting
my ideas in the reverse order from the one in which I arrived at
them I may be able to avoid getting lost in arcane abstractions.
There is yet another reason why the stock market may provide
the best entry point for the study of reflexive phenomena. The
stock market comes as close to meeting the criteria of perfect
competition as any market: a central marketplace, homogeneous
products, low transaction and transportation costs, instant com-
munications, a large enough crowd of participants to ensure that
no individual can influence market prices in the ordinary course
of events, and special rules for insider transactions as well as

special safeguards to provide all participants with access to rele-
vant information. What more can one ask for? If there is any place
where the theory of perfect competition ought to beatranslated
into practice, it is in the stock market.
Yet there is little edpirical evidence of an equilibrium or even
a tendency for prices tp move toward an equilibrium. The concept
of an equilibrium seems irrelevant at best and misleading at
worst. The evidence shows persistent fluctuations, whatever
length of time is chosen as the period of observation. Admittedly,
the underlying conditions that are supposed to be reflected in
stock prices are also ,constantly changing, but it is difficult to
establish any firm relationship between changes in stock prices
and changes in underlying conditions. Whatever relationship can
be established has to be imputed rather than observed. I intend to
use the theory of reflexivity to criticize the preoccupation of eco-
nomic theory with the equilibrium position. What better example
could I find than the stock market?
Existing theories about the behavior of stock prices are remark-
ably inadequate. They are of so little value to the practitioner that
I am not even fully familiar with them. The fact that I could get
by without them speaks for itself.
Generally, theories fall into two categories: fundamentalist and
technical. More recently, the random walk theory has come into
vogue; this theory holds that the market fully discsunts all future
developments so that the individual participant's chances of
over- or underperforming the market as a whole are even. This
line of argument has served as theoretical justification for the
increasing number of institutions that inyest their money in index
funds. The theory is manifestly false-I have disproved it by con-
sistently outperforming the averages over a period of twelve
years. Institutions may be well advised to invest in index funds
rather than making specific investment decisions, but the reason
is to be found in their substandard performance, not in the impos-
sibility of outperforming the averages.
Technical analysis studies market patterns and the demand and
supply of stocks. It has undoubted merit in predicting probabili-
ties but not the actual course of events. For the purposes of this
discussion it is of no particular interest, because it has little the-
oretical foundation other than the assertions that stock prices are
determined by their supply and demand and that past experience
is relevant in predicting the future.
Fundamental analysis is more interesting because it is an out-

growth of equilibrium theory. Stocks are supposed to have a true
I or fundamental value as distinct from their current market price.
The fundamental value of a stock may be defined either in rela-
tion to the earning power of the underlying assets or in relation
to the fundamental value of other stocks. In either case, the mar-
ket price of a stock is supposed to tend toward its fundamental
value over a period of time so that the analysis of fundamental
values provides a useful guide to investment decisions.
The important point about this approach is that the connection
between stock prices and the companies whose stocks are traded
is assumed to be in one direction. The fortunes of the companies
determins--however belatedly-the relative values of the var-
ious stocks traded in the stock market. The possibility that stock
market developments may affect the fortunes of the companies is
left out of account. There is a clear parallel with the theory of
price where the indifference curve determines the relative
amounts consumed, and the possibility that the market may influ-
ence the indifference curve is disregarded. The parallel is not
accidental: the fundamentalist approach is based on the theory of
price. But the omission is more glaring in the stock market than
in other markets. Stock market valuations have a direct way of
influencing underlying values: through the issue and repurchase
of shares and options and through corporate transactions of all
kinds-mergers, acquisitions, going public, going private, and so
on. There are also more subtle ways in which stock prices may
influence the standing of a company: credit rating, consumer ac-
ceptance, management credibility, etc. The influence of these fac-
tors on stock prices is, of course, fully recognized; it is the
influence of stock pric2s on these factors that is so strangely ig-
nored by the fundamentalist approach.
If there are any glaring discrepancies between prevailing stock
prices and fundamental values, they are attributed to future de-
velopments in the companies concerned that are not yet known
but are correctly anticipated by the stock market. Movements in
stock prices are believed to precede the developments that sub-
sequently justify them. How future developments ought to be dis-
counted is the subject of an ongoing debate, but it is presumed
that the market is doing the job correctly even if the correct
method cannot be theoretically established. This point of view
follows naturally from the theory of perfect competition. It is
summed up in the assertion that "the market is always right." The

assertion is generally accepted, even by people who do not put
much faith in fundamental analysis.
I take a totally opposite point of view. I do not accept the prop-
osition that stock prices are a passive reflection of underlying
values, nor do I accept Rhe proposition that the reflection tends to
correspond to the underlying value. I contend that market valua-
tions are always distohed; moreover-and this is the crucial de-
parture from equilibrium theory-the distortions can affect the
underlying values. Stock prices are not merely passive reflections;
they are active ingredients in a process in which both stock prices
and the fortunes of the companies whose stocks are traded are
determined. In other words, I regard changes in stock prices as
part of a historical process and I focus on the discrepancy be-
tween the participants' expectations and the actual course of
events as a causal factor in that process.
To explain the process, I take the discrepancy as my starting
point. I do not rule out the possibility that events may actually
correspond to people's expectations, but I treat it as a limiting
case. Translating this assertion into market terms, I claim that
market participants are always biased in one way or another. I do
not deny that markets have a predictive or anticipating power that
seems uncanny at times, but I argue that it can be explained by
the influence that the participants' bias has on the course of
events. For instance, the stock market is generally believed to
anticipate recessions; it would be more correct to""say that it can
help to precipitate them. Thus I replace the assertion that markets
are always right with two others:
1. Markets are always biased in one direction or another.
2. Markets can influence the events that they anticipate.
The combination of these two assertions explains why markets
may so often appear to anticipate events correctly.
Using the participants' bias as our starting point, we can try to
build a model of the interaction between the participants' views
and the situation in which they participate. What makes the anal-
ysis so difficult is that the participants' views are part of the
situation to which they relate. To make any sense of such a com-
plex situation, we need to simplify it. I introduced a simplifying
concept when I spoke of the participants' bias. Now I want to take

                     PAGE 55                      
==================================================

50 Theory
the argument a step further and introduce the concept of a pre-
vailing bias.
Markets have many participants, whose views are bound to
differ. I shall assume that many of the individual biases cancel
each other out, leaving what I call the "prevailing bias." This
assumption is not appropriate to all historical processes but it
does apply to the stock market and to other markets as well. What
makes the procedure of aggregating individual perceptions legit-
imate is that they can be related to a common denominator,
namely, stock prices. In other historical processes, the partici-
pants' views are too diffuse to be aggregated and the concept of a
prevailing bias becomes !ittie more Clan a metaphor. In these
cases a different model may be needed, but in the stock market
the participants' bias finds expression in purchases and sales.
Other things being equal, a positive bias leads to rising stock
prices and a negative one to falling prices. Thus the prevailing
bias is an observable phenomenon.
Other things are, of course, never equal. We need to know a
little more about those "other things" in order to build our model.
At this point I shall introduce a second simplifying concept. I
shall postulate an "underlying trend" that influences the move-
ment of stock prices whether it is recognized by investors or not.
The influence on stock prices will, of course, vary, depending on
the market participants' views. The trend in stock prices can then
be envisioned as a composite of the "underlying trend" and the
"prevailing bias."
How do these two factors interact? It will be recalled that there
are two connections at play: the participating and the cognitive
functions. The underlying trend influences the participants' per-
ceptions through the cognitive function; the resulting change in
perceptions affects the situation through the participating func-
tion. In the case of the stock market, the primary impact is on
stock prices. The change in stock prices may, in tun, affect both
the participants' bias and the underlying trend.
We have here a reflexive relationship in which stock prices are
determined by two factors-underlying trend and prevailing bias
-both of which are, in turn, influenced by stock prices. The in-
terplay between stock prices and the other two factors has no
constant: what is supposed to be the independent variable in one
function is the dependent variable in the other. Without a con-
stant, there is no tendency toward equilibrium. The sequence of

events is best interpreted as a process of historical change in
which none of the variables-stock prices, underlying trend, and
prevailing bias-remains as it was before. In the typical sequence
the three variables reinforce each other first in one direction and
then in the other in a battern that is known, in its simplest form,
as boom and bust. '
First, we must startowith some definitions. When stock prices
reinforce the underlyihg trend, we shall call the trend self-rein-
forcing; when they work in the opposite direction, self-correcting.
The same terminology holds for the prevailing bias: it can be self-
reinforcing or self-correcting. It is important to realize what these
terms mean. When a trend is reinforced, it accelerates. Yhsn the
bias is reinforced, the divergence between expectations and the
actual course of future stock prices gets wider and, conversely,
when it is self-correcting, the divergence gets narrower. As far as
stock prices are concerned, we shall describe them simply as ris-
ing and falling. When the prevailing bias helps to raise prices we
shall call it positive; ,when it works in the opposite direction,
negative. Thus rising prices are reinforced by a positive bias and
falling prices by a negative one. In a boomhust sequence we
would expect to find at least one stretch where rising prices are
reinforced by a positive bias and another where falling prices are
reinforced by a negative bias. There must also be a point where
the underlying trend and the prevailing bias combine to reverse
the trend in stock prices.
“ee
Let us now try to build a rudimentary model of boom and bust.
We start with an underlying trend that is not yet recognized-
although a prevailing bias that is not yet reflected in stock prices
is also conceivable. Thus, the prevziling bias is negstive to start
with. When the market participants recognize -Che trend, this
change in perceptions will affect stock prices. The change in stock
prices may or may not affect the underlying trend. In the latter
case, there is little more to discuss. In the former case we have the
beginning of a self-reinforcing process.
The enhanced trend will affect the prevailing bias in one of two
ways: it will lead to the expectation of further acceleration or to
the expectation of a correction. In the latter case, the underlying
trend may or may not survive the correction in stock prices. In
the former case, a positive bias develops causing a further rise in
stock prices and a further acceleration in the underlying trend. As
long as the bias is self-reinforcing, expectations rise even faster

52 Theory
than stock prices. The underlying trend becomes increasingly in-
fluenced by stock prices and the rise in stock prices becomes
t
increasingly dependent on the prevailing bias, so that both the
underlying trend and the prevailing bias become increasingly vul-
nerable. Eventually, the trend in prices cannot sustain prevailing
expectations and a correction sets in. Disappointed expectations
have a negative effect on stock prices, and faltering stock prices
weaken the underlying trend. If the underlying trend has become
overly dependent on stock prices, the correction may turn into a
total reversal. In that case, stock prices fall, the underlying trend
is reversed, and expectations fall even further. In this way, a self-
reinforcing process gets started in the opposite dircctior,. EVGE
tually, the downturn also reaches a climax and reverses itself.
Typically, a self-reinforcing process-undergoes orderly correc-
I tions in the early stages, and, if it survives them, the bias tends to
be reinforced, and is less easily shaken. When the process is ad-
vanced, corrections become scarcer and the danger of a climactic
reversal greater.
I have sketched out a typical boomhust sequence. It can be
illustrated by two curves that follow more or less the same direc-
tion. One represents stock prices, and the other, earnings per
share. It would be natural to envision the earnings curve as a
measure of the underlying trend, and the divergence between the
two curves as an indication of the underlying bias. The relation-
ship is much more complex. The earnings curve incorporates not
only the underlying trend but also the influence of stock prices
on that trend; the prevailing bias is expressed only partially by
the divergence between the two curves-partially it is already
reflected in those curves. Concepts that are only partially observ-
able are extremely difficult to work with; that is why we have
chosen variables that can be observed and quantified-although,
as we shall see later, the quantification of earnings per share can
be very misleading. For present purposes, we shall assume that
the "fundamentals" in which investors are interested are properly
measured by earnings per share.
A typical path for the two curves may be as follows. (See the
figure below.) At first, recognition of an underlying trend is lag-
ging but the trend is strong enough to manifest itself in earnings
per share (AB). When the underlying trend is finally recognized,
it is reinforced by rising expectations (BC). Doubts arise, but the
trend survives. Alternatively, the trend waivers but reasserts it-

self. Such testing may be repeated several times, but here I show
it only once (CD). ~ventuallc~o,n viction develops and it is no
longer shaken by a setback in the earning trend (DE). Expectations
become excessive, and fail to be sustained by reality (EF). The
bias is recognized as such and expectations are lowered (FG).
Stock prices lose their, last prop and plunge (G). The underlying
trend is reversed, reinforcing the decline (GH). Eventually, the
pessimism becomes overdone and the market stabilizes (HI).
It should be emphasized that this is only one po&ble path that
results from the interplay of a single underlying trend and a pre-
vailing bias. There could be more than one trend at work and the
prevailing bias could have many nuances, so that the sequence of
events might require a totally different representation.
A few words about the theoretical construction of the model
may be in order. We are interested in the interplay between the
participants' bias and the actual course of events. Yet the partici-
pants' bias is not directly represented in our model; both curves
denote the actual course of events. The prevailing bias is partially
incorporated in the two curves and partially denoted by the di-
vergence between them.
The great merit of this construction is that it uses variables that
can be quantified. Stock prices serve as a convenient proxy for the
situation to which the participants' bias relates. In other historical
processes the situation that is interconnected with the partici-

==================================================

54 Theory
pants' perception by the cognitive and participating functions is
more difficult to identify and impossible to quantify. It is the
t
availability of a convenient proxy that renders the stock market
such a useful laboratory for studying reflexivity.
Unfortunately, the model offers only a partial explanation of
how stock prices are determined. The concept of an underlying
trend has been introduced as a placeholder term, to denote
changes in the "fundamentals." What the fundamentals are has
not been defined. Even the question of how the fundamentals are
to be measured has not been answered. Earnings, dividends, asset
value, free cash flow: all these yardsticks are relevant, as well as
many others, but the relative weight given to each depends on the
investors' jadgments and is therefore subject to their bias. We may
use earnings per share for purposes of illustration, but that merely
4 begs the question. It is a question security analysts have been
struggling with for a long time. We do not need to answer it here
in order to develop a theory of reflexivity.
Without knowing afiything about the fundamentals we can
make some worthwhile generalizations. The first generalization is
that stock prices must have some effect on the fundamentals
(whatever they are), in order to create a boomhust pattern. Some-
times the connection is direct, as in the examples I shall use in
this chapter, but generally it is indirect. Often it makes its effect
felt through a political process, such as changes in taxation, or
regulation, or attitudes to saving and investment.
It is possible to have a reflexive connection between stock
prices and the prevailing bias even if the fundamentals remain
unaffected, but the connection becomes interesting only if the
fundamentals are also involved. Without a change in fundamen-
tals, the prevailing bias is likely to be corrected in short order, as
we can observe in the daily fluctuations of stock prices. It would
be quite in order to ignore the bias as mere noise. That is what the
theory of perfect competition and the fundamentalist approach to
security analysis have done. By contrast, when the fundamentals
are affected, the bias cannot be left out of account without se-
rious distortion, because the bias gives rise to a self-reinforcing/
self-defeating process that leaves neither stock prices, nor the
fundamentals, nor the participants' views the same as they were
before.
The second generalization is that there is bound to be a flaw in
the participants' perception of the fundamentals. The flaw may

not be apparent in the early stages but it is likely to manifest itself
later on. When it does, it sets the stage for a reversal in the pre-
vailing bias. If the change in bias reverses the underlying trend a
self-reinforcing process is set in motion in the opposite direction.
What the flaw is and how and when it is likely to manifest itself
are the keys to understanding boomhust sequences.
The model I presented above is built on these two generaliza-
tions. It hardly needs emphasizing how crude the mode1 is.
Nevertheless, it is valuable in identifying the crucial features of a
typical boombust sequence. These are the unrecognized trend;
the beginning of a self-reinforcing process; the successful test; the
growing conviction, resulting in a widening divergence between
reality and expectations; the flaw in perceptions; the climax; a
self-reinforcing process in the opposite direction. Just by identi-
fying these features we can gain some insight into the behavior of
stock prices. We cannot expect much more from our rudimentary
model.
In any case, a reflexive model cannot take the place of funda-
mental analysis: all it can do is to provide an ingredient that is
missing from it. In principle, the two approaches could be recon-
ciled. Fundamental analysis seeks to establish how underlying
values are reflected in stock prices, whereas the theory of re-
flexivity shows how stock prices can influence underlying
values. One provides a static picture, the other a dynamic
one.
A theory that offers a partial explanation of st@% price move-
ments can be very useful to the investor especially if it illumi-
nates a relationship that other investors fail to grasp. Investors
operate with limited funds and limited intelligence: they do not
need to know everything. As long as they understand something
better than others, they have an edge. The trouble with any kind
of specialized knowledge is that one's area of expertise may not
be especially interesting, but the theory of reflexivity serves to
identify historically significant price movements, so it goes right
to the heart of the matter.
The rudimentary model I have outlined above has proved
extremely rewarding in my career as an investor. That may
seem surprising because the model is so simple and it fits a well-
trodden stock market pattern so well that one would expect every
investor to be familiar with it. Yet, that is not the case. Why? Part
of the answer must be that market participants have been mis-

guided by a different theoretical construction, one derived from
classical economics and, even more important, from the natural
4
sciences. The ingrained attitude is that stock prices are the pas-
sive reflection of some underlying reality and not an active ingre-
dient in the historical process. This view is simply false. It is
remarkable that the error has still not been fully recognized.
Nevertheless, investors do recognize the sequence I have de-
scribed and do respond to it, only they respond later than some-
one who is working with the appropriate model and is on the
lookout for the crucial features that define the shape of the price
curve. That is what has given me my edge.
The first time I used the model systematically was in the cm-
glomerate boom oi the late 1960s. It enabled me to make money
both on the way up and on the way down.
I The key to the conglomerate boom was a pre~ailingm isconcep-
tion among investors. Investors had come to value growth in
per-share earnings and failed to discriminate about the way the
earnings growth was accomplished. A few companies learned to
produce earnings growth through acquisitions. Once the market
started to reward them for their performance, their task became
easier because they could offer their own highly priced stock in
acquiring other companies.
In theory, the process works as follows. Let us assume that all
of the companies involved have the same intrinsic growth in earn-
ings but the stock of the acquiring company sells at twice the
earnings multiple of the acquired ones; if the acquiring company
manages to double its size, its earnings per share jump by 50%,
and its growth rate increases accordingly.
In practice, the early conglnmerates started out with high in-
trinsic growth rates that were rewarded by high multiples. Several
of the pathbreakers were high-technology companies with a
strong defense component whose managements recognized that
their historic growth rate could not be sustained indefinitely: Tex-
tron, Teledyne, Ling-Temco-Vought (later LTV), to mention a few.
They started to acquire more mundane companies, but, as their
per-share earnings growth accelerated, the multiples expanded
instead of contracting. Their success attracted imitators and later
on even the most humdrum companies could attain a high multi-
ple by going on an acquisition spree. For instance, the bulk of
Ogden's earnings was derived from trading scrap metal; neverthe-
less, the stock sold at more than twenty times earnings at its peak.

Eventually, a company could achieve a high multiple just by
promising to put it to good use by making acquisitions.
Managements developed special accounting techniques that en-
hanced the impact of acquisitions. They also introduced changes
in the acquired compahies, streamlining operations, disposing of
assets, and generally; focusing on the bottom line, but these
changes were less sigriificant than the impact on per-share earn-
ings of the acquisitions themselves.
Investors responded like Indians to firewater. At first, the rec-
ord of each company was judged on its own merit, but gradually
conglomerates became recognized as a group. A new breed of
investors emerged, thp so-called go-go fund managers, or gun-
slingers, who developed a special affinity with the managements
of conglomerates. Direct lines of communication were opened
between them and conglomerates would place so-called "letter
stock" directly with investors. Eventually, conglomerates learned
to manage their stock prices as well as their earnings.
Events followed th4 sequence described in my model. Multi-
ples expanded and eventually reality could not sustain expecta-
tions. More and more people realized the misconception on
which the boom rested even as they continued to play the game.
Acquisitions had to get larger and larger in order to maintain the
momentum, and in the end they ran into the limits of size. The
climactic event was the attempt by Saul Steinberg to acquire
Chemical Bank: it was fought and defeated by the establishment.
When stock prices started to fall, the decline fedon itself. The
favorable impact of acquisitions on per-share earnings dimin-
ished and eventually it became impractical to make new acquisi-
tions. The internal problems that had been swept under the carpet
during the period of rapid external growth began to surface. Earn-
ings reports revealed unpleasant surprises. Investors became dis-
illusioned and managements went through their own crises: after
the heady days of success, few were willing to buckle down to
the burdens of day-to-day management. The situation was aggra-
vated by recession, and many of the high-flying conglomerates
literally disintegrated. Investors were prepared to believe the
worst and in some cases the worst actually occurred. In others,
reality turned out to be better than expectations and eventually
the situation stabilized with the surviving companies, often under
new management, slowly working themselves out from under the
debris.

The conglomerate boom is particularly well suited to serve as

reported per-share earnings. However meaningless the figures,

My best documented encounter with a boom/bust sequence is
that of Real Estate Investment Trusts. REITs, as they are called,
are a special corporate form brought into existence by legislation.
Their key feature is that they can distribute their income free of
corporate taxation, provided they distribute all the income they
receive. The opportunity created by this legislation remained
largely unexploited until 1969 when a large number of REITs
were founded. I was present at the creation and, fresh from my
experience with conglomerates, recognized their boom/bust po-
tential. I published a research report whose key part reads as

THE CASF~O R MORTGAGE TRUSTS
(February 1970)
THE CONCEPT
Superficially, mortgage trusts seem to resemble mutual funds
designed to provide hi~hcu rrent yields. But the analogy is mis-
leading. The true attraction of mortgage trusts lies in their ability
to generate capital gains for their shareholdersb y selling additional
shares at a premium over book value. If a trust with a book value
of $10 and a 12% return on equity doubles its equity by selling
additional shares at $20, the book value jumps to $13.33 and per-
share earnings go from $1.20 to $1.60.
Investors are willing to pay a premium because of the high yield
and the expectation of per-share earnings growth. The higher the
premium, the easier it is for the trust to fulfill this expectation. The
process is a self-reinforcing one. Once it gets under way, the trust
can show a steady growth in per-share earnings despite the fact
that it distributes practjcally all its earnings as dividends. Investors
who participate in the process early enough can enjoy the com-
pound benefits of a high return on equity, a rising book value, and
a rising premium over book value.
ANALYTICAL APPROACH
The conventional method of security analysis is to try and pre-
dict the future course of earnings and then to estimate the price
that investors may be willing to pay for those earnings. This
method is inappropriate to the analysis of mortgage trusts because
the price that investors are willing to pay for the shares is an im-
portmt factor in determining the future course of earnings.
Instead of predicting future earnings and valuations separately,
we shall try to predict the future course of the entire self-
reinforcing process. We shall identify three major factors which
reinforce each other and we shall sketch out a scenario of the
probable course of development. The three factors are:
1. The effective rate of return on the mortgage trust's capital
2. The rate of growth of the mortgage trust's size
3. Investor recognition, i.e., the multiple investors are willing
to pay for a given rate of growth in per-share earnings

THE SCENARIO
Act One: At present, the effectivey ield on construction loans is at
an optimum. Not only are interest rates high but losses are at a
relatively low level. There is a pent-up demand for housing and
new houses readily find buyers. There is a shortage of funds so that
the projects which do get off the ground are economically well
justified. Builders who are still in business are more substantial
and more reliable than at the tail end of a boom. Moreover, they do
their utmost to complete the construction phase as fast as possible
because money is so expensive. Shortages of labor and material do
cause defaults and delays but rising costs permit mortgage trusts to
liquidate their commitments without loss.
Money is tight and alternative sources of interim financing are
in short supply. Investor recognition of the mortgage trust concept
has progressed far enough to permit the formation of new trusts
and the rapid expansion of existing ones. The self-reinforcing pro-
cess gets under way.
Act Two: If and when inflation abates, the effective yield on con-
struction loans will decline. On the other hand, there will be a
housing boom and bank credit will be available at advantageous
rates. With higher leverage, the rate of return on equity can be
maintained despite a lower effectivey ield. With a growing market
and growing investor recognition, the premium over book value
may continue to increase. Mortgage trusts are likely to take full
advantage of the premium and show a rapid rise in both size and
per-share earnings. Since entry into the field is unrestricted, the
number of mortgage trusts will also increase.
Act Three: The self-reinforcing process will continue until mort-
gage trusts have captured a significant part of %he construction loan
market. Increasing competition will then force them to take greater
risks. Construction activity itself will have become more specula-
tive and bad loans will increase. Eventually, the housing boom will
slacken off and housing surpluses will appear in various parts of
the country, accompanied by a slack real estate market and tem-
porary declines in real estate prices. At this point, some of the
mortgage trusts will be bound to have a large number of delinquent
loans in their portfolios and the banks will panic and demand that
their lines of credit be paid off.
Act Four: Investor disappointment will affect the valuation of the
group, and a lower premium coupled with slower growth will in

turn reduce the per-share earnings progression. The multiple will
decline and the group will go through a shakeout period. After the
shakeout, the industry will have attained maturity: there will be
few new entries, regulations may be introduced, and existing trusts
will settle down to a more moderate growth.
,
I
EVALUATION I
The shakeout is a ldng time away. Before it occurs, mortgage
trusts will have grown manifold in size and mortgage trust shares
will have shown tremendous gains. It is not a danger that should
deter investors at the p~esentti me.
The only real danger at present is that the self-reinforcing pro-
cess may not get under way at all. In a really serious stock mamet
decline investors may be unwilling to pay any premium even for a
12% return on equity. We doubt that such conditions would arise;
we are more inclined to expect an environment in which a 12%
return is more exceptional than it has been recently and in which
the self-reinforcing processes of the last few years, notably con-
glomerates and computer leasing companies, are going through
their shakeout period. In such an environment there should be
enough money available for a self-reinforcing process which is just
starting, especially if it is the only game in town.
'"If the process fails to get under way, investors would find down-
side protection in the book value. The new trusts are coming to the
market at book value plus underwriting commission (usually 10%).
Most recently formed trusts are selling at a premium which is still
modest. It will be recalled that when their assets 3fe fully em-
ployed in interim loans, mortgage trusts can earn 11% on their
book without leverage and 12% with a 1:l leverage. A modest
premium over book value would seem justified even in the absence
of growth.
If the self-reinforcing process does get under way, shareholders
in well-managed mortgage trusts should enjoy the compound ben-
efits of a high return on equity, a rising book value, and a rising
premium over book value for the next few years. The capital gains
potential is of the same order of magnitude as at the beginning of
other self-reinforcing processes in recent stock market history.
My report had an interesting history. It came at a time when go-
go fund managers had suffered severe losses in the collapse of the
conglomerates. Since they were entitled to share in the profits but
did not have to share in the losses of the funds they managed,

they were inclined to grasp at anything that held out the pros-
pect of a quick profit. They instinctively understood how a self-
I
reinforcing process works since they had just participated in one
and they were anxious to play. The report found a tremendous
response whose extent I realized only when I received a telephone
call from a bank in Cleveland asking for a new copy because theirs
had gone through so many Xerox incarnations that it was no
longer legible. There were only a few mortgage trusts in existence
at the time but the shares were so eagerly sought after that they
nearly doubled in price in the space of a month or so. Demand
generated supply and there was a flood of new issues coming to
market. When it became clear that the stream of new mortgage
trusts was inexhaustible, prices fell almost as rapidly as they had
gone up. Obviously the readers of the report failed to take into
4 account the ease of entry and their mistake was corrected in short
order. Nevertheless their enthusiastic reception helped to get the
self-reinforcing process described in the report under way. Sub-
sequent events took the course outlined in the report. Mortgage
trust shares enjoyed a boom that was not as violent as the one that
followed the publication of the report but turned out to be more
enduring.
I had invested heavily in mortgage trusts and took some profits
when the reception of my study exceeded my expectations. But I
was sufficiently carried away by my own success to be caught in
the downdraft with a significant inventory. I hung on and even
increased my positions. I followed the industry closely for a year
or so and sold my holdings with good profits. Then I lost touch
with the group until a few years later when problems began to
surface. I was tempted to establish a short pcsitioo but was hand-
icapped in that I was no longer famiiiar with the terrain. Never-
theless, when I reread the report I had written several years
earlier, I was persuaded by my own prediction. I decided to sell
the group short more or less indiscriminately. Moreover, as the
shares fell I maintained the same level of exposure by selling
additional shares short. My original prediction was fulfilled and
most REITs went broke. The result was that 1 reaped more than
100% profit on my short positions-a seeming impossibility since
the maximum profit on a short position is 100%. (The explanation
is that I kept on selling additional shares.)
Self-reinforcinghelf-defeating cycles like the conglomerate
boom and the REITs do not occur every day. There are long fallow

periods when the specialist in such cycles remains unemployed.
He need not starve, however. The divergence between underlying
trends and investor recognition persists at all times and the astute
investor can take advantage of it. New industries arise, or old ones
come back into favor. 'Typically, they are inadequately followed
at first. For instance, when defense spending started to rise in the
early 1970s after a long decline, there were only two or three
analysts left who follbwed the industry, although it still repre-
sented a substantial portion of the economy. Those who were left
were too demoralized to recognize the beginning of a major new
trend. That was a wqnderful time to invest in defense stocks.
There were high-tech fiefense stocks that had never been visited
by an analyst, like E-Systems, Inc., and well-established compa-
nies that had fallen on evil days trying to diversify out of defense,
like Sanders Associates, or getting caught up in scandals trying to
sell airplanes through bribery, like Northrop and Lockheed.
In the case of defense stocks, there was no self-reinforcing pro-
cess involved but investor recognition certainly helped the price
of the stocks. Actually, it is a rare case where the investors' bias
leaves the fundamentals totally unaffected. Even with defense
stocks the prevailing bias played a role, but it was a negative one.
Lockheed had to be bailed out by the government and companies
like Sanders Associates had to restructure.their debt by offering
conver$ble bonds at prices that turned out to be very low in
retrospect. Only when the negative bias was corrsted was there
very little further feedback: companies had little need for addi-
tional capital, and managements, having been burned once before,
were leery of diversifying out of defense. There were exceptions,
like United Aircraft, but investnrs' bias never turned positive
enough to allow a self-reinforcing process to get under way: many
of United Aircraft's acquisitions were for cash and those that in-
volved stock did not enhance earnings significantly. The result
was a larger, diversified company, but no boom and bust in the
stock.
Perhaps the most interesting case of negative bias occurred in
technology stocks. After the stock market debacle of 1974, inves-
tors were leery of any company that needed to raise equity capital
from outside sources. Distributed data processing was in the early
stages of its development. New companies like Datapoint and
Four-Phase were in the vanguard with IBM lagging badly. The
market was practically exploding but these little companies were

hamstrung by their inability to raise capital. The stocks were sell-
,
ing at very low multiples of anticipated earnings and the main
argument against them was that they would not be able to grow
fast enough to meet the demand and eventually IBM would move
into the market. The argument turned out to be valid, but not
before these companies became large and prosperous and inves-
tors became eager to throw money at them at high multiples.
Those who had been willing to fight the negative bias were amply
rewarded.
As the various niches occupied by these small companies con-
verged to form a large market, most of them were absorbed by
larger companies and thase that stayed independent fel1 on evil
days. Datapoint is currently looking for a home at a much reduced
multiple. Four-Phase was recently acquired by Motorola, which
4 proceeded to lose its shirt on it. If the initial market reaction to
distributed data-processing companies had been more positive, it
is possible that some of the early starters might have grown fast
enough to survive, just as the earlier wave of microcomputer man-
ufacturers did spawn a few enduring companies like Digital
Equipment and Data General.
The negative bias of the 1975-1976 period gave way to the
opposite extreme. It found expression in a venture capital boom
that culminated in the second quarter of 1983. The sequence of
events is not as clear cut as in the case of REITs, but that is only
because high technology is not as homogeneous an industry. The
same reflexive interaction between stock prices, prevailing bias,
and fundamentals can be observed but much more specific
knowledge is required to trace the course of events.
The availability of venture capital on altiticti.~et erms led to a
proliferation of new ventures. Every new company needed equip-
ment, as well as inventory, so that electronic equipment manufac-
turers enjoyed a boom, and so did the manufacturers of products
and components. The electronics industry is a large customer of
its own products so that the boom was self-reinforcing. But the
proliferation of companies intensified competition. Industry lead-
ers lost their market position as a new generation of products was
introduced because the individuals who were responsible for de-
veloping them left their companies and set up new ones. Instead
of companies growing in step with their industry, the industry
grew by the multiplication of companies. Investors failed to rec-
ognize this trend; as a result, technology stocks in general and
new issues in particular became substantially overvalued.

The new issue boom culminated in the second quarter of 1983.
When prices started to decline, fewer issues could be sold and
eventually venture capitalists became less venturesome. As fewer
companies were formed and the existing ones depleted their cash,
the market for technqlogy products softened. Competition inten-
sified and profit margins deteriorated. The process started to feed
on itself and the low point has probably still not been reached.*
The venture capital boom was not the only cause of the subse-
quent shakeout-the strong dollar and the rise of Japanese com-
petition were at least as important-but it is clear that stock
prices had an impact bn the "fundamentals" in both directions.
What distinguishes' the conglomeldie and mXT sequznces from
the venture capital boom is that in the first two cases the under-
lying trend itself was based on the exploitation of the investors'
bias while in the third it was not. In the case of conglomerates the
idea was to acquire other companies with inflated paper; in the
case of REITs the idea was equity leveraging. The idea behind the
latest generation of technology products had nothing to do with
the stock market.
To understand the ups and downs of technology stocks we
must know something about the underlying trends in technology;
in the case of conglomerates and mITs we need to know little
else than the theory of reflexivity.
It is important to realize, however, that knowing everything
about underlying trends in technology is not sufikient to explain
the ups and downs of technology stocks: the reflexive interaction
between underlying trends, prevailing biases, and stock prices
also needs to be understood. Combining the two kinds of under-
standifig is extremely difficult. Those who want to be familis
with technology must follow the industry closely and continu-
ously; those who want to exploit the divergence between percep-
tion and reality must move from group to group. Most technology
experts are ignorant of reflexivity and tend to remain fully in-
vested at all times. Their popularity and influence wax and wane
in a reflexive fashion. After the recent decline in technology
stocks, a new breed of analysts seems to be emerging who are
overly sensitive to the importance of investors' perceptions. After
a decent interval it may be once again profitable to go against the
prevailing bias and invest in technology stocks on the basis of
fundamental trends.

I have always had a lot of difficulty investing in technology
4 stocks because of the specialized knowledge required. Finally, I
managed to gain a good insight into the computer industry during
the 1975-1976 period and profited from the prevailing negative
bias. I held on to my positions for a few years but then I sold them
and lost my grip on the industry. In 1981 I made the mistake of
not participating in a venture capital fund operated by one of the
most successful venture capitalists of the period in the belief that
the boom could not last long enough to allow investors to exit in
time. In this, I was undoubtedly influenced by misgivings about
the larger picture. In any event, his investors realized a good profit
in 1963. By that time I was totally out of touch with technology
stocks and the boom passed me by.
Even the conglomerate and REIT sequences were not totally
t
self-contained. Extraneous developments, such as the level of
economic activity, regulation, or sGcific events (e.g., the at-
tempted takeover of Chemical Bank), played a crucial role in the
conglomerate boom. In less "pure" sequences the importance of
outside influences is even peafer.
We are currently in the midst of another self-reinforcinglself-
defeating cycle that will go down in history as the mergermania
of the 1980s. Instead of inflated paper, it is cash that serves as the
currency. The scale of transactions already dwarfs the conglom-
erate boom. Mergermania is but an element in a much larger on-
going historical drama whose ramifications reach far beyond the
stock market and involve politics, exchange rates, monetary and
fiscal policies, quirks of taxation, international capital move-
ments, and many other developments.
I shali m~kean attempt at unraveling the ongoing historical
drama, but that is not as simple as analyzing a more or less self-
contained boombust sequence. The larger picture is full of reflex-
ive interactions as well as nonreflexive fundamental trends. We
need a more complex model that allows for the transition from
one boombust sequence to another and for the coexistence of
several reflexive processes at the same time.
Before I embark on such an ambitious project, I want to exam-
ine another market that is characterized by vicious and benign
circles: the currency market.

REFLEXNITY IN THE CURRENCY
MARKET*
I
While reflexive interactions are intermittent in the stock market,
they are continuous in the market for currencies. I shall try to
show that freely floating exchange rates are inherently unstable;
moreover, the instability is cumulative so that the eventual break-
down of a freely floqting exchange rate system is virtually as-
sured.
The traditional view of the currency market is that it tends
toward equilibrium. An overvalued exchange rat&courages im-
ports and discourages exports until equilibrium is reestablished.
Similarly, an improvement in competitive position is reflected in
an appreciating exchange rate that reduces the trade surplus so
that equilibrium is again reestablished. Speculation cannot dis-
rupt the trend toward equilibrium-if speculators anticipate the
future correctly, they accelerate the trend; if they misjudge it, they
will be penalized by the underlying trend that may be delayed
but will inexorably assert itself.
Experience since floating exchange rates were introduced in
1973 has disproved this view. Instead of fundamentals determin-
ing exchange rates, exchange rates have found a way of influenc-
ing the fundamentals. For instance, a strong exchange rate
discourages inflation: wages remain stable and the price of im-
ports falls. When exports have a large import component, a coun-
try can remain competitive almost indefinitely in spite of a steady

appreciation of its currency, as Germany demonstrated in the
I 1970s.
The fact is that the relationship between the domestic inflation
rate and the international exchange rate is not unidirectional but
circular. Changes in one may precede changes in the other, but it
does not make sense to describe one as the cause and the other as
the effect because they mutually reinforce each other. It is more
appropriate to speak of a vicious circle in which the currency
depreciates and inflation accelerates or of a benign circle where
the opposite happens.
Vicious and benign circles are a far cry from equilibrium.
NeverthePsss, they could produce a state of affairs akin to equi-
librium if the reflexive, mutually self-reinforcing relationship
could be sustained indefinitely. But that is not the case. The
t
self-reinforcing process tends to become more vulnerable the
longer it lasts and eventually it is bound to reverse itself, setting
in motion a self-reinforcing process in the opposite direction.
A complete cycle is characterized by wide fluctuations not
only in the exchange rate but also in interest rates, inflation,
andlor the level of economic activity.
The participants' bias introduces an element of instability into
the system. If the system had an innate tendency toward equilib-
rium the participants' bias could not disrupt it; at worst, it could
introduce some random, short-term fluctuations. But when the
causal connections are reflexive, the participants' bias may engen-
der, sustain, or destroy a vicious or benign circle. Moreover, the
prevailing bias takes on a life of its own as one of the constituent
parts in a circular relationship. It finds expression in spec~lative
capital movements that may serve as a counterweight to an imbal-
ance in trade, allowing a trade surplus or deficit to exceed, both
in size and in duration, the level that could have been sustained
in its absence. When that happens speculation becomes a desta-
bilizing influence.
International capital movements tend to follow a self-reinforc-
inglself-defeating pattern similar to the one we identified in the
stock market. But the model we used for stock price movements
cannot be applied to currency markets without substantial modi-
fications. In the stock market we focused on the reflexive relation-
ship between two variables: stock prices and a single underlying
trend. We were trying to build the simplest possible model and
we were willing to simplify a much more complex reality to serve

our purpose. In the currency market we cannot get by with two
variables; even the simplest model will need seven or eight. We
have selected four rates and four quantities, namely:
4
nominal exchange iate (number of foreign currency units for one
t
domestic currency unit; e = strengthening)
nominal interest rake
domestic versus foreign price level ( p = increase in domestic
prices faster than in foreign prices and vice versa)
level of economic activity
nonspeculative capital. fl~w
speculative capital flow = increased inflow
t
trade balance = surplus
5.
government budget = deficit
Our task is to establtsh how these variables relate to each other.
We shall not attempt to explore all the relationships but only
those that are necessary to build simple models. In other words,
we are not aiming at a general theory, only at a partial explanation
of currency movements. Our focus is the exchange rate and we
bring in the other variables only when we need them. We shall
not quantify any of the variables but only indicate direction
5.
( , ) or order of magnitude (>, <). A
Before we start, two general observations can be made. One is
that relationships tend to be circular; that is, variables can serve
as both cause and effect in relation to other variables. We shall
denote the causal connection by 2 horizcntal =ow (+j. The other
point is that the relationship of .the variables need not be inter-
nally conastent; it is the inconsistencies that make that entire
situation move in a certain direction, creating vicious or benign
circles. Equilibrium would require internal consistency; histori-
cal change does not. Describing historical change in terms of vi-
cious and benign circles is, of course, merely a figure of speech.
A circular movement between component parts when the entire
system is in motion could also be described as a spiral. Moreover,
what is benign and what is vicious are in the eye of the beholder.
Exchange rates are determined by the demand and supply of
currencies. For present purposes, we can group the various factors
that constitute demand and supply under three headings: trade,
nonspeculative capital transactions, and speculative capital

transactions. This gives us the simplest model of a freely floating
4 exchange rate system:
In other words, the sum of the currency transactions under the
three headings determines the direction of the exchange rate.
Our primary interest is in investigating the role that the partic-
ipants' bias plays in exchange rate movements. To facilitate the
investigation, we shall assume that the bias finds expression only
in speculative capital transactions (S],w hile LiSe (?f and non-
speculative capital flows (N) are independent of expectations:
they constitute the "fundamentals." In reality, the "fundamen-
4
tals" are also influenced by the participants' expectations about
the future course of 'exchange rates. Trade figures are notoriously
distorted by leads and lags in payment, not to mention the effect
of expectations on the inventory policy of exporters and import-
ers. As far as capital movements are concerned, perhaps the only
transaction that is totally independent of expectations is the pay-
ment of interest on accumulated debt; the reinvestment of interest
receipts already qualifies as a speculative transaction. The repa-
triation of bank debt from less developed countries is probably
best described as nonspeculative, although speculative consider-
ations come into play if and when the assets are redeployed. What
about direct investment? If managements were interested only in
the total rate of return, it ought to be classified as speculative, but
often there are overriding industrial considerations. It can be seen
that there are many gradations betwee3 speculative and nonspe-
culative transactions; but we do not do any great violence to real-
ity by putting them into these two broad categories.
We shall focus on speculative capital transactions because that
is where the participants' bias finds expression. Speculative cap-
ital moves in search of the highest total return. Total return has
three elements: the interest rate differential, the exchange rate
differential, and the capital appreciation in local currency. Since
the third element varies from case to case we can propose the
following general rule: speculative capital is attracted by rising
exchange rates and rising interest rates.

==================================================

Reflexivity in the Currency Market 73
Of the two, exchange rates are by far the more important. It does
not take much of a decline in the currency to render the total
return negative. By the same. token, when an appreciating cur-
rency also offers an interest rate advantage, the total return ex-
ceeds anything that alholder of financial assets could expect in
the normal course of events.
That is not to say tbat interest rate differentials are unimpor-
tant; but much of their importance lies in their effect on exchange
rates and that depends on the participants' perceptions. There are
times when relative interest rates seem to be a major influence; at
other times they are totally disregarded. For instance, from 1982
to 1986 capital was artacted to the currency with the 2.-,i&est
interest rate, namely, the dollar, but in the late 1970s Switzerland
could not arrest the influx of capital even by imposing negative
interest rates. Moreover, perceptions about the importance of in-
terest rates are often bong. For instance, until November 1984
the strength of the dollar was widely attributed to high interest
rates in the United States. When interest rates declined without
the dollar weakening this view was discredited and the dollar
went through the roof.
Expectations about' exchange rates play the same role in cur-
rency markets as expectations about stock prices do in the stock
market: they constitute the paramount consideration for those
who are motivated by the total rate of return. In the stock market
that covers practically all investors, in currency markets all spec-
ulative transactions.
In the stock market we used a model that focused on stock
prices and disregarded dividend income. No great distortion was
involved because in the kind of boom/"busf sequences we were
considering stock price movements far outweigh dividend in-
come. Similar conditions prevail in currency markets: expecta-
tions about future exchange rates constitute the main motivation
in speculative capital transactions. .
The major difference between the stock market and the cur-
rency market seems to be the role played by the fundamentals.
We have seen that the "fundamentals" were rather nebulous even
,
in the case of stocks but at least we had no reason to doubt that
stock prices were somehow connected to the fundamentals. In the
case of currencies the trade balance is clearly the most important
fundamental factor, yet the dollar strengthened between 1982 and
1985 while the trade balance of the United States was deteriorat-

74 Theory
ing. It would seem that the fundamentals are even less relevant in
4 determining price trends than in the stock market. We do not
need to look far afield for an explanation: it is to be found in the
relative importance of speculative capital movements.
As we have seen, speculative capital is motivated primarily by
expectations about future exchange rates. To the extent that ex-
change rates are dominated by speculative capital transfers, they
are purely reflexive: expectations relate to expectations and the
prevailing bias can validate itself almost indefinitely. The situa-
tion is highly unstable: if the opposite bias prevailed, it could also
validate itself. The greater the relative importance of speculation,
+$hem ore unstable the system becomes: the total rate of return can
flip-flop with every change in the prevailing bias.
In our discussion of the stock market we identified certain se-
t
quences such as the conglomerate boom where the prevailing bias
formed an important part of the underlying trend, but we con-
cluded that such pure m p l e s o f reflexivity are exceptional. By
contrast, in a system of freely fluctuating exchange rates reflexiv-
ity constitutes the rule. Of course, there is no such thing as a
purely reflexive situation. Speculation is only one of the factors
that determine exchange rates and the other factors must also be
taken into account in formulating one's expectations. Thus, ex-
pectations cannot be totally capricious: they must be rooted in
something other than themselves. How a prevailing bias becomes
established and, even more important, how it is reversed are the
most important questions confronting us.
There are no universally valid answers. Reflexive processes
tend to follow a certain pattern. In the early stages, the trend has
.to be self-reinforcing, otherwise the process aborts. As the trend
extends, it becomes increasingly vulnerable because the funda-
mentals such as trade and interest payments move against the
trend, in accordance with the precepts of classical analysis, and
the trend becomes increasingly dependent on the prevailing bias.
Eventually a turning point is reached and, in a full-fledged se-
quence, a self-reinforcingp rocess starts operating in the opposite
direction.
Within this general pattern each sequence is unique. It is the
characteristic feature of a reflexive process that neither the partic-
ipants' perceptions nor the situation to which they relate remain
unaffected by it. It follows that no sequence can repeat itself. Not
even the variables that interact in a circular fashion need be the

same; certainly they will not carry the same weight on different
occasions.
We have had two major reflexive moves in the dollar since the
breakdown of the Bretton Woods system and at least that many in
sterling. It it instructive to compare the two big moves in the
dollar because the interaction between the trade balance and cap-
ital movements was rqically different in the two instances.
In the late 1970s the dollar got progressively weaker, especially
against the continental currencies, while in the 1980s it got pro-
gressively stronger. We shall call the first move Carter's vicious
circle and the second Reagan's benign circle. We can build simple
models to show how differeni the two trends were.
In the case of Germany in the late 1970s, the German mark was
strong ( f e). Speculative purchases played a major role in making
it stronger ( J. S) and sustaining the benign circle. Germany started
with a trade surplus and the strength of the currency helped to
keep the price level down. Since exports had a large import con-
tent the real exchangq rate, as opposed to the nominal, remained
more or less stable (fep) and the effect on the trade balance was
negligible (IT). With +e speculative inflow predominating ( J. S >
fT), the benign circle was self-reinforcing:
The fact that the rate of currency appreciation exmded the inter-
est rate differential made it very profitable to hold German marks,
so that the speculative inflow was both self-reinforcing and self-
validating.
'What was a benign circle for Germany was a vicious circie for
the United States. As the exchange rate depreciated, inflation ac-
celerated. Despite rising nominal interest rates, real rates re-
mained very low, if not negative. Various measures were tried to
compensate for the outflow of capital, of which the issue of so-
called Carter bonds denominated in German marks and Swiss
francs was the most dramatic, but nothing seemed to work until
the Federal Reserve embraced a strict monetarist policy. Then
came the election of Ronald Reagan to the presidency and the
dollar embarked on a sustained rise.
During Reagan's benign circle the strong dollar caused a sharp
deterioration in the trade balance of the United States. In contrast
to Germany in the late 1970s, the United States did not have a



==================================================
                     PAGE 81                      
==================================================

trade surplus to start with. Moreover, the appreciation in the cur-
I rency was not matched by inflation rate differentials. The infla-
tion rate declined in the United States but it remained low in
other countries as well. As a consequence, the United States de-
veloped an unprecedented trade deficit as well as an unprece-
dented interest rate differential in favor of the dollar. It was
extremely attractive to hold dollars as long as the dollar remained
firm, and the dollar remained firm as long as the deficit on current
account was fully matched by a surplus on capital account. In our
notation:
The models are obviously oversimplified. We shall explore Rea-
gan's benign circle in greater depth later. The point we are trying
to make here is that different sequences have totally different
structures. In the case of Germany in the late 1970s the apprecia-
tion of the currency was sustained by the inflation rate differential
and the balance of trade was largely unaffected. Reagan's benign
circle was sustained by a differential in interest rates rather than
inflation rates and there was an ever-growing trade deficit which
was matched by an ever-growing inflow of capital. While in the
first case it was possible to claim some kind of equilibrium, in the
second case the disequilibrium was palpable. The inflow of capi-
tal depended on a strong dollar and a strong dollar depended on
an ever-rising inflow of capital which carried with it ever-rising
interest and repayment obligations ( T N). It was obvious that the
benign circle could not be sustained indefinitely. Yet, while it
iasted, any cummcy speculator who dared to fight the trend had
to pay dearly for it. Speculation did not serve to reestablish equi-
librium. On the contrary, it reinforced the trend and thereby in-
creased the disequilibriu.m , which would eventually have to be
.
corrected.
Although each self-reinforcing circle is unique, we can make
some universally valid generalizations about freely fluctuating
exchange rates. First, the relative importance of speculative trans-
actions tends to increase during the lifetime of a self-reinforcing
trend. Second, the prevailing bias is a trend-following one and
the longer the trend persists, the stronger the bias becomes. The
third is simply that once a trend is established it tends to persist
and to run its full course; when the turn finally comes, it tends to

==================================================

Reflexivity in the Currency Market 7 7
set into motion a self-reinforcing process in the opposite direc-
tion. In other words, currencies tend to move in large waves, with
each move lasting several years.
These three tendencies are mutually self-validating. It is the
growth in speculative ;capital flows moving in a trend-following
fashion that makes the trend so persistent; it is the persistence of
a
the trend that makes trend-following bias so rewarding; and it
is the rewards reaped by speculation that attract increasing
amounts of capital.
The longer a benign circle lasts, the more attractive it is to hold
financial assets in the appreciating currency and the more impor-
tant the exchange rate'becomes in calculating total return. Those
who are inclined to fight the trend are progressively eliminated
and in the end only trend followers survive as active participants.
As speculation gains in importance, other factors lose their influ-
ence. There is nothing to guide speculators but the market itself,
and the market is dominated by trend followers. These consider-
ations explain how thk dollar could continue to appreciate in the
face of an ever-rising trade deficit. Eventually, a crossover point
would have been reached, even without the intervention of the
authorities, when the inflow of speculative funds could not keep
pace with the trade deficit and with rising interest obligations,
and the trend would have been reversed. Since the predominating
bias is trend following, speculative capital would then have
started moving in the opposite direction. If and %en that hap-
pened, the reversal could easily have accelerated into a free fall.
For one thing, speculation and "fundamental" flows would then
have worked in the same direction. Even more important, when a
change in trend is recognized, the volume of speculative transae-
tions is likely to undergo a dramatic, not to say catastrophic,
increase. While a trend persists, speculative flows are incremen-
tal; but a reversal involves not only the current flow but also the
accumulated stock of speculative capital. The longer the trend
has persisted, the larger the accumulation. There are, of course,
mitigating circumstances. One is that market participants are
likely to recognize a change in trend only gradually. The other is
that the authorities are bound to be aware of the danger and do
something to prevent a crash. How the drama actually unfolded
will be the subject of a later chapter. Here we are trying to estab-
lish a general proposition.
Taking the three generalizations together, it can be asserted that



==================================================
                     PAGE 83                      
==================================================

78 Theory
speculation is progressively destabilizing. The destabilizing effect
I
arises not because the speculative capital flows must be even-
tually reversed but exactly because they need not be reversed
until much later. If they had to be reversed in short order, capital
transactions would provide a welcome cushion for making the
adjustment process less painful. If they need not be reversed, the
participants get to depend on them so that eventually when the
turn comes the adjustment becomes that much more painful.
It is quite likely that the generalization about the progressive
accumulation of hot money holds true not only within a cycle but
also from one cycle to another, although the history of fluctuating
exchange rates is too short to provide reliable evidence. It has
certainly been true so far-the size of speculative capital move-
I ments was far greater in Reagan's benign circle than it was during
Carter's vicious circle. Empirical studies of the 1930s also showed
a cumulative growth in "hot money" movements,' although cir-
cumstances were somewhat different because currencies were not
freely floating.
We can see why hot money should continue to accumulate as
long as real interest rates are high and the return on physical
investments low: keeping capital in liquid fonn in an appreciat;
ing currency is more rewarding than investing it in physical as-
sets. What is needed to give the generalization universal validity
is an argument that would show that fluctuating exchange rates
are associated with high returns on financial assets and low re-
turns on physical investments. Let me try. We have seen that hot
money can earn exceptional returns if it gets the trend right; since
it sets the trend, that is likely to be the case. Physical assets rep-
resent the opposite side of the coin: they cannot move to take
advantage of the trend. The tradable goods sector is bound to
suffer when a currency appreciates. Of course, a depreciating cur-
rency brings windfall profits to exporters, but having been hurt
before, exporters are loath to invest on the basis of a temporary
advantage: they prefer to hold their profits in financial assets,
contributing to the growth of hot money. The process can be most
clearly observed in the United Kingdom, where exporters refused
to expand when sterling fell below $1.10 in 1985, despite record
profits. How right they were! Sterling rose above $1.50 by April
1986. Thus, both an appreciating currency and a depreciating
currency discourage physical investment and foster the accumu-
lation of "hot money."

Reflexivity in the Currency Market 79
We can attempt yet banother tentative generalization. When a
long-term trend loses its momentum, short-term volatility tends
to rise. It is easy to see why that should be so: the trend-following
crowd is disoriented. The generalization is tentative because it is
based on inadequate evidence. It certainly was true when the
dollar reversed its trend in 1985.2
If these generalizations are indeed valid, the eventual demise of
a system of freely fluctuating exchange rates is inevitable. Fluc-
tuations become so wild that either the system has to be modified
by some kind of government intervention or it is bound to break
down. Currency markets thus provide the best support for my
contention that financial markets are inherently unstable. There
is no built-in tendency toward equilibrium: to the extent that we
need stability we must introduce it by deliberate policy measures.
These conclusions may not strike the reader as particularly rev-
olutionary at the present time, but they certainly contradicted the
prevailing wisdom at ,the time they were written in Aprilt'ay
1985. There was widespread malaise about the instability of ex-
change rates, but belief in the magic of the market was still run-
ning strong, and the famous Plaza agreement in September 1985
came as something of a shock to market participants. Even today,
there is no theoretical underpinning for the contention that a
freely floating exchange rate system is cumulatively destabilizing.
That is what I hope to have provided here.
&
I have been speculating in currencies ever since they started
floating, but I have failed to make money on a consistent basis.
On balance, I traded profitably tluough 1980 and then chalked up
losses between 1981 and 1985. My approach has been tentative,
based more on intuition than on conviction. By temperament, I
have always been more interested in picking the turning point
than in following a trend. I managed to catch both the rise and
fall of European currencies against the dollar until 1981, but I
traded myself out of my positions too soon. Having lost the trend,
I found it too demeaning to start following the trend-followers; I
tried to pick the reversal point instead-needless to say, without
success. I had so-me temporary profits in the early part of 1984,
but I gave them all back. 1 was again engaged in a speculation
against the dollar at the time I wrote this chapter [AprilJMay
1985). Writing it has undoubtedly helped to clarify my thoughts.

, as a practical test of the theory propounded here. Admittedly the
theory is far too abstract to be of much use in making concrete
predictions. Specifically, the turning point cannot be determined
until it has actually occurred. But, as we shall see, the theory can
be very useful in interpreting events as they unfold.

THE CREDlT AhW REGULATORY CYCLE *
There seems to be a special affinity between reflexivity and credit.
That is hardly surprising: credit depends on expectations; expec-
tations involve bias; hdnce credit is one of the main avenues that
permit bias to play a causal role in the course of events. But there
is more to it. Credit seems to be associated with a particular kind
of reflexive pattern that is known as boom and bust. The pattern
is asymmetrical: the boom is drawn out and accelerates gradually;
the bust is sudden and often catastrophic. By contrast, when
credit is not an essential ingredient in a reflexitlreprocess, the
pattern tends to be more symmetrical. For instance, in the cur-
rency market it does not seem to make much difference whether
the dollar is rising or falling: the exchange rate seems to follow a
wavelike pattern.
I believe the asymmetry arises out of a reflexive connection
between loan and collateral. In this context I give collateral a very
broad definition: it will denote whatever determines the credit-
worthiness of a debtor, whether it is actually pledged or not. It
may mean a piece of property or an expected future stream of
income; in either case, it is something on which the lender is
willing to place a value. Valuation is supposed to be a passive
relationship in which the value reflects the underlying asset; but
in this case it involves a positive act: a loan is made. The act of
lending may affect the collateral value: that is the connection that
gives rise to a reflexive process.

==================================================

82 Theory
It will be recalled that we have analyzed reflexivity as two con-
nections working in opposite directions: the "normal" connec-
tion where a value is placed on future events, as in the stock
market or banking-we have called it the cognitive function; and
a "perverse" connection in which expectations affect that which
is expected-we have called it the participating function. The
participating function is perverse because its effect is not always
felt, and when it does operate its influence is so difficult to dis-
entangle that it tends to go unrecognized. The prevailing view of
how financial markets operate tends to leave the participating
function out of account. For instance, in the international lending
boom, bankers did not recognize that the debt ratios olr borrowing
countries were favorably influenced by their own lending activ-
ity. In the conglomerate boom, investors did not realize that per-
share earnings growth can be affected by the valuation they place
on it. At present, most people do not realize that the erosion of
collateral values can depress the economy.
The act of lending usually stimulates economic activity. It en-
ables the borrower to consume more than he would otherwise, or
to invest in productive assets. There are exceptions, to be sure: if
the assets in question are not physical but financial ones, the
effect is not necessarily stimulative. By the same token, debt ser-
vice has a depressing impact. Resources that would otherwise be
devoted to consumption or the creation of a future stream of in-
come are withdrawn. As the total amount of debt outstanding
accumulates, the portion that has to be utilized for debt service
increases. It is only net new lending that stimulates, and total
new lending has to keep rising in order to keep net new lending
stable.
The connection between lending and economic activity is far
from straightforward (that is, in fact, the best justification for the
monetarists' preoccupation with money supply, to the neglect of
credit). The major difficulty is that credit need not be involved in
the physical production or consumption of goods and services; it
may be used for purely financial purposes. In this case, its influ-
ence on economic activity becomes problematic. For purposes of
this discussion it may be helpful to distinguish between a "real"
economy and a "financial" economy. Economic activity takes
place in the "real" economy, while the extension and repayment
of credit occur in the "financial" economy. The reflexive interac-
tion between the act of lending and the value of the collateral may

The Credit and Regulatory Cycle 83
then connect the "real" and the "financial" economy or it may be
confined to the "financitil" economy. Here we shall focus on the
first case.
A strong economy tends to enhance the asset values and income
streams that serve to determine creditworthiness. In the early
stages of a reflexive prdcess of credit expansion the amount of
credit involved is relatively small so that its impact on collateral
values is negligible. Thdt is why the expansionary phase is slow
to start with and credit remains soundly based at first. But as the
amount of debt accumulates, total lending increases in impor-
tance and begins to have an appreciable effect on collateral val-
ues. The process continves until a point is reached where total
credit cannot increase fast enough to continue stimulating the
economy. By that time, collateral values have become greatly de-
pendent on the stimulative effect of new lending and, as new
lending fails to accelerate, collateral values begin to decline. The
erosion of collateral values has a depressing effect on economic
activity, which in turn reinforces the erosion of collateral values.
Since the collateral has'been pretty fully utilized at that point, a
decline may precipitate the liquidation of loans, which in turn
may make the decline more precipitous. That is the anatomy of a
'
typical boom and bust.
Booms and busts are not symmetrical because, at the inception
of a boom, both the volume of credit and the value of the collateral
are at a minimum; at the time of the bust, both are a pm aximum.
But there is another factor at play. The liquidation of loans takes
time; the faster it has to be accomplished, the greater the effect on
the value of the collateral. In a bust, the reflexive interaction be-
tween loans and collateral becomes compr~ssedw ithin a very
short time frame and the consequences can be catastrophic. It is
the sudden liquidation of accumulated positions that gives a bust
such a different shape from the preceding boom.
It can be seen that the boomhust sequence is a particular var-
iant of reflexivity. Booms can arise whenever there is a two-way
connection between values and the act of valuation. The act of
valuation takes many forms. In the stock market, it is equity that
is valued; in banking, it is collateral. It is possible, although un-
likely, that a boom could be generated without any credit expan-
sion. The two examples we studied in the stock market, the REIT
and conglomerate booms, could, in theory, have unfolded with-
out the stocks being used as collateral, although in practice there

was a lot of credit involved. In the absence of credit the reversal
would be a more gradual process. The contraction would not be a
t
mirror image of the expansion for the reason mentioned earlier-
the reflexive element in valuations is greater at the time of rever-
sal than at the inception of a trend-but the compression that is
characteristic of busts would be absent.
Both the boodust pattern and its explanation are almost too
obvious to be interesting. The amazing thing is that the reflexive
connection between lending and collateral has not been generally
recognized. There is an enormous literature on the trade cycle,
but I have not seen much awareness of the reflexive relationship
described here. Moreover, the trade cycles that-are gemrally dis-
cussed in textbooks differ in duration from the credit cycle I am
discussing here: they are short-tenn fluctuations within a larger
t pattern. There is an awareness of a larger cycle, usually referred
to as the Kondratieff wave,-but it has never been "scientifically"
explained. At present, there is much concern that we may be
approaching another recession but the general assumption is that
we are dealing with a recession just like any other; the fact that
we are in the declining phase of the larger cycle is usually left out
of account. I contend that all previous recessions since the end of
World War 11 occurred while credit was expanding, while the one
we may or may not be facing now would occur when borrowing
capacity in the real economy is contracting. This creates a situa-
tion that has no precedent in recent history.
Exactly where we are in the larger cycle is difficult to deter-
mine. I must confess I have been confused on the issue since 1982.
The reason for my confusion is that while the boom has clearly
sun out of steam, the bust has not taken place.
'
Busts can be very disruptive, especially if the liquidation of
collateral causes a sudden compression of credit. The conse-
quences are so unpleasant that strenuous efforts are made to avoid
them. The institution of central banking has evolved in a continu-
ing attempt to prevent sudden, catastrophic contractions in
credit. Since a panic is hard to arrest once it has started, preven-
tion is best practiced in the expansionary phase. That is why the
role of central banks has gradually expanded to include the regu-
lation of the money supply. That is also why organized financial
markets regulate the ratio of collateral to credit.
Until now, the authorities have been able to prevent a bust. We
find ourselves in a twilight zone where the "normal" process of

The Credit and Regulatory Cycle 85
credit expansion culminated long ago but the "normal" process
of credit contraction has been prevented by the authorities. We
are in uncharted territory because the actions of the authorities
have no precedent.
The fact that banks and organized financial markets are regu-
lated complicates the Course of events tremendously. Financial
history is best interpreted as a reflexive process in which there
are two sets of participants instead of one: competitors and regu-
lators.
Such a system is much more complex than the case we studied
in the stock market. There, the regulatory environment was more
or less fixed: it was the backdrop against which the drama was
acted out. Here, the regulatory environment is an integral part of
the process.
~t is important to realize that-the regulators are also partici-
pants. There is a natural tendency to regard them as superhuman
beings who somehow stand outside and above the economic pro-
cess and intervene only when the participants have made a mess
of it. That is not the case. They also are human, all too human.
They operate with imperfect understanding and their activities
have unintended consequences. Indeed, they seem to adjust to
changing circumstances less well than those who are motivated
by profit and loss, so that regulations are generally designed to
prevent the last mishap, not the next one. The deficiencies of
regulation tend to be more noticeable when conditi~asr e rapidly
changing, and conditions tend to change more rapidly when the
economy is less regulated.
We begin to discern a reflexive relationship between the regu-
lators and the economy they regulate. It gives rise Po a process
that takes place concurrently with the process of credit expansion
and contraction and interacts with it. It is no wonder that the
result is so complex and perplexing!
The regulatory cycle does not have the asymmetric character of
the credit ~ycleI.t seems to fit the wave pattern we developed for
the currency market better than the boom and bust pattern of the
credit cycle. Just as freely floating currencies tend to fluctuate
between over- and undervaluation, so market economies tend to
fluctuate between over- and underregulation. The length of the
cycle seems to be correlated with the credit cycle and one can
sense intuitively why that should be so. Credit expansion and
contraction have much to do which changes in the economy,

which in turn have a bearing on the adequacy of regulations.
,
Conversely, the regulatory environment influences not only how
fast credit can expand but also how far. Clearly, there is a two-
way connection between credit and regulation, but it is far from
clear to me at this stage of the investigation what pattern, if any,
the interaction follows. That is the main source of my confusion.
We have identified a credit cycle that follows a boom/bust pat-
tern: a regulatory cycle that is more wavelike, and an interplay
between the two whose pattern is unclear. There are, of course,
many secular developments involved as well, some of which re-
late to credit, some to regulation, and some to both. We have
mentioned that central banks tend to get stronger after each crisis;
that is a secular development that renders each cycle unique. In
the Great Depression both the banking system and the interna-
4 tional trading system collapsed, making the contraction of credit
and economic activity much more severe than it would have been
otherwise. We can be certain that every effort will be made to
avoid a similar collapse in this cycle. We did not dwell on the
information revolution or on the improvements in transportation
that have helped the development of an integrated world econ-
omy. The outcome of all these influences is a unique course of
events that is easier to explain than to predict.
Looked at from this perspective, the entire postwar period is
part of a large expansionary boom that is now well advanced and
ripe for a bust. The bust has been avoided, however, by the inter-
vention of the authorities at crucial moments. The interplay be-
tween government actions and the market mechanism has given
rise to a unique constellation that I have called Reagan's Imperial
Circle. We are now at the crucial moment where the Imperial
Circle is beginning to unwind and the au+thorities must invent
another solution to forestall a bust.
The same postwar period has also seen an almost complete
swing from government regulation to unrestrained competition.
We are now at a curious moment where the bias in favor of dereg-
ulation is still on the rise yet the need for government interven-
tion in specific areas is beginning to reassert itself. The banking
industry, for one, is already on the way to becoming more regu-
lated.
One could try and write a history of the postwar era in these
terms. The present credit cycle started after the end of World War
11; the origins of the regulatory cycle go back even farther to the

New Deal, although the creation of the Bretton Woods system can
be taken as the starting point as far as the world economy is
concerned. The expansion that followed was intimately related to
the removal of restrictions on international trade and investment.
But international capital movements created problems for the
Bretton Woods system that were never anticipated and remain
unresolved.
I shall not attempt to present the complete story here. 1 shall
start at the point where I became actively involved and I shall
follow the path of my own involvement. This will give the inves-
tigation a more experimental character.
My experiences began after the breakdown of the system of
fixed exchange rates in 1973. Relationships that had been fixed
became subject to reflexive influences and my interest veered
from specific companies and industries to macroeconomic pro-
cesses. My study of "growth banks" in 1972 constituted a transi-
tion point, although I did not know it at the time.
With the passage of time I found the instability of macroecon-
omic trends increasingly disturbing in both a subjective and an
objective sense and I decided to distance myself from active in-
vesting in 1981. After the crisis of 1982 I made a theoretical study
of the international debt problem. I was under the mistaken
impression that the crisis of 1982 constituted the climax in the
process of credit expansion. I thought that the authorities were
not doing enough to prevent a bust; I failed to regize that they
were doing too much. They actually kept credit expanding, albeit
on a more unsound basis than ever. The United States replaced
less developed countries as the "borrower of last resort" and com-
mercial banks tried to grow their way out of the loans made ta
less developed countries by aggressively expanding in other di-
rections. This led to another series of crises in 1984 that consti-
tuted the real turning point for the banking and thrift industries.
We are now suffering from the aftereffects of that climax. The
United States government continues to borrow on an ever-
increasing scale, but here, too, a turning point is at hand. The
dollar has begun to decline and foreigners are going to be repaid
in a depreciating currency. Perhaps the last great engine of credit
creation that is still going full blast is in the stock market where
mergermania is at its peak; but it does not have a stimulating
effect on the real economy.

tory cycle became somewhat clearer to me in the course of writing
this book, although I cannot claim that the process of clarification
I
is complete. Nevertheless, I felt it was appropriate to summarize
it at this point. I shall now use the theoretical framework outlined
here to explain the course of events since 1972. The reader should
be advised that the writing of the explanation predates the for-
mulation of this admittedly tentative theoretical framework.
P. S., DECEMBER 1986
Having completed the explanation, I engaged in a real-time exper-
iment from August 1985 to the end of 1986, trying to predict th.e
evolution of the credit and regulatory cycle. I came to a strange
conclusion. It appears that the cycle got stuck in 1982. If it had
4 not been for the successful intervention of the monetary authori-
ties, the international debt crisis would have led to a collapse of
the banking system. As it is, the collapse has been avoided, but
the genuine trend reversal which it would have ushered in also
failed to take place. We now live in a system where we contin-
ually go to the brink and then recoil when we see the abyss open-
ing up at our feet. The cohesion we manage to muster in the sight
of a disaster tends to disintegrate as soon as the danger recedes,
and the process then repeats itself in different forms. We can
observe it in international lending; in the U.S. budget deficit; in
the international monetary system; in OPEC; in the banking sys-
tem; in financial markets; and 1987 will undoubtedly be the year
when protectionism drives the international trade system to the
brink of collapse but probably not beyond it.

THE INTERNATIONAL DEBT PROBLEM
The greatest problem in *eflexivity analysis is to decide what ele-
ments to single out for attention. In dealing with a financial mar-
ket the problem is relatjvely simple. The critical variable is the
market price and the elements that need to be considered are
those that influence market prices. But even here the number of
factors that may come into play is almost infinite. Using just one
underlying trend and one predominant bias is an oversimplifica-
tion that may be useful in demonstrating the dynamics, not to say
dialectics, of a historical process, but it is totally inadequate to
explain, let alone predict, the actual course of events?
When we venture outside the confines of a particular market,
the problem of selection is even more complex. We need a set of
.
interacting components that can explain the phenomenon we are
dealing with. But there may be different sets that could explain
the same phenomenon and we can have no assurance that we
have selected the right one. The plethora of potential components
is particularly troubling when we try to predict the future course
of events: we do not know which one will become significant.
The boom and bust in international lending is a case in point.
It is an indispensable element in the current economic situation.
Taken by itself, it constitutes an almost perfect example of a
boomhust sequence. Looked at in the context of the overall situ-
ation, it is just one of many elements that need to be taken into
account. To complicate matters, the international debt problem
has played a crucial role in the evolution of the banking system,
and the evolution of the banking system is also a reflexive process

that is significant in itself as well as being a significant element in
the overall situation.
I
What is, then, the best way to deal with international lending?
One has to consider the subject from at least three points of view:
as a reflexive phenomenon in its own right; as a factor in the
evolution of the banking system; and as part of the current eco-
nomic situation. I shall try to consider all three at the same time
because that is the only way to avoid undue repetition. By choos-
ing this route, I shall also provide a practical demonstration of
the complexity of reflexive processes in the real world. It goes
without saying that the analysis is not an easy one to follow; but
I shall try to keep the three points sf view separate as we go dong.
Some degree of distortion is inevitable: since we are interested in
the evolution of the banking system, we shall pay more attention
I
to the lenders than the borrowers. If we wanted to explore the fate
of the less developed countries, we would have to shift our focus.
The origins of the international lending boom go back at least
as far as the first oil shock in 1973; but to discuss the evolution of
the banking system we have to go back even farther, and to under-
stand the economic cycle that has dominated recent history we
ought to start with the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system
in 1971. That would take us too far back; so I shall take early 1972
as my starting point, and I shall begin by looking at the banking
system in the United States. As it happens, that is the date of a
stock market report I wrote entitled "The Case for Growth Banks."
Banks at the time were considered the stodgiest of institutions.
Managements had been traumatized by the failures of the 1930s
and safety was the paramount consideration, overshadowing
profit or growth. The st~dctureo f the industry was pracirical'ly
frozen by regulation. Expansion across state lines was prohibited
and in some states even branch banking was outlawed. A dull
business attracted dull people and there was little movement or
innovation in the industry. Bank stocks were ignored by investors
looking for capital gains.
Underneath the calm surface, changes were brewing. A new
breed of bankers was emerging who had been educated in busi-
ness schools and thought in terms of bottom-line profits. The
spiritual center of the new school of thinking was First National
City Bank of New York, and people trained there were fanning
out and occupying top spots at other banks. New kinds of finan-
cial instruments were being introduced, and some banks were

beginning to utilize their capital more aggressively and putting
together very creditabld earnings performances. There were some
acquisitions within state limits, leading to the emergence of larger
units. The larger banks typically leveraged their equity 14 to 16
times, with the Bank oflAmericar unning as high as 20 times. The
better banks showed a keturn on equity in excess of 13%. In any
other industry, such a ceturn on equity, combined with per-share
earnings growth of better than 10% would have been rewarded
by the shares selling at a decent premium over asset value, but
bank shares were selling at little or no premium. Analysts of bank
shares were aware of this relative undervaluation but they de-
spaired of seeing the situation corrected because the underlying
changes were too gradual and the prevailing valuation too stable.
Yet, many banks had reached the point where they were pushing
against the limits of what was considered prudent leverage by the
standards of the time. 'If they wanted to continue growing they
would need to raise additional equity capital.
It was against this background that First National City hosted a
dinner for security analysts-an unheard-of event in the banking
industry. I was not invited but it prompted me to publish a report
that recommended purchase of a bouquet of the more aggressively
managed banks. It documented the situation I have described here
and it argued that bank stocks were about to come alive because
managements had a good story to tell and they had started telling
it. "Growth" and "banks" seemed like a contradicthn in terms, I
wrote, but the contradiction was about to be resolved by bank
' shares being awarded growth multiples.
Banks stocks did, in fact, have a good move in 1972 and we
made aSou4 50% on our bouquet. Some of the more alert banks
managed to raise some capital. If the process of raising capital at
a premium over book value had become established, banks could
have expanded on a sound basis and the evolution of the banking
system would have taken a different course. As it happened, the
process had hardly started when inflation accelerated, interest
rates rose, and a 13% return on capital was no longer sufficient to
enable banks to sell shares at a premium.
Then came the aftermath of the first oil shock and a tremendous
increase in the flow of funds to the oil-producing countries. These
countries did not know what to do with the money and it piled
up in the banks. A point was reached when some banks, like
Bankers Trust, felt obliged to turn away deposits. How to recycle

these so-called petrodollars became a major problem. There were
active discussions about intergovernmental schemes but nothing
much came out of them except for some increased Saudi contri-
butions to the IMF and th;! World Bank. The governments of the
industrialized world failed dismally to rise to the occasion and it
was by default that the recycling of petrodollars was left to the
banks.
The banks stepped into the breech and fulfilled their function
all too well. Flush with funds, they became aggressive lenders,
and they found plenty of takers. Less developed countries with-
out oil sought to finance their deficits by running up large debts;
thoss with oil embarked on an~bitiouse xpansion programs,
which they financed by borrowing on the strength of their oil
reserves. This was the time of detente, which meant that Eastern
I
European countries borrowed huge amounts from Western banks
in the hope of repaying them using the products of the factories
they built with borrowed money. That is how the international
lending boom began.
At first, the banks were recycling the OPEC surplus. As time
passed, the oil-rich countries found other ways of utilizing their
new-found wealth: acquiring the most sophisticated armaments,
expanding their economy at a breakneck pace, buying diamonds
and real estate, and making other long-term investments. Mean-
while, demand for bank financing continued to build. Increas-
ingly, the banks became the source of credit. Each loan created
deposits elsewhere so that the banks were able to generate the
funds they were lending by their own activity. Since the Eurodol-
lar market was not regulated, banks did not have to maintain
minimum reserve raquirements against the liabilities of their off-
shore affiliates. There was nothing to stop those affiliates from
creating a seemingly unlimited supply of credit except self-re-
straint.
But international lending was too profitable to leave much
room for caution. Business could be transacted on a large scale,
the risk of adverse interest rate movements could be minimized
by the use of floating rates, and administrative costs were much
lower than in the case of corporate loans. Fierce competition kept
spreads between borrowing and lending rates quite narrow;
nevertheless, international lending became one of the easiest and
most profitable forms of banking activity, attracting many banks
with no previous experience in the field. The number of banks

represented in London grew greatly during this period, and inter-
national lending became the fastest growing sector of the banking
industry. Naturally, if banks had set up reserves that would have
been appropriate in the light of subsequent experience, the
business would not hafre been as profitable as it seemed at the
time. II
The external shape ,of the U.S. banking industry remained
largely stagnant duringlthis period. Expansion by way of mergers
and acquisitions was strictly circumscribed by regulation. But the
internal structure of banks underwent considerable transforma-
tion. The main corporate trend was the formation of bank holding
companies. The change of format allowed additional leveraging
at the holding company level so that the ratio of capital to total
assets continued to deteriorate. Moreover, the so-called Edge Act
subsidiaries escaped some of the regulatory restrictions imposed
on banks. The greatest scope was abroad. Accordingly, most of
the corporate moves were international with American banks ex-
panding abroad and foreign banks establishing footholds in the
United States. For instance, more than a quarter of Citicorp's earn-
i7s came from Brazil.
t was also a time oflr apid technological innovations. The use
of computers speeded up activities and permitted operations that
would have been previously inconceivable. Many new financial
instruments and financing techniques were invented and banking
became a much more sophisticated business than it had been only
a decade ago. These trends continue at an accelerae pace to the
present day.
The task of the regulators was complicated both by the pace of
ianovation and by the international character of the competition.
It is not unfair to say that the regulators were always lagging a
step behind the practitioners and the industry became adept at
finding a way around whatever regulations were imposed.
In the international arena the authorities did not want to hinder
their own industry from competing on equal terms. With no reg-
ulatory constraints and individual banks competing for market
share, the market as a whole grew by leaps and bounds. Banks
were so anxious to obtain business that they asked very few ques-
tions. It is amazing how little information borrowing countries
had to supply in order to obtain loans. Lending banks did not
even know how much money the countries in question were bor-
rowing elsewhere.

96 Historical Perspective
Debtor countries preferred to deal with commercial banks
I rather than go to the International Monetary Fund when they
were in balance-of-payments difficulties. Unwittingly, commer-
cial banks took over one of the functions that the Bretton Woods
institutions-the IMF and the World Bank-had been designed
to fulfill. They tranferred resources to less developed countries
on a much larger scale than the Bretton Woods institutions would
have been willing to countenance, and with much less interfer-
ence in the debtor countries' affairs. No wonder that less devel-
oped countries stayed away from the IMF! Mainly industrialized
countries like the United Kingdom asked for support from the
IMF; developing co~ntriesc ould do better with co~rm~ercial
banks. There was a veritable explosion of international credit be-
tween 1973 and 1979. It was the foundation of the worldwide
I
inflationary boom of the 1970s, which eventually culminated in
the second oil shock.
In retrospect it is obvious that the borrowers spent the money
unwisely. At best they built white elephants like the Itaipu Dam
in Brazil; at worst they spent it on armaments or used it to main-
tain unrealistically high exchange rates as in the "southern cone"
countries of Argentina and Chile. At the time, the folly was not
recognized. Indeed, Brazil was regarded as an economic miracle
and Chile was praised as a paragon of monetarist virtue.
International lending grew so rapidly that the banks involved
became overextended: their capital and reserves could not keep
pace with the growth of their balance sheets. But the quality of
their loan portfolios remained sound-at least outwardly. Indeed,
one of the most striking features of the situation was that the
borrowing countries continued to meet the traditional yardsticks
used to determine their creditworthiness even as their overall
debt burden grew at an alarming rate.
Banks use ratios-such as external debt as a percentage of ex-
ports, debt service as a percentage of exports, and current deficits
as a percentage of exports-to measure creditworthiness. The in-
ternational lending activity of the banks set in motion a self-rein-
forcing and self-validating process that increased the debt-
servicing ability of the debtors, as measured by these ratios, al-
most as fast as their debt.
The key to the process is to be found in the very low and,
eventually, negative real interest rates that prevailed during the
1970s. Since the Eurocurrency market was outside the control of

The International Debt Problem 97
the central banks, its growth did not directly influence monetary
policy in any country. As the banks graduated from recycling
OPEC surpluses to creating credit, the monetary policy of the
United States remained relaxed. The dollar started to depreciate,
and interest rates failed to keep up with the rise in prices. The
decline in real interesi rates lowered the cost of debt service and
rendered the borrowing countries more creditworthy. It also made
them more eager to bbrrow. The expansion of credit stimulated
the world economy and helped export performance all around.
The less developed countries enjoyed strong demand for the com-
modities they exported; thus their terms of trade also tended to
improve. The combination of declining real interest rates, ex-
panding world trade, improving commodity prices, and the de-
preciating dollar enabled and encouraged the debtor countries to
increase their indebtedness.
The self-validating process of credit expansion-inflation for
short-was unsound in more ways than one. Prices and wages
rose at accelerating rates. Balance-of-payments deficits and sur-
pluses were perpetuated. The balance sheets of the banks deteri-
orated. Much of the investment activity financed by bank lending
- was misdirected. The creditworthiness of the debtors was illu-
sow Yet, as long as the process validated itself, the world econ-
omy prospered. Consumption remained high while saving was
discouraged by low or negative interest rates. Investment was
stimulated by the availability of cheap loans, there was a
flight from monetary to real assets. The combination of high con-
sumption, high inventories, and strong investment activity cre-
ated boom conditions.
The boom kept the demand for energy growing. The OPEC
countries grew richer and less in need of current income, while
negative real interest rates made it more attractive to keep oil in
the ground than cash in the bank. This provided the setting in
which the disruption of Iranian production in 1979 caused a sec-
ond crisis and a second jump in the price of oil.
This time the response was different. Inflation had become a
dominant concern, especially in the United Kingdom and the
United States. Continental Europe and Japan had escaped the rav-
ages of inflation by following a more restrictive monetary policy
and allowing their currencies to appreciate. Since the price of oil
is fixed in dollars, the cost of oil to Europe and Japan fell, and, in
the absence of inflation, their exports remained competitive de-

spite the appreciation of their currencies. The United Kingdom
and the United States, by contrast, developed large budgetary and
trade deficits, and inflation became a serious problem. Britain had
to turn to the IMF for help. The United States, controlling as it
did the reserve currency of the world, could inflate with impu-
nity; nevertheless, the domestic and international consequences
of inflation led to a shift in political preferences. The specter of
accelerating inflation took precedence over the fear of recession.
In response to the second oil shock, monetary policy turned re-
strictive and remained so even after the economy started to de-
cline.
Monetarism became the doctrine that guided eeonornic policy.
Previously, central banks sought to influence economic activity
by controlling interest rates; now the emphasis shifted to control-
I
ling the quantity of money. Interest rates were allowed to find
their own level. Unfortunately, the level they found was inordi-
nately high. The main reason was that fiscal policy remained
stimulative, and it required a highly restrictive monetary policy
to keep the growth in money supply in check.
Fiscal policy was influenced by supply-side economics. It was
believed that lower tax rates would stimulate economic activity
to such an extent that the impact on the budget would be neutral-
ized. The deficit could then be reduced by cutting government
spending. But the decision to increase defense expenditures at
the same time as taxes were cut made a balanced budget unattain-
able. The interaction between a swelling budget deficit and strict
monetary targets sent interest rates sky high. High interest rates
swamped the stimulative effect of the tax cuts. The budget deficit
widened, and the economy plunged into a deep recession.
The impact on the rest of the world was awesome. The debtor
countries were hit by a threefold increase in oil prices, plunging
commodity prices, soaring interest rates, a strong dollar, and a
worldwide recession. They engaged in a final binge of borrowing
that increased their total debt outstanding another 30%, but the
ratios measuring their creditworthiness rapidly deteriorated. The
situations in Poland and in the Falklands helped to undermine
confidence. There was a twilight period during which banks con-
tinued to lend, but reluctantly. Maturities were shortened, and
some countries developed liquidity problems. Then the Mexican
debt crisis erupted in 1982, and voluntary lending to the heavily
indebted countries came to a virtual standstill. The position of

the debtors was much worse than most bankers had realized. For
instance, Brazil was using the interbank market to finance its
balance-of-payments deficit, unbeknownst to the correspondent
banks. The international lending boom turned into a bust.
We shall pause at this: point to analyze the international lending
boom as a reflexive process in its own right. The above descrip-
tion contains all the necessary ingredients of a boorntbust se-
quence. What are they? 'First, there must be a reflexive connection
between the underlying trend and the participants' perception.
Second, there must be a flaw in the participants' perception that
influences the underlying trend through a reflexive connection.
The trend reinfomes the bias until a point is reached where they
both become unsustainable. Typically, the trend appears to be
sound when it is first established and the flaws become apparent
only when the trend is already well advanced. There is a twilight
period during which the participants grow increasingly leery and
reluctant, and the trend loses momentum. Eventually, the reali-
zation that the trend is unsound and unsustainable comes crash-
ing in. The prophecy is self-fulfilling and the trend is reversed,
often with catastrophic consequences.
In the case of international lending, there are a number of re-
flexive connections between the banks and the debtor countries.
Banks use debt ratios to measure a country's capacity to borrow.
These ratios were generally considered to be objective measure-
ments, whereas in fact they are reflexive. As we kve seen, both
exports and GNP are influenced by the volume of international
lending in a number of ways. Moreover, debt ratios measure only
a debtor country's capacity to pay, not its willingness. To measure
willingness a differentc alculation is needed vcrhich is essentially
political in character. The critical variable is not debt service but
net resource transfer, that is, the differenceb etween debt service
and the inflow of new credit. As long as debtor countries can
borrow freely their willingness to pay is not in doubt: they can
always borrow the money they need to pay the interest. But as
soon as the flow of credit is interrupted, the willingness to pay
becomes the critical issue. Bankers refused to face the issue dur-
ing the great lending boom. Walter Wriston of Citicorp asserted
that "sovereign nations don't go bankrupt. "
As we have seen, debt ratios remained largely satisfactory until
the second oil shock, and banks were eager to lend. When debt
ratios finally began to deteriorate, the banks started to worry and

100 Historical Perspective
their willingness to lend was impaired, precipitating the crisis of
4 1982. The crisis brought the reflexive connection between net
resource transfers and willingness to pay into play, leading to a
permanent breakdown in voluntary lending. What happened af-
terward will be the subject of the next chapter. Here we are con-
cerned with analyzing the system that prevailed until 1982.
Why the commercial banks were willing and able to sustain
such explosive growth in their international loan portfolios is a
fascinating question that will be hotly debated for years to come.
Part of the answer is that banks did not consider themselves re-
sponsible for the soundness of the system. Banking is an intensely
competitive business, whichis, however, subject to regulation.
It is the job of the central banks to prevent excesses. Commer-
cia1 banks operate under a protective umbrella; they seek to max-
4
imize their profits within the framework of existing regulations
and they cannot afford to pay too much attention to the systemic
effects of their activities. A commercial banker who refuses to go
after what seems like profitable business is liable to be pushed to
the side, and even if a bank decided to abstain there are many
others anxious to take its place. Thus, even those who realized
that the international lending boom was unsound found them-
selves obliged to participate or lose their places.
There is an important lesson here: participants are not in a
position to prevent a boom from developing even if they recog-
nize that it is bound to lead to a bust. That is true of all boomhust
sequences. Abstaining altogether is neither possible nor advis-
able. For instance, in my analysis of mortgage trusts I clearly
predicted a bad end, yet mv advice was to buy now because the
shares would have to rise substantially before they crashed. As it
happened, a certain class of investors responded with alacrity.
But even if they had not done so, the boomhust sequence would
have occurred, albeit more slowly.
The best that a participant can do is to cease to be a participant
at the right time. But that may not always be possible. For in-
stance, in a system of fluctuating exchange rates, holders of finan-
cial assets have an existential choice in deciding what currency
to hold: they cannot avoid holding some currency, except by buy-
ing options. In the case of international lending, Citicorp deliber-
ately reduced its market share in the later stages of the boom; but
that did not stop the drama from unfolding and Citicorp from
being caught up in it. Toward the end most banks knew that the

position of the debtor countries was rapidly deteriorating, yet
they could not disengaie themselves.
The lesson to be learned is that financial markets need to be
supervised. Only some, kind of intervention, be it legislative, reg-
ulatory, or a gentle hipt from a central bank, can prevent boom/
bust sequences from getting out of hand.
The history of centrtfl banking is a history of crises followed by
institutional reform. It is truly surprising that the lessons of the
international debt crisis have still not been learned. The cham-
pions of unregulated competition are more vocal, and more influ-
ential, than ever. They base their case on the inefficiency of
regulators and i$ must be admitted that they have a point. The
participants could not have prevented the international lending
boom from getting out of hand, but the monetary authorities could
have. Why did they fail to do so?
There is no clear answer to this question. Central banks were
aware of the explosive growth of the Eurodollar market, although
they lacked reliable st,atistics. They recognized their responsibil-
ities as lenders of last resort and mapped out their respective
spheres of responsibility as early as 1975, but they did not deem
it necessary to regulate the growth of Eurodollar lending. Why?
The question requires more thorough historical research than it
has received so-far. I shall hazard two tentative hypotheses.
One is $at the central banks themselves were influenced by the
competitive pressures that affected the commercid banks under
their aegis. Had they imposed regulatory restrictions, the banks
under their supervision would have lost business to others. Only
concerted action by all the central banks could have brought the
burgeoning Eurodoiliw market under control. That would have
required institutional reform, and the monetary authorities did
not recognize the need for reform. Reform usually occurs after a
crisis, not before.
That is where the second hypothesis comes into play. I contend
that the central banks were acting under the influence of a false
ideology. It was a time when monetarism was gaining ground
among central bankers. Monetarism holds that inflation is a func-
tion of money and not of credit. If monetarism is valid, the growth
of money supply needs to be regulated, not the growth of credit.
Accordingly, there was no need to interfere with the Eurodollar
market: as long as the central banks regulate their own money
supply, the market will regulate itself.

102 Historical Perspective
' The issue is arcane and I cannot claim to understand it fully.
Money shows up on one side of the balance sheet of banks and
credit on the other. Milton Friedman tells us that it is the money
side that counts because the other side is determined by the
money side.2T he theory of reflexivity leads me to believe that his
theory is wrong. I would expect that the two sides influence each
other in a reflexive fashion, and his dream of controlling the
money supply is impractical. I lack sufficient expertise to take
him on directly, but I can point to the empirical evidence that
shows that the money supply always fails to behave in accor-
dance with the regulators' wishes.
\What role the growth of the Eurodollar market has played in
the worldwide inflation of the 1970s has never been decided. For
that matter, we do not know the extent to which the contraction
t
of international lending is responsible for the deflationary pres-
sures that seem to dominate the world economy at present. I
firmly believe that both the expansion and the contraction of in-
ternational lending have been important influences on the world
economy, but my view is far from being generally accepted, and
the issue remains unresolved to this day. If my view is correct,
the volume of international credit ought to be an important con-
sideration in setting economic policies. Monetary authorities
committed a serious error in allowing it to get out of hand during
the late 1970s. The crisis of 1982 is as much a failure of regulation
as a failure of the free market.
We shall return to this issue again later. The imperfection of
both regulated and free markets is one of the main themes of this
book. Now we have to deal with the new system of international
lending that evolved in response to the crisis of 1982.

THE COT.T.ECTIVE SYSTEM OF LENDING
4
There can be no doubt that without the active and imaginative
intervention of the authorities the international debt crisis would
have led to the collaise of the banking system, with disastrous
consequences for the world economy. The last time such a col-
lapse occurred was in' the 1930s. Because of that experience, an
institutional framework was established with a mandate to pre-
vent a recurrence. Therefore it is inconceivable that events would
have been allowed to unfold without intervention. It is the form
that the intervention took that created a situation without parallel
in history.'
rr*
The institutional setup gives central banks the authority, and
obligation, to act as lenders of last resort. But the debt problem
was too big to be handled by providing liquidity to the banks. The
amounts involved far exceeded the banks' own capital; if &e
countries in question had been allowed to go into default, the
banking system would have become insolvent. Accordingly,
the central banks exceeded their traditional role and banded to-
gether to bail out the debtor countries.
A precedent of sorts had been established in England in 1974,
when the Bank of England decided to bail out the so-called fringe
banks that were outside its sphere of responsibility rather than to
allow the clearing banks, from whom the fringe banks had bor-
rowed heavily, to come under suspicion. But the crisis of 1982
was the first time that the strategy of bailing out the debtors was
applied on an international scale.
The central banks did not have sufficient authority to execute

104 Historical Perspective
such a strategy, and makeshift arrangements had to be made in
which the governments of all the creditor countries participated
I
and the IMF played a key role. A rescue package was put together
for one country after another. Typically, commercial banks ex-
tended their commitments, the international monetary institu-
tions injected new cash, and the debtor countries agreed to
austerity programs designed to improve their balance of pay-
ments. In most cases, the commercial banks also had to come up
with additional cash enabling the debtor countries to stay current
on their interest payments. The rescue packages constituted a
remarkable achievement in international cooperation. The partic-
ipants included*theI nternational Monetary Fmd, the Esnk for
International Settlements. a number of governments and central
banks, and a much larger number of commercial banks. In the
case of Mexico, for instance, there were more than 500 commer-
cial banks involved. I shall refer to the participants as "the Collec-
tive."
The process was repeated several times over a short period of
gme. The story of what actually happened would make fascinat-
ing reading, but here we must confine ourselves to examining the
outcome.
The system of lending that emerged from the crisis is in many
ways the opposite of the system that broke down in 1982. The
prior system was competitive: banks were lending willingly, in
pursuit of profit and in sharp competition with each other. The
new system is cooperative: banks are lending under duress, in the
hope of protecting their already committed assets, and they act
jointly with other banks to this end. The prior system was reflex-
ive in a positive direction: the banks' willingness and ability io
lend were both reinforcing the debtor countries' ability and will-
ingness to pay, and vice versa. In the present situation, reflexivity
works in the opposite direction: it is the banks' inability and
unwillingness to lend and the debtor countries' inability and un-
willingness to pay that are mutually self-reinforcing. The system
could not survive without the various participants actively coop-
erating to prevent a collapse. Action by the lenders takes the form
of extending new credit in order to enable debtor countries to
service their existing debt; action by the borrowers consists of
accepting austerity programs that keep the amount of new credit
needed to a minimum. What that minimum is depends on deli-
cate negotiations between lenders and borrowers. The IMF has
taken the lead in conducting these negotiations, although debtor

countries are generally reluctant to allow the IMF a permanent
role in monitoring thelagreements.
The system is highly precarious because it requires both lend-
ers and borrowers to ,override their narrow self-interest for the
sake of remaining paq of the system. In the case of debtors, the
sacrifice is measured 6y negative resource transfers; in the case of
the banks, by the amount of new credit extended. The sacrifice is
not symmetrical, however, because the borrowers pay interest on
the newly extended credit, while the lenders receive it. Only if
the banks forgave some of the interest or principal would they
suffer an actual loss. But the Collective system of lending is based
on the principle that the integrity 3f debt must be preserved
!hm
-that is the principle that holds the Collective together. Unfor-
tunately, it leaves a crucial problem unresolved: debtor countries
need concessions to service their debt, but each concession adds
to their future obligations. Recognizing the problem, banks are
building bad debt reqerves; but no way has been found to pass
these reserves on to tfie debtor countries without destroying the
principle that holds the Collective together.
The Collective system of lending came into existence un-
planned and unannobnced. It has been transitional from its in-
ception and it is bound to lead to something else. The most
interesting question that can be asked about it is what its eventual
outcome will be. Unfortunately, this is not a question that can be
satisfactorily answered. For one thing, reflexive messes do not
have a predeteryined outcome: the outcome is determined in the
course of the process. For another, the prediction itself can influ-
ence the outcome. In this case, the hope that the Collectives will
accomplish their mission is one of the main forces holding them
together; any statement that has a bearing on that hope immedi-
ately becomes a part of the situation to which it refers, so that it
is impossible to keep the discussion objective. Nevertheless, the
question is pressing. Can the approach I have taken help to pro-
vide an answer? And can an answer help to develop a theory of
reflexivity?
I published two papers1-one in July 1983 and one in March
1984-in which I tried to analyze the international debt problem
using a theory of reflexivity but not spelling it out. This is what I
said (with minor modifications):
For heavily indebted countries, the collapse of voluntary lending
has forced a drastic readjustment. The readjustment can be divided

106 Historical Perspective
into four phases. In the first phase, imports decline; in the second,
4 exports increase. During the first two phases, domestic economic
activity slows. In the third, domestic economic activity recovers
and both imports and exports rise. In the fourth phase, the advance
in GDP and exports exceeds the increase in debt service require-
ments and the adjustment is complete.
The first phase is involuntary. When the flow of credit is cut off,
the trade deficit is automatically eliminated by a cut in imports.
Living standards are reduced, the production process may be dis-
rupted, and the country is plunged into depression. The amount of
lending required of the Collective is determined by the inability of
the debtor country quickly to generate a trade surplus sufficient to
cover debt service requirements.
It is in the second phase that the real adjustment begins. The
currency is devalued in real terms, and productive resources, idled
by the reduction in domestic demand, are reoriented toward ex-
ports. The trade balance improves, and the ability to service the
debt improves with it.
It is at this point that the willingness to pay and the willingness
to lend become crucial. The country in question must increase its
imports in order to support a domestic recovery. That means a
reduction in the amount available for negative resource transfer. If
the hurdle is passed, the third phase begins. Domestic recovery
renders negative resource transfer more palatable. As the economy
expands, the creditworthiness of the country begins to improve,
provided that exports grow faster than the GDP. When that hap-
pens, the adjustment process has been accomplished.
On the lending side, Collectives operate with a chronic shortage
of resources. Commercial banks can be divided into two categories:
those whose very survival is at stake and those who are only mar-
ginally involved. The first category co~stitutesth e sore cif ;El Col-
lectives. They can be counted upon Po participate, but their
capacity to do so is limited. Marginal members need more persua-
sion. As the sense of urgency diminishes, the marginals wish to
withdraw, leaving only majors to provide the flow of fresh credit.
The categories are flexible. The large U.S., U.K., and Japanese
banks will always remain core members; U.S. regionals and many
continental banks are marginal to start with. In between the two
groups there are many banks whose existence is at stake today but
who may be able to build up sufficient reserves over a period of
time to qualify as marginal in the future.
Because of the actual or potential shrinkage of membership, the
resources of the Collectives are liable to remain fully stretched.
The Collectives cannot meet the demands made upon them with-

out the injection of additional funds from international lending
institutions, but the institutions also are fully stretched. Thus, the
Collectives are bound to push for the maximum resource transfers,
making the hurdle between Phase 2 and Phase 3 difficult to pass.
I concluded that the'collective system of lending "is a system
born of emergency. It needs emergency conditions to survive, and
it is so constructed as 'to generate the emergency conditions that
are needed to keep it in existence."
By and large, this analytical framework stood the test of time,
although in retrospect+I did make two serious mistakes. First, I
argued that dsbtcr csuzttries were willing to tolerate negative re-
source transfers for two reasons: (1)t o maintain access to capital
markets and (2) to avoid seizure of assets. I neglected to consider
what turned out to be the most important reason: (3) to maintain
access to export markets. With domestic markets in shambles, the
threat that export markets might be closed off was a potent one.
Argentina was relatively the best situated to overcome an em-
bargo because most of 'its exports were fungible commodities, but
even Argentina sells many items, such as shoes and steel, that are
destined for specific markets. Moreover, the newly elected Argen-
tine government did not want to be isolated from the Western
world. It was determihed to avoid an "economic Falklands." As a
result, the threat of default never became as serious as I expected.
In my analysis I did not put much store in the &st two induce-
ments. As regards free access to capital markets, I maintained that
the system of lending that prevailed prior to 1982 had broken
down for good~Ith ad been based on certain misconceptions
which had been recognized es such. The pasitive bias had been
replaced by a negative one, and it would take a long time to
overcome it. Events have borne out this analysis: bank lending to
less developed countries is far below projections. As regards the
seizure of assets, I dismissed it as a more or less empty threat.
Since then this point of view has been fully doc~mentedH.~a ving
ignored the third and most potent inducement, I concluded that
"the only way to ensure that the debtor countries will honor their
debt is to make credit available in quantities that approximate
their debt service obligations."
This conclusion was false. In 1984 less than half the interest
had to be advanced in the form of new credit, and much of the
new credit came from sources other than the commercial banks.

108 Historical Perspective
' As a result, the cash drain on commercial banks was less severe
than I had envisioned, and the strain between core members and
marginal members never reached the breaking point. In fact, even
core members have been able to begin building reserves against
bad debts and improving their capital ratios.
The second mistake I made was to underestimate the ability of
debtor countries to increase exports. The world economy turned
out to be much stronger than I expected, for reasons that will be
discussed in the next chapter. Brazil, in particular, produced a
much larger trade surplus than I had expected. The official target
for 1984 was $9 billion; the actual figure exceeded $12 billion.
The strength in exporb led "i a modest domestic recovery and
enabled Brazil to enter Phase 3.
These two mistakes together were sufficient to render my anal-
t
ysis unduly pessimistic. In February 1984 I asserted that "it is
increasingly unlikely that much progress can be made in Phase 3,
and Phase 4 appears increasingly unattainable under the present
system." Yet by 1985 several of the major debtors had entered
Phase 3, and the worst seemed to be over. Then came the precip-
itous drop in oil prices in 1986, and Mexico became a casualty.
The emergency could be attributed to external causes, but recent
developments in Brazil are much more ominous. As a result of
the Cruzado Plan the economy became overheated in no time and
the international trade balance deteriorated dangerously. As soon
as the government was reelected in a landslide victory, it started
to rein in the economy. Even so, it is clear that domestic political
considerations take precedence over international debt obliga-
tions, and 1987 is likely to be a year of crisis in Brazilian debt
negotiations.
Positions have softened considerably on the part of the creditor
countries. U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker recognized the
need for domestic growth in the debtor countries in the plan he
launched at the Seoul meeting of the World Bank in October 1985.
Subsequently, the Bradley Plan expressly advocated forgiving a
portion of the interest and principal on the accumulated debt.
The fact is that the trade surpluses of the debtor countries have
become troublesome for the United States. The banks are better
reserved than they were a few years ago, so that 1987 may well
bring some measure of protection coupled with some measure of
loan forgiveness. If the experience of the last five years is any
guide, the changes will not be radical enough to cause a break-
down of the system.

Although it was faulty in its details, my analytical framework
remains valid in its broad outlines. It is not a blueprint for suc-
cessful adjustment but rather a model for surviving failure. As we
have seen, the Collective system is held together only by the
threat of a breakdown.,As we shall see, this is a characteristic of
many arrangements wgich have prevailed since 1982.

REAGm'S IMPERIAL CIRCLE *
At the time of the international debt crisis I was working with a
rather crude and inarticulate model of credit expansion and credit
contraction similar to a boom/bust sequence in the stockmarket. I
thought that 1982 was the end of a period of worldwide credit
expansion and failed to anticipate the emergence of the United
States as the "borrower of the last resort."
The large and growing U.S. budget deficit emerged as the unin-
tended consequence of conflicting policy objectives. On the one
hand, President Reagan sought to reduce the role of the federal
government in the economy by reducing taxes; on the other, he
wanted to assume a strong military posture in confronting what
he considered the Communist menace. These two objectives
could not be pursued within the constraints of a balanced budget.
To make matters worse, fiscal and monetary policies were dom-
inated by two conflicting schools of thought. Fiscal policy was
influenced by "supply-side" economics, whereas monetary pol-
icy was guided by the precepts of monetarism.
The supply-siders believed that a tax cut would have such a
stimulating effect both on output and on willingness to pay taxes
that the economy could grow at a rapid rate without exacerbating
inflation and the budget would be brought back into balance by
higher tax receipts. It was a thoroughly reflexive line of reasoning,
and it contained serious flaws, as such reasoning usually does. Its

validity hinged on its be,ing universally accepted; therefore, it was
an all or none proposition. In a democracy that functions by com-
promise, such propositions rarely prevail. In this case, the
chances of success were particularly poor because there was an-
other major school of t+ught influencing government policy.
Monetarists believed that the primary objective was to bring
inflation under control ~ ntdo t hat end the money supply must be
strictly regulated. Instead of controlling short-term interest rates,
as it had done hitherto, the Federal Reserve fixed targets for
money supply and allowed the rate on federal funds to fluctuate
freely. The Federal Reserve's new policy was introduced in Oc-
tober 1979, and interest rates were already at record levels when
President Reagan took office. In his first budget, he cut taxes and
increased military spending simultaneously. Although a con-
certed effort was made to reduce domestic spending, the savings
were not large enough to offset the other two items. The path of
least resistance led to a ,large budget deficit.
Since the budget deficit had to be financed within the limits of
strict money supply targets, interest rates rose to unprecedented
heights. Instead of economic expansion, the conflict between fis-
cal and monetary policy brought on a severe recession. Unexpect-
edly high interest rates combined with a recession to precipitate
the international debt 'crisis of 1982. Henry Kaufman had long
warned that government deficits would drive other borrowers out
of the market.' He proved to be right but it was theforeign gov-
ernments that were driven out first, not the domestic users of
credit.
The Federal Reserve responded to the Mexican crisis of August
1982 by relaxing its grip on the money supply. The budget &licit
was just beginning to accelerate. With the brakes released, the
economy took df and the recovery was as vigorous as the reces-
sion had been severe. It was aided by a spending spree by both
the private and the corporate sectors and it was abetted by the
banking system. Military spending was just gearing up; the pri-
vate sector enjoyed rising real incomes; the corporate sector ben-
efited from accelerated depreciation and other tax concessions.
Banks were eager to lend because practically any new lending
had the effect of improving the quality of their loan portfolios.
The demand emanating from all these sources was so strong
that interest rates, after an initial decline, stabilized at historically
high levels and eventually began to rise again. Banks bid for de-

* posits aggressively and holders of financial assets could obtain
even higher returns from the banks that from holding government
obligations. Foreign capital was attracted, partly by the high re-
turn on financial assets and partly by the confidence inspired by
President Reagan. The dollar strengthened and a strengthening
currency combined with a positive interest rate differential made
the move into the dollar irresistible. The strong dollar attracted
imports, which helped to satisfy excess demand and to keep
down the price level. A self-reinforcing process was set into mo-
tion in which a strong economy, a strong currency, a large budget
deficit, and a large trade deficit mutually reinforced each other to
produce noninflationary growth. 1 have called this circular rela-
tionship Reagan's Imperial Circle because it finances a strong mil-
I itary posture by attracting both goods and capital from abroad.
This makes the circle benign at the center and vicious at the
periphery.
It can be seen that the Imperial Circle was built on an internal
contradiction between monetarism and supply-side economics.
The outcome was not intended or even anticipated. Many mo-
- mentous historical developments occur without the participants
fully realizing what is happening. The tremendous transfer of
resources to less developed countries that occurred between 1974
and 1982 could not have taken place in a planned and organized
manner, and, as we have seen, the Collective system of lending
came into existence unintended and unannounced.
Most professional economists did not consider the emergence
or the survival of a benign circle possible, but President Reagan,
despite his intellectual limitations, seems to have had a better
understanding of what was possible than did his economic advis-
ers. After all, the reflexive process of the Imperial Circle fitted
well with his concept of leadership-which is, of course, a reflex-
ive concept par excellence. He was therefore content to pay lip
service to the desirability of balancing the budget, ignored and
eventually got rid of Martin Feldstein, and left the deficit well
enough alone. Europeans complained about the strong dollar-
although it is not quite clear why-but the U.S. administration
insisted on a policy of benign neglect.
A benign circle for the United States is a vicious circle for the
debtor nations. The trade deficit of the United States is mirrored
by trade surpluses in other countries. To the extent that a strong
export performance has enabled heavily indebted countries to

become current on their interest payments, the effect may be
judged beneficial; but, even here, the benefit accrues to the lend-
ers. For the rest, the debtor nations have been laboring under high
real interest rates and very unfavorable terms of trade. Dollars are
cheap when they are boyowed, but expensive when the interest
has to be paid. The scramble to export depresses the prices of the
commodities exported. qlthough the external performance of the
debtor countries has exceeded most expectations, the internal
performance is much less satisfactory. There are some that have
shown practically no recovery, and even among the more success-
ful ones per capita income has been lagging; now that it has begun
to rise the trade surplus1i s beginning to deteriorate. Somr: of tht?
weakest countries have endured a downward spiral in which both
their domestic economies and their abilities to service their debts
have deteriorated to the vanishing point. This group comprises a
large part of Africa and some Latin American and Caribbean
countries like Peru and the Dominican Republic.
As far as the more dgveloped countries are concerned, rising
exports to the United States have had a stimulating effect but the
response has been very subdued. Corporations have been reluc-
tant to add to capacity because they are afraid, and justifiably so,
that the dollar will decline just when their capacity comes on
stream. By contrast, holding financial assets in dollars exerts an
almost irresistible attraction. The phenomenon is particularly no-
ticeable in Britain, where currency swings have becpn especially
wild. The whole of Europe has been languishing with high un-
employment and little growth, and it has become fashionable to
speak of "Eurosclerosis." The Far East has shown much greater
dynamism under the impetus of the newly industrialized cmrr-
tries and the opening up of China. Japan has been the greatest
beneficiary of the present state of affairs. Its position is almost the
mirror image of that of the United States, with a large export
surplus and strongdomestic savings counterbalanced by the ex-
port of capital.
Let us try to analyze Reagan's Imperial Circle with the help of
the analytical tools we have developed so far. We shall use the
notation adopted in Chapter 3. The four key elements are a strong
t t
economy ( v), a strong currency ( e), a growing budget deficit
( 3. B), and a growing trade deficit ( 3. 7'). At first sight, there are
some obvious contradictions between these four variables. Con-
ventional economics tells us that a growing trade deficit ( 3. T)

tends to depress both the exchange rate ( J. e) and the level of
domestic activity ( J. v):
But the Imperial Circle managed to overcome these causal rela-
tionships with the help of two other variables: the budget deficit
and capital inflows.
The economy strengthened because the stimulus of the budget
deficit outweighed the drag of the trade deficit. Economic activity
is, of course, influenced by many other factors. To bring them all
into the picture would complicate the argument unduly. What
matters is the end result: a strong economy. To keep the picture
simple, we shall denote the net effect of all other factors with a
question mark (?), giving us the formula
Similarly, the dollar appreciated because capital inflows-
+
J. (N S)-exceeded the trade deficit:
These two relationships are the mainstays of the Imperial Circle.
There are many other relationships at work, so many that it
would be onerous to list them all. Some reinforce the Imperial
Circle; others work against it; yet others reinforce it in the short
run but cannot be sustained in the long run. The most important
self-reinforcing connection is between the exchange rate and
speculative capital inflows:
We have already identified two connections that work against the
Imperial Circle (Equation I), and here we can mention two con-
nections that are self-reinforcing in the short run, but unsustain-
able in the long run. First, while speculative capital inflows are

self-reinforcing in the short run, they also generate interest and
repayment obligations that are cumulative and work in the oppo-
site direction.
Eventually the growing debt service ( N) is bound to undermine
the relationship on which the Imperial Circle rests and the trend
of the exchange rate is going to be reversed:
At that time, debt service and the flight of speculative capital may
combine with the trade' deficit to generate a catastrophic collapse
of the dollar: central bank officials, Volcker foremost among them,
are aware of the danger and are publicly warning against it.2 To
put matters in perspective, it should be pointed out that it would
take many years for interest charges to accumulate to a point
where they would reverse the balance. The likelihood is that the
Imperial Circle will be reversed or at least brought to a halt long
before that. Volcker and other responsible government officials
are certainly working %o\vard& at end.
The crucial question confronting the world is whether the Im-
perial Circle can be arrested without precipitating a catastrophic
collapse of the dollar. The longer it lasts, and the higher the dollar
climbs, the greater the danger of a fall. The problem is that a clear-
cut reversal in the trend of the dollar could, even at this stage,
cause a shift not oqy in the ongoing flow of investment but also
in the accumulated stock of speculative capital. The stock is, of
course, many times larger than the ongoing flow. The problem is
widely recognized, making the holders of dollar assets very ner-
vous. That is why foreign holdings of marketable assets are aptly
described as "hot money."
The second example is the budget deficit, which is stimulative
+.

in the short run but may be counterproductive in the long run
I because it diverts resources from more productive uses through
the interest rate mechanism:
As long as high interest rates suck in capital from abroad, the
4
problem remains latent. With the help of foreign savings, the do-
mestic economy can consume more than it produces. Only when
the capital inflow ceases to match the budget deficit does the
problem become acute. Interest rates must rise in order to generate
the domestic savings necessary to finance the budget deficit. The
consequent decline in consumption depresses the economy, mak-
ing foreigners all the less willing to hold dollar assets. This may
give rise to a "disaster scenario" in which a weak economy and a
large budget deficit combine to produce high interest rates and a
weak dollar.
We can combine these relationships to create an integrated
model of the Imperial Circle:

In this model, one of the mainstays of the Imperial Circle, Equa-
tion 2, is shown horizontally and the other, Equation 3, vertically.
It will be seen that the model is not stable: some connections
reinforce it while others undermine it. The factors best reinforced
are the speculative inflows and the trade deficit; the factor most
endangered is the level 'of economic activity. The main threats to
the stability of the Imperial Circle come from the trade deficit and
the budget deficit. The thin pillars of the arrangement are a strong
dollar and a strong economy; but a strong dollar leads to a rising
trade deficit that weakens the economy and the budget deficit
keeps interest rates higher than they would be otherwise, which
also weakens the ecacorny, These are the internal inconsistencies
that are likely to destroy the Imperial Circle long before the accu-
mulation of debt service obligations would do so.
N dless to say, the model is incomplete. There are many con-
necTns that are not 'shown; the illustration is complicated
enough as it is. Perhaps some connection that has been ignored
here will come to the rescue of the Imperial Circle when the need
arises. We have already witnessed such occasions. For instance,
until the middle of 1984, banks were active in expanding credit
at home and attracting funds from abroad. When they stopped
functioning as the main conduit, for reasons that will be ex-
plained in Chapter 8, the Treasury took their place: the withhold-
ing tax was abolished, and a large portion of the government debt
was sold directly to foreigners.

It would be interesting to construct a more complete model and
endow the variables with numerical values. I believe it would be
possible to simulate the evolution of the U.S. economy since
1982, but I am not equipped to carry out wch an operation. I have
to confine myself to an impressionistic presentation.
We are dealing with a system that is not stable, but constantly
evolving. What will succeed the Imperial Circle? That is the ques-
tion that needs to be answered. Before I attempt to do so, let me
complete the picture by taking a closer look at the banking system
and the corporate restructuring that is currently sweeping the
country.

EVOLUTION OF THE BANKING SYSTEM
It is generally recognized that the international debt crisis of 1982
constituted a dramatic point for the debtor countries. The direc-
tion of resource transfers was reversed and the magnitude of the
swing was limited only by the debtor countries' capacities to pay.
In our model of the Imperial Circle the swing shows up as a
nonspeculative inflow ( N) because it is guided by considera-
tions other than total return. The amounts involved are signifi-
cant: net resource transfers to heavily indebted countries swing
from $50.1 billion in 1982 to a reverse flow of $13.8 billion in
1983,' most of it in dollar form. Resource transfers from the heav-
ily indebted countries have provided one of the major underpin-
nings for the Imperial Circle.
It is less well recognized that the crisis of 1982 did not bring a
similar turning point for the banking system. The largest banks
were too deeply involved to allow them to reverse direction. Had
they stopped lending altogether, the heavily indebted countries
would have had to default. Had they tried to set up adequate
reserves, their capital position would have been impaired. It was
to preserve these banks that the Collectives were established. We
have dealt with the role of the Collectives in tiding over the debtor
countries; now we must examine what happened to the banking
system.
The Collective system of lending operates on the principle of
voluntary cooperation. The regulatory authorities had to exert
themselves to make it possible for the heavily involved banks to
extend new loans and to induce less involved banks to cooperate.

Evolution of the Banking System 119
The only way they could achieve these objectives was by main-
taining the fiction tha't the outstanding loans were unimpaired
and no special reserves had to be set up against them. There was
some divergence of opinion among the various supervisory agen-
cies but the Federal Reserve, as lender of last resort, maintained
the upper hand. The banking system was considered too weak to
be given any strong medicine. Accounting standards were modi-
fied and special effortd were made to enable banks to meet them.
The last-minute bridge loan to Argentina on March 1, 1984,
stands out as the most dramatic intervention by the Federal Re-
serve.
Eurcpean central banks took e different tesk. They encowaged
commercial banks to set up reserves and write down bad loans.
They could afford to do so. European banks were, on the whole,
less deeply involved, and their accounting system permitted the
accumulation of large hidden reserves. The United Kingdom oc-
cupied a halfway position between the Continent and the United
States. Some British banks were amongst those with the highest
loan exposure to less developed countries, but they had a much
sounder deposit base%inth eir own branch system so that they
were never as susceptible to a crisis of confidence as their Amer-
ican counterparts.
It may be argued that the Federal Reserve went too far in sup-
porting the money center banks. These banks were allowed to
treat as current income the rescheduling fees anbxceptionally
wide spreads they charged on paper but did not collect in cash.
As a result, they could report substantial earnings gains, and some
of them actually increased their dividends in 1983.
Ironically, the formation of the Collectives, and the permissilre
attitude of the regulatory authorities that accompanied it, delayed
and diverted the adjustment process in the U.S. banking industry.
Debtor countries had to face harsh reality, but banks were left
with a large load of doubtful debt whose doubtful quality they
had to hide. The ~ n lwya y they could collect the interest was by
making additional loans. Thus the problem was not only unac-
knowledged but also growing, The banks responded by trying
to grow even fast&. The most desirable way to grow was to pro-
vide services without tying up assets. Money center banks devel-
oped a host of new services and marketed them aggressively.
But they were not averse to expanding their balance sheets,
either. Almost any loan was of better quality than their portfolio

of loans to the less developed countries. This was the heyday of
leveraged buyouts; banks were willing to grant very generous
terms. Banks were also aggressive bidders for deposits abroad
and used the funds to build up their domestic asset base. Thus
they became the primary vehicle for attracting capital to the
United States.
Unfortunately, banks were unable to use their remarkably good
reported earnings to raise equity capital, because the stock market
saw through the charade and bank shares were valued at substan-
tial discounts from stated asset values. Chemical Bank managed
to seize a propitious moment and sell some shares; Manufacturers
Hansver alss placed shares in connection wi4& its acquisition ui
CIT Corp.-but these were exceptions. On the whole, banks had
to rely on retained earnings, which could not keep pace with the
I
growth in assets.
Nevertheless, there was a race to expand and diversify. Manu-
facturers Hanover acquired CIT Corp. at a hefty price and the
artifice of the "nonbank bank" was invented in order to circum-
vent existing restrictions on geographical diversification. The
money center banks were pressing for permission to expand
across state lines, but they ran into stiff opposition from regional
banks who wanted protection. The protracted battle has only re-
cently been resolved, giving the regional banks a breathing space
before the money center banks are allowed to buy up banks out-
side state limits.
The Federal Reserve did not wish to put any constraints on the
banking system that would have a negative effect on the economy.
The first priority was to prevent a collapse and to that end they
wanted to engineer a strong recovery. Only when the recovery
was well under way did they rein in the money supply, allowing
interest rates to rise. They could have also tried to rein in the
banks, but that is not what happened. Bad loans continued to
accumulate and capital ratios continued to deteriorate. Confi-
dence in the banking system remained precarious.
Eventually troubles surfaced in the domestic loan portfolios.
Large segments of the economy, notably agriculture and the oil
industry, did not participate in the recovery. In contrast to the
international debt, it was impractical to keep the domestic bor-
rowers afloat by lending them the money to pay the interest be-
cause there were just too many of them. Continental Illinois Bank
was particularly badly hit because it had followed loose lending

practices. Specifically, it had purchased a large amount of un-
sound energy loans from Penn Square Bank, which had gone
bankrupt. Having no branches, it was in the unfortunate position
of being heavily dependent on borrowed funds. Thus it became
the focal point of concern.
There was also troubte brewing in the savings and loan indus-
try. The equity of many institutions had been wiped out by the
rise in interest rates pridr to 1982. To prevent wholesale collapse,
a large number of institutions had to be merged or otherwise sal-
vaged during 1982. The Reagan administration was looking to the
market mechanism for a solution. In one of the most remarkable
episodes in financial history many of the mgnlatory constraints
were removed just at a time when the capital of the industry
was seriously impaired. The range of activities in which savings
and loan companies could engage and the range of assets they
could invest in were greatly extended. Since the savings and
loans had gotten into trouble in a regulated environment it
was assumed that the, removal of constraints would help to
get them out of trouble. Private enterprise did in fact devise
ingenious ways to salvage bankrupt savings and loan com-
panies. Most of the new money invested was immediately re-
couped as a tax loss and sawy investors gained control of
institutions licensed to gather government-insured deposits
with very little cash investment. Some of these institutions
fell into the hands of operators who could use su& deposits in
support of other activities from which they profited. They had
much to gain but little to lose from expanding aggressively.
This was a formula for disaster. It is surprising that it was not
recognized as such.
The company that exploited the opportunity presented by the
regulators most aggressively was Financial Corporation of Amer-
ica under the dynamic leadership of its president, Charles Knapp.
Having acquired First Charter Financial, an old established insti-
tution whose deposits were insured by the Federal Savings and
Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), it went on a borrowing
spree, using brokgrs as well as a high-powered in-house sales
force. It then invested heavily in rather risky real estate loans as
well as fixed-rate mbrtgages. If any of the loans went sour, another
developer was found who would take it over in exchange for a
much larger loan on his own development. As interest rates began
to rise, the company averaged up its fixed-rate mortgage portfolio

at an exponential rate. Knapp figured that in this way he would
have a high-yielding portfolio when interest rates finally declined
and if he grew large enough he could not be allowed to go broke
even if interest rates did not decline: heads he would win, tails
he could not lose. The calculation was correct. The company grew
from $4.9 billion in deposits in 1982 to $20.3 billion in 1984. As
the financial position of the company deteriorated, Knapp was
forced out (after receiving severance pay in seven figures) but the
company was resc~ed.~
The crisis in Continental Illinois Corp. and Financial Corpora-
tion of America came to a head more or less concurrently in the
=mmer of 1984. That was the true turning point fw Liul'king
and thrift industries, although this fact is still not properly appre-
ciated. Bank examiners remembered their statutory duty and
I
began to take a stand on bad loans. Regulators tightened capital
requirements, and insisted on strengthening bad debt reserves.
Banks responded by shrinking their balance sheets, selling off
assets, and packaging loans for resale rather than putting them on
the books. The period of unsound growth came to an end and the
adjustment process finally began.
At first blush, the adjustment has been remarkably smooth.
Banks became adept at packaging loans for resale, developing a
variety of financial instruments ranging from floating rate notes to
mortgage pass-through certificates. Whenever necessary, other in-
stitutions have taken over the banks' role. Junk bonds have re-
placed bank loans in financing mergermania, and Treasury bonds
have taken the place of Eurodollar deposits in sucking in capital
from abroad. It is no coincidence that the withholding tax on
foreign-owned bonds was removed just as the turning point in
bank expansion was reached.
With every passing quarter, the financial position of the banks
ought to improve. Individual banks may be hurt when they have
to recognize losses but the industry as a whole ought to become
sounder. The stock market responded positively to the changed
outlook: bank shares rose to levels where they were selling at
premiums over book value.
But the period of danger is not yet over. It is after a trend has
been reversed that the full effect of the preceding excesses is felt.
While banks were given leeway, they could cover up their bad
loans by extending additional credit. But when banks are required
to set up reserves against bad or doubtful loans it does not pay

them to throw good money after bad. On the contrary, they have
every reason to liquidate bad loans, because by doing so they can
convert non-earning assets into earning assets and they may also
be able to recapture some of the reserves they have been obliged
to set up. The danger is that the liquidation of bad loans uncovers
other bad loans. For instance, there were many farmers who could
not service their debt but the value of their land was still high
enough to provide adequate collateral: these farmers were given
additional credit rather than forced into bankruptcy. But the liq-
uidation of bankrupt farmers is depressing land prices, so that
additional farmers are forced into bankruptcy. The same is hap-
pening in the oil industry, and at the time of this writing (Septem-
ber 1985) ominous signs are emerging in real estate. shipping is
probably next in line.
The bankruptcy of Community Savings Bank of Maryland and
its subsidiary, Equity Programs, Inc. (EPIC), in 1985 serves as a
paradigm of what happens when the trend is reversed. The insti-
tution in question had been acquired by real estate developers
who carried on their syndicating activities as a subsidiary of the
thrift institution. They specialized in financing model homes and
enjoyed a good reputation. The mortgages on these homes were
insured by private mortgage insurance companies and sold to
investors in the form of mortgage-backed securities. Following a
run on state-insured savings banks in Ohio, savings banks in
Maryland were required to seek federal insurance. The Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, in its chdened mood,
insisted that the real estate syndicating subsidiary should be
sold before the parent was granted FSLIC cover. That caused the
whole situation to unravel. The subsidiary coiild not syndicate
any new loans, and without new syndicaiions it could not ser-
vice its outstanding mortgages. It turned out that the income
from the already syndicated homes had been insufficient to cover
the mortgages and the deficiency had been habitually made up
from new syndications. In theory, the model homes would even-
tually be sold and would start to produce income, but, in practice,
the subsidiary had become heavily indebted to the parent and
it appears that some of the model homes did not even exist. The
subsidiary had issued about $1.4 billion of mortgage-backed se-
curities and the ,moFgage insurance companies were on the hook.
The potential liability exceeded the assets of some of the insur-
ance companies in question, and if they cannot meet their obli-

gations the security of mortgage-backed securities may be

endangered. *
My brief account of recent events is sufficient to show that
regulators are not exempt from bias. They are participants in a
reflexive process and operate on the basis of imperfect under-
standing, just like those whom they regulate. On balance the reg-
ulators understand the business they supervise less well than
those who engage in it. The more complex and innovative that
business is, the less likely that the supervisory authority can do a
competent job.
Regulation always lags behind events. By the time regulators
have caught up with excesses, the corrective action they insist on.
tends to exacerbate the situation in the opposite direction. That is
what has happened in the period under study. By the time the
4 authorities discovered that international lending was unsound it
was too late to correct the situation because the correction would
have precipitated a collapse. When they finally insisted that
banks recognize their losses, their insistence reinforced the col-
lapse of collateral values in areas such as agriculture, the oil in-
dustry, and shipping.
Commercial bankers have also committed many mistakes, but
at least they have an excuse: they operate within guidelines laid
down by the regulators. Their job is to compete, not to worry
about the soundness of the system. Their excuse is valid in the
sense that, as long as there is no fraud involved, the authorities
will, in fact, bail them out if they get into difficulties. This com-
pounds the responsibility that regulators have to shoulder.
The authorities have given a good account of themselves when-
ever the situation has deteriorated to the crisis point. To sane
extent, this is due to the merit of the individuals involved. Events
might have taken a different course if it had not been Volcker who
was in charge of the Federal Reserve. He displayed a positive
eagerness in confronting difficult situations and coming up with
innovative solutions that is rare in a bureaucrat. But there is also
an institutional reason. Central banks are given a mandate to act
as lenders of last resort. They have incomparably more authority
in an emergency than in the ordinary course of events. They are

surance Company, went out of business, but the mortgage-backed securities

geared to crisis management and quite incompetent when it
comes to problem solvihg. To achieve any lasting solutions, the
whole machinery of the administration and Congress needs to be
involved. That means that needed reforms are rarely enacted in
time.
The banking crisis of '1984 has left us with an unresolved di-
lemma. There is a basic imbalance in deregulating deposit-taking
institutions and guaranteeing depositors against loss. The guar-
antee enables financial institutions to attract additional deposits
at will, and deregulation gives them wide latitude in putting those
deposits to use. The combination of the two is an invitation to
unrestrained credit expansi-on The problem has been inherent in
the system of Federal deposit insurance since its inception but at
the time the FDIC was founded banks were strictly regulated. The
imbalance between risk and reward became more pronounced as
the trend toward deregulation gained momentum, and it reached
a critical point in the crisis of 1984.
The Federal Reserve was forced to expand its role as lender of
last resort and guaranteb all depositors against loss whatever the
size of their deposits. This removed the last vestige of the disci-
pline that depositors are supposed to impose on banks. In the
absence of that discipline there is nothing left but the regulatory
authorities to stop financial institutions from engaging in un-
sound lending practices.
It may be argued that shareholders would act as asonstraining
influence because they remain at risk, but the constraint is not
very effective since a bank can cover up its losses by lending even
more. By the time the losses can no longer be hidden, much more
will have been lost than the equity capital. Thus, hil~ringe quity
and loan capital at risk is not sufficient to ensure sound lending
practices.
The regulatory authorities have, in fact, become much stricter
since 1984. Yet the popular and political bias in favor of deregu-
lation is as strong as ever. The geographic and functional restric-
tions imposed in the Great Depression are in the process of being
dismantled. Theoretically, there need be no conflict between de-
regulation and stricter supervision; but in practice there is. As we
have seen, regulators make mistakes; the more varied and change-
able the business, the less likely that it will be adequately super-
vised. There is a strong prima facie case for keeping the deposit-
taking business as simple as possible. On the other hand, simple,

regulated businesses tend to breed stodgy, conservative manage-
ments. It boils down to a choice between stability and innovation.
When one of these ingredients is missing its absence is sorely felt.
As a consequence, preferences tend to swing from one extreme to
another. At present we are still elated by the opportunities that
have been opened up by the removal of outdated regulations; but
the need for stability is increasingly pressing.
There is another simmering problem that is approaching boil-
ing point. It concerns the treatment of insolvent financial institu-
tions. Traditionally, the authorities prefer to arrange the
acquisition of failing institutions by larger, sounder ones. Such
forced mergers used to offer an easy way out when the industry
was tightly regulated, failures were few and far between, and the
acquiring institutions were financially strong. The failing bank
4 had a valuable franchise that could be auctioned off to the highest
bidder without endangering the structure of the industry. But as
the process of credit expansion and deregulation progressed, the
procedure of "merging out" insolvent units became both more
frequent and less satisfactory. The franchises became less valu-
able and the acquiring institutions less able to withstand a dilu-
tion of their financial strength. A concentrated industry is
seemingly stronger. For instance, the clearing banks of the United
Kingdom have never had any difficulty in attracting deposits, al-
though Midland Bank, for one, was in worse shape than any of
the surviving banks in the United States. But increasing concen-
tration increases the danger of catastrophic losses. What would
happen to the United Kingdom if the clearing banks were unable
to collect the interest on their loans to less developed countries?
Closer to home, Bank cf America was encouraged to acquire First
of Seattle; but who is going to acquire Bank of America if the need
arises? * We have already had the first instance, that of Continen-
tal Illinois Bank, where no buyer could be found. We may yet
arrive at a point where several of our largest banks end up as
public property. It has happened in other countries.
In no instance was the idea of merging out sick units so ill
conceived as in the savings and loan industry. As we have seen,
* To my great surprise, as of December 1986, First Interstate is avidly pursuing
BankAmerica, Chemical Bank is buying Texas Commerce Bank, and
RepublicBank is willing to take over one of the weakest banks in Texas, Inter-
first, in order to prevent out-of-state competitors from gaining a foothold in the
state.

much of the industry became insolvent during the 1980-82 pe-
riod of record high interest rates. The authorities devised the bril-
liant scheme of selling off ailing units to adventurous
entrepreneurs who appreciated the privilege of being able to at-
tract federally issued aeposits. We have seen how entrepreneurs
like Charles W. Knapp of the Financial Corporation of America
exploited the privilege. Now that the regulators have put a stop to
uncontrolled expansibn, many of the excesses are beginning to
surface. Only the decline in interest rates has saved us from an
avalanche of insolvencies.

THE: "OLIGOPO~ATION"O F
AMERICA *
Within the context of Reagan's Imperial Circle there is another
important reflexive development under way: the corporate struc-
ture of the United States is being reshaped by means of mergers,
acquisitions, divestitures, and leveraged buyouts. The move has
the dramatic quality usually associated with reflexive processes
and it has reached proportions that endow it with historical sig-
nificance. Its roots go back to well before the inception of the
Imperial Circle but it has .gained tremendous momentum since
1982. The process of corporate restructuring is clearly interrelated
with the Imperial Circle but so far the relationship is rather lop-
sided: prevailing economic and political conditions provide the
context in which the restructuring occurs but the evolution of the
Imperial Circle has not been significantly affected by corporate
restructuring. The process that can be loosely described as mer-
germania is therefore best regarded as a sideshow rather than an
essential ingredient of the Imperial Circle.
In its impact on the corporate structure of the United States,
mergermania has already exceeded the conglomerate boom. Con-
glomerates started out as relatively small companies that became
large through acquisitions; mergermania has involved the largest
entities in corporate America. There are many similarities be-
tween the two developments but the differences are more pro-
* This chapter has been kept as it was originally written in June 1985, with a
brief postscript added in December 1986.

nounced. If the conglomerate boom represents the simplest case
of an initially self-reinforcing and eventually self-defeating pro-
cess, mergermania is perhaps the most complex. The conglomer-
ates provided a paradigm of boom and bust; mergermania
exemplifies a reflexive process in which the self-reinforcing and
self-defeating interactiohs are not sequential but simultaneous.
I shall not attempt a descriptive history of mergermania. I shall
simply assume that the, reader is more or less familiar with the
discrete corporate events that have occurred in the last few years.
My own familiarity with mergermania is not much greater than
that of a well-informed,m ember of the public because I did not
participate in it in a professional capacity.
Corporate events have been occurring continuously ever since
there have been organized stock markets. Whenever the market
value of the shares is higher than the value of a company as a
privately owned entity1 the corporate event consists of a sale of
shares; whenever the market value is lower, a purchase of shares
is involved. The purchaser may be the company itself, the man-
agement, an outside group, or another company that may have a
special reason for putting a high value on the shares.
The conglomerate boom combined the buying and selling of
shares. Conglomerates were selling their own shares at inflated
prices and buying the shares of other companies. They could put
a higher value on the shares of other companies than the market
because the acquisitions helped to support the ov~rvaluationo f
their own shares. Thus the conglomerate boom was essentially a
phenomenon of overvaluation with inflated securities serving as
the means of exchange.
By contrast, in the current process of corporate restructuring
the primary means of exchange is cash. The cash may be bor-
rowed in a number of ways, but the final result is the same: shares
are bought for cash. There are occasional mergers that are accom-
plished by an exchange of shares but they are not characteristic of
the trend. There are also many developments, notably the dispo-
sition of assets and operating divisions, that do not involve the
purchase or sale of shares at all; yet the event that characterizes
the current process and qualifies it as a reflexive one is the pur-
chase of shares for cash. Thus mergermania is predicated on the

substantially more than the market capitalization of its shares.

shock when a concerted effort was made to bring inflation under
t control through stringent monetary policy. It was greatly rein-
forced after Reagan became president and the Imperial Circle
evolved.
We can discern three factors in the relative undervaluation of
shares: economic, political, and tax related. The first two are def-
initely interconnected with Reagan's Imperial Circle; the third is
due to the peculiarity of our tax system. I shall emphasize it be-
cause it provides that element of distortion that seems to be an
essential ingredient in reflexive processes.
As long as interest expense is tax deductible, it pays to acquire
companies with borrowed cash, became there is a savicg on taxss.
That is one of the major motivations in leveraged buyouts. There
are many other, more arcane, tax benefits involved, but this is not
I
the place to explore them.*
Shares traditionally have been valued as a multiple of earnings.
When the rate of interest is high, the multiple tends to be low.
But earnings are only a part of pretax cash flow, often a minor
part. Yet, it is cash flow that is the primary criterion in determin-
ing the value of a business as a candidate for acquisition. Thus
the traditional method of valuing shares has helped to create op-
portunities for acquisition, especially in periods, such as the Im-
perial Circle, when earnings are depressed and interest rates
relatively high.
Let us take a profitable but mature company with little scope
for expansion-a so-called cash cow. If it is acquired with bor-
rowed funds, the interest can be paid out of pretax earnings. To
the extent that the market discounts pretax earnings at a rate
higher khan the prevailing interest rate, t h e i s a margin of eai-
ings, in addition to the free-cash flow, that can be used to pay
down the loan. Eventually, the acquirer is left with a debt-free
company. As that point approaches he could, in theory, sell the
shares to the public, realizing a capital gain. He could then turn
around and buy back the shares from the public and start the
process all over again. In practice, several of the early leveraged
buyouts have resurfaced as new issues. I do not know of any
* Several of them, notably the so-called General Utilities doctrine, which allows
the acquiring company to write up assets and depreciate them from a higher
base, have been eliminated in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The tax deductibility
of interest has not been changed, but the corporate tax rate has been lowered
from 48% to 34%, thereby reducing the tax benefit of using borrowed money.

instances where a refloated company has gone private again, but I
know of cases where previous leveraged buyouts have been relev-
eraged in private transactions.
It can be seen that the tax system has made cash cows particu-
larly susceptible to leveraged buyouts, while the Imperial Circle
has had the unintended consequence of turning companies into
cash cows. The mechhism by which the effect is achieved is high
real interest rates and an overvalued currency. High real interest
rates render financial assets more attractive, and physical invest-
ments less attractive; thus they provide an incentive not to put
cash to work in expanding the business but rather to use it as a
financial asset: buying in shares or acquiring other companies. An
overvalued currency tends to render industrial activity less prof-
itable: export markets shrink and domestic markets come under
price pressure from irqports.
The combination of high real interest rates and an overvalued
currency proved to be a potent brew. The producers of tradable
goods have been put under great strain; often their survival is at
stake. They have reacted by consolidating: shedding unprofitable
divisions, abandoning activities where their market position is
weak, and concentrating on those areas where their position is
worth defending. Traditional attitudes have been shaken up;
often there has been a change in management. Gone are the days
when corporations pursued growth for its own sake; free cash
flow and profits have assumed an importance VmPiich they had
previously enjoyed only in textbooks. Managements have started
to look at their businesses more like an investment fund manager
looks at his portfolio. This has created a suitable atmosphere for
corporate restructuring.
Every time an acquisition occurs, it tends to narrow the gap
between market prices and the value to the acquirer. This brings
us to the most curious feature of the process. One would expect
that the acquisitions of shares for cash would reduce the extent of
undervaluation to a point where acquisitions are no longer prof-
itable and the movement comes to a stop. Why has the gap not
been closed? To answer this question, we must invoke a political
factor. The Reagan administration believes in the magic of the
marketplace. This finds expression, first of all, in the deregulation
of regulated industries, but it also permeates the government's
attitude toward corporate activity in general.
There has been no formal reform of antitrust laws but there has

been a radical shift in what is considered an antitrust violation.
I
Market share is no longer viewed in a static but in a dynamic
context. Competition need not be preserved within a given indus-
try because companies can compete with each other across indus-
try lines. Bottles compete with cans, plastic competes with glass,
aluminum with steel. Technological advances can open up ave-
nues of competition that did not exist previously. Long-distance
telephone service is the best example: what had been considered
a natural monopoly has become a highly competitive market.
Moreover, the U.S. market is no longer viewed in isolation: inter-
national competition protects the interests of the consumer, es-
pecially when the dollar is so strong, and the national interest
dictates the consolidation of *U.S. producers into fewer and
+
stronger units. Whether these considerations will remain as valid
in the future as they seem at present is open to question; but,
while they prevail, large-scale combinations do not face the polit-
ical obstacles they would have encountered in previous adminis-
trations. I call the process the "oligopolarization~o' f America.
Under the Carter administration any large-scale acquisition,
like the purchase of Utah International by General Electric, pro-
voked an antitrust investigation that slowed down the transaction
even if it did not abort it. It was generally believed that companies
above a certain size were both immune from attack and disquali-
fied from making significant corporate moves. They lived in a sort
of suspended animation with managements safely ensconced and
,
confined to operating their existing businesses. Since this view
was rarely challenged, it was not corroborated by evidence but
prevailed in the form of a bias. The bias found expressinn in stack
valuations. Smaller companies were perceived as having greater
exposure to corporate activity and in consequence tended to be
more highly priced. Between 1974 and 1979 the shares of small
companies outperformed large ones by a considerable margin,
and investors specializing in small capitalization stocks enjoyed
a field day. Corporate activity, such as leveraged buyouts, was in
fact concentrated in that sector.
After 1980 there was a gradual but perceptible shift. The size of
deals increased and industries once considered immune became
susceptible to attack. For instance, a few years ago beleaguered
companies used to acquire radio or TV stations as a way of de-
fending themselves; now the industry is up for grabs. Both ABC
and RCA (which owns NBC) were taken over in friendly deals
and CBS, under attack, gained a new controlling shareholder.

The trend was not qecognized at first, but as it spread from
industry to industry it captured the imagination of investors and
it is now fully reflected in share valuations. Since 1980, relative
performance has shifted back in favor of large capitalization
stocks, and mergermaqia has undoubtedly played a part in the
move. As the process continues, a point will be reached when
expectations exceed re+lity and the stock prices of the candidates
will hamper the conclusion of deals. The spread between pre-deal
prices and the pdees actually paid has already narrowed but the
pace of transactions has not yet slackened. Mergermania has gen-
erated a momentum of its own and undoubtedly there will be
'some deals concluded 'at unreasonable prices before the process
exhausts itself.
Looking at mergermania analytically, we may classify the re-
flexive interaction as primarily self-defeating or self-correcting. If
there is a self-reinforcing connection, it is lateral rather than ver-
tical: it expands the number and size of companies affected rather
than raising stock valses to unsustainable heights. There is rela-
tively little vertical or price action. Successful acquirers, such as
GAF Corp., attain higher stock prices and, if they can successfully
recapitalize themselves, they can swallow another company. If
the process lasts long%e nough, favorites will emerge with pre-
mium valuations that will make it easier for them to fulfill expec-
tations. Mesa Petroleum was in the process of emerging as such a
premium company until Unocal stopped it in its..tlfacks. On the
other hand, Esmark has gone full circle, first acquiring and then
being acquired.
The self-reinforcing connection comes at first from the elimi-
nation of a negative bias. What has been done with one company
can be done with another and, encouraged by success, people
attempt what had not been thought possible before. Eventually
excesses are bound to develop. In order to get a better insight we
must take a closer look at the players. First, there are the merger
and acquisition departments that engineer the corporate transac-
tions; then there are the lawyers who dream up new attacks and
new defenses; the actual acquirers; the providers of credit; and
the arbitrage traders who hold the stocks before and during deals
and often become active participants; finally, there are the regu-
lators who are supposed to supervise the process. All the partici-
pants, with the exception of the regulators, stand to earn very
large profits from successful transactions.
Excessive profits often lead to other excesses, especially when

credit is involved. There is not much point in listing them in a
I
general way. Each transaction is high drama and drama is con-
structed out of human foibles. A narrative of specific events
would recount many mistakes, exaggerations, abuses, as well as
some bold maneuvers and brilliant inventions. In this respect,
mergermania does not differ from other activities that generate
windfall profits. There is a general predilection to pursue such
activities until some failures exert a discouraging effect. When
credit is used on a large scale, failures can mdwball. We have
already had at least one occasion when a large arbitrage trader,
Ivan Boesky, was forced to liquidate his positions, forcing some
others to do iikewise. There has also been much concern about
the debt accumulated in leveraged buyouts. Until recently most
I of the credit came from banks. As we have seen, they were trying
to grow their way out of their difficulties after the international
debt crisis, and leveraged buyouts provided a ready market. But
the regulatory authorities started to discourage bank lending for
leveraged buyouts even before the twin crises of the Continental
Illinois Bank and the Financial Corporation of America. For a
time it looked like financing would dry up, and the pace of cor-
porate activity did slow down. That was in the second half of
1984 just after some large oil companies had been gobbled up; the
elections were approaching and it was felt that additional take-
overs might be politically embarrassing. Mergermania resumed
with renewed vigor after the elections but the main source of
financing shifted from banks to junk bonds. The shift was proba- '
bly dictated by necessity-Unocal sued Security Pacific Bank for
providing credit to a corporate enemy-but it turned out t~ be a
technical improvement. Junk bonds are more flexible and more
easily arranged; they also offer some wrinkles that can be ex-
ploited for tax purposes. Drexel Burnham, the dominant force in
junk bond financing, can provide almost unlimited funds at short
notice.
Will it all come to a bad end? That is impossible to predict. As
we have seen, the main reflexive connection is a self-correcting
one. The boomhust model we have developed for conglomerates
is not applicable. It is quite likely that the process will burn itself
out after it has swept all the ground that is susceptible to it. But a
disaster cannot be ruled out. The net effect is to introduce a great
deal of debt into the restructured companies. A number of differ-
ent scenarios could lead to situations where the debt is difficult

to service. If the Impe~iaCl ircle is reversed and the dollar falls
just as the economy slips into recession, interest rates may also
rise at the same time and highly leveraged companies would con-
front the worst of all ,possible worlds. In the more immediate
future, a precipitous f?ll in oil prices could endanger the cash
flow of heavily indebted oil companies like Phillips Petroleum.
One major default mi@ unravel the magic circle of junk bond
holders.
Up till now, mergermania has not had a detectable influence on
the fate of the Imperial Circle. It has probably reduced physical
investment activity in the United States by making managements
more oriented isward 'the short term, but investment remained
surprisingly strong until recently. Mergermania has probably con-
tributed to credit demands and induced banks to borrow abroad
in order to lend at home; but when the role of the banks dimin-
ished, the influx of capital from abroad continued. If there is a
reflexive connection, it*is too subtle to be readily discerned: it has
to do with the generaliattraction the United States holds for for-
eign capital at the present time.
Another, more ominous, connection is beginning to surface. A
great deal of credit is employed in the acquisition of companies;
the credit is then repaid by disposing of the assets that served as
collateral. Both activities, the nonproductive use of credit and the
sale of collateral assets, aggravate the prevailing deflationary
trends. Mergermania may thus hasten the unwinding of the Im-
perial Circle.
Assuming that the process does not end in disaster, what is its
overall effect? We find a mixed bag. In contrast to the conglomer-
ate boom where most of the activity was confined to the stock-
market, many changes will have occurred in the real world. On
balance, the profitability of corporations will be enhanced, assets
redeployed, and stodgy managements shaken up. Industiies will
have become more oligopolistic. As long as the Imperial Circle
prevails these changes are desirable and probably necessary for
the survival of many industries. If and when the competition from
imports abates, the changes may turn out to be just the opposite
of what is appropriate to the new conditions.* Accepting merger-

mania as a process of adjustment, we encounter a problem that is
t inherent in a world of reflexive interactions: adjustment to what?
It is like shooting at a target when the act of shooting moves the
target.
Even if corporate restructuring qualified as an adjustment pro-
cess, it would benefit from being slowed down. If the pace were
slower, fewer deals would be made because the rate of return
would become less favorable. That would be an improvement
because there is a tendency to make more deals than are justified
by long-term economic considerations. The tax laws are primarily
responsible, but the participants playing with other people's
msuey must ahso share part of the blame. England has a takeover
panel that reviews the rules of the game; we could benefit from a
similar arrangement.
I
On the level of theory, this analysis shows that the boom/bust
model is not directly applicable to all reflexive processes. With
this lesson in mind, we shall now address the question: what will
be the eventual outcome of the Imperial Circle?
P.S., DECEMBER 1986
As it happened, mergermania outlasted the Imperial Circle. Junk
bonds suffered a few nasty moments when oil dropped below $10
and LTV Corp. defaulted, but the market recovered. Both the eq-
uity and the junk bond holders of leveraged buyouts have been
greatly helped by the decline in interest rates, although junk
bonds have lagged behind high-quality bonds. The Tax Reform
Act of 1986 has had the perverse effect of accelerating the pace of
transactions prior to its taking effect on January 1, 1987.
Then came the Boesky affair and the arbitrage community was
shaken to its core. The full extent of the scandal is not yet known
but can be easily imagined. The investigation has already immo-
bilized many of the major players, and it is going to change the
way the game is played. By and large, the speculative excesses
generated by mergermania will be removed; what will be left is
the continuing restructuring of American corporations. The net
inflow of cash into junk bonds will be reversed and the extent to
which buyouts can be leveraged will be greatly reduced. Most
important, it will become more difficult to refinance deals when
they turn sour, and the junk aspect of junk bonds will become
more apparent.

In short, the Boesky affair constitutes not the end of corporate
restructuring but rather a well-defined and highly dramatic turn-
ing point in the reflexive aspect of mergermania. As in other sim-
ilar instances, it will be some time after the turning point when
the casualties surface. The EPICS of mergermania are yet to come.

THE STARTING POINT: AUGUST 1985
We shall take up the history of the Imperial Circle at around the
elections of 1984. Until then, the Imperial Circle had operated
without a hitch with both the U.S. economy and the U.S. dollar
continuing to rise. The central bankers of the world were fully
aware that the situation was unsound and ultimately unsustaina-
ble, and there was an episode at the beginning of 1984 when they
tried to talk down the dollar but the attempt failed and the dollar
rose higher than ever. The economy continued so strong that it
overcame even a modest rise in interest rates. Fore&i n ers holding
dollar-denominated financial assets were really r 'ng it in. So
were those exporting to the United States. Surprisingly, American
industry hung in there in the face of severe pressure from imports,
reluctant to transfer manufacturing abroad and trying to stay com-
petitive by investing in high technology. The critical point was
reached around the final quarter of 1984. The pace of the economy
was beginning to slacken and interest rates started to ease but the
dollar, after an initial dip, continued to rally. Prevailing opinion
had linked the strength of the dollar to the strength of the econ-
omy and to the interest rate differential. When the dollar refused
to weaken, the last of the trend fighters gave up and the exchange
rate went through the roof. That was the straw that broke the
camel's back: American industry started in earnest to switch to
imports and to foreign-based manufacturing. The strong dollar
finally became an American problem.
The conduct of U.S. economic policy underwent a significant
change after the elections. Treasury Secretary Donald Regan and

presidential adviser James Baker switched places. Until then, the
I
Federal Reserve and the Treasury had been at loggerheads, but
now an understanding was reached between them. Slowing down
the Imperial Circle became the clear-cut objective. It was to be
achieved by reducing the budget deficit and relaxing monetary
policy. America's main trading partners were encouraged to give
their policy the opposite twist, engaging in fiscal stimulation but
keeping up interest rates. It was hoped that under these influences
the dollar would finally decline. Treasury Secretary Baker went
so far as to express willingness to discuss a reform of the exchange
rate system prior to the Bonn economic summit in May 1985, but
he failed to follow through. He was also unsuccessfuI in ga'ining
control of the budget-cutting process in Congress; nevertheless,
t the administration is clearly determined to accept whatever form
Congress chooses for cutting the budget.
The dollar did respond with a thump, falling by about 15%
against the German mark. Then it stabilized for about three
months, and recently it started declining again. The adjustment
so far is unlikely to bring any significant relief to industry. The
economy is now divided into two segments: the tradable goods
sector is in recession with the capital goods sector particularly
weak, but the service and defense sectors are still strong. Interest
rates have fallen significantly and that is stimulating the econ-
omy, but as long as the dollar remains anywhere near its present
level, much of the stimulation will find its way abroad through
increased imports. Most important, the pressure on profits in the
tradable goods sector is unlikely to relent.
What is the outlook? We can draw up two scenarios. In the first
the dollar declines by, say, 20-25% bringing relief to the tradable
goods sector. Inflation may pick up a little, although the rise in
import prices may be compensated for by a decline in oil prices,
but the economy recovers, putting a floor under the dollar. This
is the so-called soft landing scenario. Its prospects are better than
at any time since the inception of the Imperial Circle because
the authorities have finally recognized the need to bring the self-
reinforcing process under control and are cooperating to that end.
It is conceivable that the ever more violent swings in exchange
rates will moderate as-unannounced and unrecognized as usual
-we pass from a system of free floating to a system of managed
floating.
The other possibility is that the dollar refuses to decline and,
when it finally breaks, it does so precipitously. At first, foreign

The Starting Point: August 1985 143
exporters absorb whatever small decline occurs and do not raise
their selling prices in the face of a weakening market. The tradable
goods sector continues under pressure, and the weakness threat-
ens to spread to the other sectors. The Federal Reserve, deter-
mined not to allow the economy to slip into recession because of
the dire consequences it would have on the banking system, con-
tinues to pump money into the economy but much of the stimu-
lation continues to leak out in the form of imports. Eventually, a
critical point is reached when foreigners become reluctant to hold
dollars, long-term interest rates rise in the face of rising money
supply numbers, the ddllar declines precipitously, and inflation
prospects deteriorate even as the ecouomy enkm+nb a full
fledged recession.
This may be called the disaster scenario, because a recession
would expose an exceedingly fragile financial structure to a test
that it is unlikely to withstand without severe damage. The heav-
ily indebted countries have barely entered into Phase 3 of their
adjustment process. A ;weakening in demand for their exports
could push them back into Phase 2 and the setback may be more
than they can bear. At home, the adjustment process is even less
advanced. A recession kould reduce the earnings capacity of bor-
rowers; it would also undermine the resale value of the assets that
serve as collateral. As banks try to liquidate foreclosed property
they set into motion a self-reinforcing process: other borrowers
are pushed over the brink. The process is alreadysrnder way in
the oil patch and in farming; in a recession it would spread to
other sectors of the economy.
This is where we stand at present (August 1985). As a market
participant, I must make some decisions based on my evaluation
of the probable course of events. The theory of reflexivity, as it
has been developed so far, does not yield any clear-cut predic-
tions, but it can be helpful in formulating my views. I have used
it in that capacity before and I shall attempt to do so now.
I propose an experiment. I shall record the views that guide me
in my investment decisions at the present time and I shall revise
them on a real-time basis while the book is in preparation. I shall
terminate the experiment when the book goes to the printer and
the reader will be able to judge the results. This will provide a
practical test of the value, if any, of my approach. It will also
provide an insight into the decision-making process of one market
participant.

fund I manage.* Quantum Fund is a unique instrument: it uses
leverage; it operates in many markets; and, most important, I man-
age it as if it were my own money-which it is to a large extent.
Many funds share one of these features, but I do not know of any
other that combines them all.
The best way to understand the role of leverage is to think of an
ordinary investment portfolio as something flat and loose, as its
name implies. Leverage adds a third dimension: credit. What was
a loosely held together, flat portfolio becomes a tightly knit three-
dimensional structure in which the equity base has to support the
credit used.
Leveraged funds usually employ their borrowed capital in the
same way as their equity base. That is not the case in Quantum
I Fund. We operate in many markets, and we generally invest our
equity in stocks and use our leverage to speculate in commodities.
Commodities in this context include stock index futures as well
as bonds and currencies. Stocks are generally much less liquid
than commodities. By investing less than our entire equity capital
in relatively illiquid stocks, we avoid the danger of a catastrophic
collapse in case of a margin call.
In managing the Fund, I distinguish between macroeconomic
and microeconomic investment concepts. The former usually dic-
tate our exposure in the various commodity markets, including
the stock market, while the latter find expression in our stock
selection. Thus the ownership of a specific stock has both a macro
and a micro aspect in the sense that it affects the total size of the
Fund's stock market exposure, and, if it is a foreign stock, it also
affects the Fund's currency exposure. By contrast, a stock index
or currency position has only a macro aspect. We can, of course,
always neutralize the macro aspect of a stock position through
stock indexes and currency futures.
As far as currencies are concerned, I believe that a system of
fluctuating exchange rates presents an existential choice: one can-
not avoid having one's equity invested in some currency, and not
making a decision about currency exposure is also a decision-
unless, of course, one were to buy a currency option, in which
case one would pay a measurable price for avoiding the choice.
The logical consequence of my attitude is that I feel obliged to
make a decision about currencies even if I do not have a well-

formulated macroeconomic investment concept. The results
can be disastrous. Sometimes I envy my more ignorant fund-
managing colleagues who do not know that they face an
existential choice; for instance, they avoided the losses I in-
curred in the 1981-198E period when the dollar continued to
appreciate.
It can be seen that Quantum Fund combines some of
the features of a stock market fund with those of a commodity
fund. Historically, Quantum Fund operated at first almost exclu-
sively in stocks; only as macroeconomic conditions became in-
creasingly unstable did bonds and currencies assume increased
importance. In the last few years macroeconomic speculation has
become paramount. The degree of leverage we employ is much
more modest than in pure commodity funds, and the exposure in
various markets serves t~ balance as well as to leverage the port-
folio.
The Fund's maximum exposure in any direction is subject to
self-imposed limits. If one relied on the limits imposed by margin
regulations, one would be asking for trouble, because one would
be forced to liquidate positions at the most inconvenient mo-
ments. One needs a safety margin over and above the margin
requirements. The safety margin can be quantified by looking at
the uncommitted buying power, but it is not a reliable measure
because different types of investments carry widely divergent
margin requirements. For instance, most U.S. stoas require a
50% margin, foreign stocks only 30-35% and the margin on S&P
futures is only 6%. Where to limit one's exposure is one of the
most difficult questions in operating a leveraged fund, and there
is no hard and fast answer. As a general rule, I try not to exceed
100% of the Fund's equity capital in any one market, but I tend to
adjust my definition of what constitutes a market to suit my cur-
rent thinking. For instance, I may add non-market-related stocks
and market-related stocks together or keep them separate as the
mood takes me.
Generally speaking, I am more concerned with preserving the
Fund's capital than its recent profits, so that I tend to become
more liberal with self-imposed limits when my investment con-
cepts seem to be working. Where to draw the line between capital
'
and profit is no easy task when practically the entire capital con-
sists of accumulated profits. The historical record up to the begin-

the only year prior to 1985 when the Fund more than doubled
was 1980, and that was followed by a debacle in 1981.
During Phase 1 of the experiment, the Fund's activities re-
volved mainly around macroeconomic issues; the microeconomic
concepts did not change much, and their contribution to the
fund's performance was relatively insignificant. Accordingly, in
summarizing the Fund's investment posture I focused only on the
macro aspect. The situation changed during the Control Period:
specific investment concepts made an increasing contribution to
the Fund's performance. This was in accordance with my macro
conclusion that it was time to play the stock market. Since the
microplays became important only during the Control Period, I
refrain from discussing them, with one exception: my play in
Japanese real-estate-related stocks enters into the discussion in
-
Phase 2.
The macro posture of the Fund is summarized in a table follow-
ing each diary entry, and the activities and performance of the
Fund are shown graphically at the end of each phase of the exper-
iment. The graphic presentation for the Control Period has been

four roughly equal time periods.

(2) Net purchases ( ) or sales ( - ) since previous report.
(3) Reduced to a common denominator of 30-year government
bonds. For instance, $100 million in face value of 4-year Trea-
sury notes is equivalent to $28.5 million in market value of
30-year government bonds.
(4) U.S. Treasury bills and notes up to two years to maturity;
these also have been reduced to a common denominator of
30-year bond equividents (see note 3).
(5) These bonds have cbnsiderably less volatility than U.S. gov-
ernment bonds. For instance, as of June 30, 1986, $100 mil-
lion in face value of Japanese government bonds had the same
volatility as roughly $66.2 million in 30-year U.S.g overnment
bonds. We have not,adjusted for this difference.
(6) Net currency exposure includes stocks, bonds, futures, cash,
and margins and equals the total equity of the Fsd. A short
position in dollars indicates the amount by which exposure
in the major currencies (DM-related European currencies,
yen, and sterling) exceeds the capital of the Fund. Exposure
in other currencies (mast of which do not fluctuate as much
as the major currencies) are shown separately. They are not
deemed relevant in calculating the Fund's dollar exposure.
Also, the percentage changes in net asset values in these tables
refer to per-share figures. The figures for Quantum Fund's aggre-
gate equity are affected, albeit modestly, by subscriptions and
redemptions.

PHASE 1: A UGUST 1985-DECEMBER 1985
1 BEGINNING OF THE EXPERIMENT: SUNDAY, AUGUST 18,
1985 *
The stock market has recently adopted the thesis that the rapid
rise in money supply is presaging a stronger economy. Cyclical
stocks started to improve, while interest-rate-sensitive and de-
fensive stocks suffered a setback. I had to decide what posture to
adopt. I was inclined to doubt the thesis, but I did not have
enough conviction to fight it. Accordingly, I did nothing. My
stock portfolio consists primarily of companies that stand to ben-
efit from corporate restructuring and of property insurance shares
that follow a cycle of their own.
As regards currencies, I have been leaning toward a soft-landing
scenario. In fact, I could envision the possibility that a stronger
economy would tend to strengthen the dollar. With so many spec-
ulators short, this could lead to a sharp, if temporary, rebound.
Thus, being short the dollar was not without risk. Accordingly, I
had significantly reduced my currency positions. For reasons I
shall outline below, I rebuilt them in the last few days.
I have been inclined to be optimistic on the prospects of a soft
landing because the decline of the dollar was induced by the
authorities; a spontaneous fall would have been much more dan-
gerous. Since the reelection of Reagan, the authorities have been
moving in the right direction and there seems to be a greater
degree of cooperation among them. Practically all the excesses of

the Imperial Circle are in the process of being corrected: banks are
returning to sounder practices, the budget deficit is being cut, and
interest rates are being reduced.
My optimism is tempered by the insight that the time when
past excesses are corrected is the period of greatest risk. The ex-
cesses were meeting a certain need; otherwise they would not
have developed in the first place. Can the system function with-
out them? Moreover, the process of correction can develop its
own momentum, setting off a self-reinforcing trend in the oppo-
site direction.
Everything hinges on the outlook of the economy. If the econ-
omy strengthened in the second half of 1985, all would be well.

150 The Real-Time Experiment
Even if there were renewed weakness in 1986, the financial struc-
I ture would already be in a stronger position to withstand the
consequences. In any case, that eventuality is too far removed to
have any relevance to current investment decisions.
I consider myself ill-qualified to match wits with professionals
who have much more information at their disposal in predicting
the actual course of the economy. That is why I have chosen to
stay on the sidelines in cyclical stocks.
The single most important variable is consumer spending.
Some experts claim that consumers are overextended; others
argue that if you make money available, the American consumer
can be counted on to spend it Who am 1 to judge? The only
competitive edge I have is the theory of reflexivity. It leads me
to diverge from the consensus opinion on the negative side. I be-
t
lieve we are in a period of credit contraction where collateral
values are eroding. It would be appropriate if consumers failed
to respond to stimulation. This is a typical Keynesian situation
where the horse is taken to the water: will it drink? I need more
evidence before I can develop any conviction on the negative
side.
Recently, I have perceived such signals. Perhaps the most
convincing was the market action itself. The stock market was
acting suspiciously badly. It may be surprising that I should ac-
cept the stock market as a valid indicator after I had enunciated
the principle that markets are always biased. But I have also
claimed that the market has a way of making predictions come
true.
Various economic reports also indicated continued weakness.
For instance, auto sales were do~vn3. did not aitrikte any great
importance to these reports, because the current weakness is well
recognized. What happens when General Motors starts its low
interest-rate promotion will be more significant. I was much more
impressed with the report that this year's crops are going to set
records. This meant that either the distress in the farming sector
would increase or much more money would have to be spent on
farm price support.
The currencies were pushing against the upper limits of their
trading range. The Bundesbank was expected to lower the dis-
count rate, but the mark refused to give ground. On Wednesday,
August 14, I decided to establish a half position in the German
mark; after the German discount rate was in fact lowered and the

==================================================

Phase 1: A ugust 1985-December 1985 151
mark remained firm, I bought the rest of my position. On Thurs-
day afternoon, the Federal Reserve announced a large increase in
MI; the increase in M3 was more moderate. Bonds fell and I
recognized that my thesis on currencies was going to be tested. If
the conventional wisdoin prevailed, currencies ought to fall in
the expectation of a strhnger economy and higher interest rates.
But if the tide has tuned, holders of dollar assets ought to re-
spond to a rise in money supply by converting part of that supply
into foreign currencies. As it happened, the currencies did not
yield, and my thesis was reinforced.
Then came further evi,dence. On Friday, both housing starts and
new permits were wee, especially for multifamily dwellings.
This confirmed my suspicion that the housing industry is in trou-
ble. In that case, commercial real estate must be in even worse
shape. Bonds rallied, but the stock market continued under pres-
sure.
I am now willing to bet that the slowdown in the economy is
going to deteriorate into a recession: the contraction in credit is
going to outweigh the increase in money supply. 1 suspect that
the divergence between MI and M3 is an indication that the horse
is not drinking. I am aeady to take on a maximum position in
currencies, both on a long-term and on a short-term basis and to
short bonds on the rally. If the currencies do not respond vigor-
ously, I may have to become more cautious and take a loss on the
short-term portion of my currency positions.
It may be asked why I should short bonds if I expes a recession.
The answer is that I expect a recession because long-term interest
rates will rise on account of a weakening dollar. This is the Im-
perial Circle moving into reverse gear. I realize that my sale may
be premature; consequently I will take only a small starting posi-
tion. I am also contemplating selling the stock market short but
only if it rallies in response to a declining dollar. Both my cur-
rency and my bond positions ought to work before I take on the
additional exposure.
The majority of my currency positions are in German marks. I
also have a significant position in yen but I expect the yen to
move slower and later. I should explain why. Japan has a very
high savings rate and domestic investment has tapered off. By
investing its savings abroad, Japan is able to maintain a level of
production well in excess of domestic consumption. This is the
way Japan can become a leading economic power in the world:



==================================================
                     PAGE 157                     
==================================================

152 The Real-Time Experiment
a high savings rate, a persistent export surplus, and an accumu-
1 lation of foreign assets go hand in hand to enhance Japan's
power and influence in the world. Japan is very happy with the
Imperial Circle and wants to prolong it as long as possible. The
policy is articulated by Japanese officials as follows: "We want
the United States to prosper as the leading economic power in
the world, because it allows us to prosper as number two." In
actual fact, Japan uses the United States as a cyclist uses a car
in front of him: to cut the wind resistance. Japan wants to stay be-
hind the United States as long as possible, and it is willing to
finance the U.S. budget deficit to this end. Long-term capital out-
flows from Japan rose from $17.7 billion in 3,983 to $49.7 billion
in 1984 and the trend is still rising. This has been the single
most important factor in keeping the yen down. Now that the
t
trend of the dollar has been reversed, the yen may appreciate
against the dollar, but it is likely to fall against the European
currencies.
I have had considerable difficulty in arriving at this conclusion.
In the 1970s, Japan followed a policy of keeping the value of the
yen high, creating a high hurdle that exporters had to pass in
order to export profitably. The policy was very successful in fa-
voring the industries in which Japan had the greatest competitive
advantage and in discouraging the older, less profitable exports.
I would have expected that in an environment where the rest
of the world was increasingly unwilling to tolerate a Japanese
export surplus, Japan would once again use the price mecha-
nism to ration its exports rather than to expose itself to quanti-
tative restrictions. This would have meant a high exchange rate
policy.
I failed to recognize the fundamental dissimilarity between the
two sets of circumstances. In the 1970s domestic investment
was still very high and available savings needed to be rationed;
a high exchange rate served as an efficient method of allocat-
ing resources. Now there is an excess of savings for which
outlets have to be found. Exporting capital is the best answer.
The resistance to Japanese exports remains a stumbling block,
but the Japanese hope to overcome it by providing generous
credit terms. Hence the willingness to finance the U.S. budget
deficit.
The American response is ambivalent. Some elements within
the administration are pushing for a higher yen; others are push-

ing for the sale of U.S. government securities to the Japanese.
Ironically, it was American pressure for the liberalization of cap-
ital markets that led to the current massive Japanese purchases of
U.S. treasury bonds. The interest rate differential in favor of the
U.S. was very great, ruhning as high as 6% at times. Once the
floodgates were released, Japanese institutions piled in. Since the
dollar has started to decline, the total return has become less
favorable, but it has not discouraged Japanese investors. On the
contrary, they seem to feel that the currency risk is less now that
the dollar has declined. Japanese investors are even more herdlike
than their American coynterparts. Should their bias shift, there
could be a stampede in ,the opposite direction. But that is highly
unlikely: the authorities act as shepherds, and they will do what-
ever is necessary to prevent a stampede. If my analysis is correct,
they are likely to keep the appreciation of the yen moderate
enough to preserve the prevailing bias in favor of U.S. government
bonds.
I should also explain ply views on oil prices. A decline is more
or less inevitable. Production capacity far exceeds demand and
the cartelis in the process of disintegration. Almost every mem-
ber of OPEC with the $exception of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait
cheats on prices. As a consequence, Saudi production has fallen
to unsustainably low levels. Saudi influence within OPEC has
declined in step with output. The only way Saudi Arabia could
reassert control is by engaging in an all-out price war that would
demonstrate the strength of its market position as gw-cost pro-
ducer. But its market strength is matched by its political weak-
ness. The result is a stalemate that leaves Saudi Arabia
immobilized. Market participants are bracing themselves for the
impending storm, but in the meantime calm prevails. Spot prices
are quite firm, because nobody wants to carry any inventory. The
longer the pressures build, the more violent the storm is likely
to be when it finally occurs. The supply curve is inverted.
Most producers need to generate a certain amount of dol-
lars; as the price falls, they will try to increase the amount sold
until the price falls below the point at which high cost producers
can break even. Many of them will be unable to service their
debt. The U.S. will be forced to introduce a protective tariff to
save the domestic producers, and the protection is likely to be
extended to Mexico, provided it continues to toe the line on the
debt issue.

==================================================

154 The Real-Time Experiment
I have been carrying a short position in oil for quite a while and
it has cost me a lot of money. Futures sell at a large discount from
cash: carrying the position forward can cost as much as 2% a
month. I am now inclined to close out the positions I hold in
nearby months and establish a short position for next spring. The
price would be lower, but the discount per month would also be
lower. If my analysis is correct, the later the break comes the
bigger it will be.
The views I have outlined here are sufficient to serve as a basis
for what I call macroeconomic investment decisions. But they do
not answer the question: what is going to happen to the Imperial
Circle? On that issue, my crystal ball is cloudy.
Other things being equal, the recession, if any, ought to be a
mild one. Monetary policy has been eased even before we entered
a recession; inventories are tightly controlled, and a declining
dollar should bring relief to the tradable goods sector, although
the benefit may be felt only with a delay of 6 to 18 months. But
other things are not equal. The financial structure is already under
strain and it may not be able to withstand a recession: defaults
could be self-reinforcing, both domestically and internationally.
The financial authorities are fully aware of the danger and are
determined to do everything in their power to prevent it. If it
comes to a choice between recession and inflation, the odds favor
inflation. This is not a forecast, but a reading of current monetary
policy.
Inflation would not be all bad: it would make the burden of
debt more bearable both by reducing real interest rates and by
boosting commodity prices. The question is whether a policy of
inflation could succeed. It is likely to elicit an allergic reaction
from the financial markets, inducing a "flight from the dollar and a
rise in nominal interest rates. If foreigners become unwilling to
finance our budget deficit, there must be a reduction in our GNP
one way or another. But then, the Japanese may be willing to
continue lending to us even if it provides them with a negative
total return.

was sufficient to scare me out of my small short position with a
loss, but 1 held on to my currency long positions on which I now
also show a loss. The only thing that has worked in my favor is
oil, where I used a strong market to extend my short positions to
next spring. On balance, my trading has been poor, and I am
losing heavily since the start of the experiment. Fortunately, the
profits I made earlier this year leave me in a still comfortable
position.
The cause of the reverse is a spate of statistics that indicate an
economic pickup. Money supply soared, the trade deficit de-

clined, employment figures improved, as did retail sales. Auto
I sales in particular exploded during the first ten days in which the
auto companies offered concessionary credit terms. The evidence
implies that the horse is drinking, after all.
I am inclined to fight the evidence and if I look hard enough I
can find enough quirks to explain most of the figures. One fact
remains: the surge in auto sales is sufficient to justify the rather
aggressive production schedule auto companies have been work-
ing on. Closer inspection shows that almost all the employment
gains were auto related. The crucial question is: what is happen-
ing to consumer spending as a whole? Are auto sales symptomatic
of consumer behavior, or will they be offset by redtic-ugd exgeildi-
tures in other areas? We shall only know the answer when it is
too late.
I
For the time being, I am clinging to the view that the economy
is quite weak. The decline in the dollar has not been large enough
to bring any relief to manufacturing. Agriculture is in worse shape
than ever. Homebuilding could give the economy another boost
-housing is primarily dependent on interest rates and employ-
ment-but I believe that the fallout from the contraction of credit
and erosion of collateral values as exemplified by the collapse of
EPIC, the Equity Planning subsidiary of the Community Savings
& Loan Association of Maryland, is going to depress the construc-
tion industry. Consumer debt is heavy, and strong auto sales now
will reduce sales in the future. When 1986 models go on sale next
month, the economy ought to slip back to the same position it
was in before the auto companies started to force-feed it with
promotional credit terms.
The Federal Reserve is reluctant to tighten czedit because of
the many weaknesses in the financial structure. If dollars are
being created faster than foreigners are willing to absorb them,
the exchange rate ought to resume its decline-unless the econ-
omy is strong enough to induce the Federal Reserve to tighten.
It always comes back to the same question: the strength of the
economy.
Since I cannot resolve it, I shall be guided by the market. The
German mark seems to have established a pattern that consists of
a sharp rise, an equally sharp break, and a halfway retracing of
the decline followed by a period of consolidation. If the pattern
holds, we ought to be at the bottom end of the second break. That
would fit in well with my economic scenario. If the pattern is

have an additional loss on the half position that I kept. That is the
penalty I must pay for having taken too large a position at the
wrong time.
If my currency positions looked safer, I would consider buying
some government bonds in the next refunding because real inter-
est rates are once again reaching unsustainable levels, especially
if Saudi Arabia is really going to step up oil production.
My views on the longer term outlook are once again beginning
to veer toward the pessimistic side. The financial structure has
sustained additional damage. I have already mentioned the EPIC
story; the Farm Credit System has gone public with its problems;
and the liquidity crisis in South Africa is establishing a new prec-
edent that may encourage banks to act even faster the next time a
similar situation arises. Although the U.S. economy is showing
signs of strength, the position of our financial institutions is
weaker than it seemed a few weeks ago.
SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 28,1985
We live in exciting times. The emergency meeting of the Group of
Five finance ministers and heads of central banks at the Plaza
Hotel last Sunday constitutes a historic event. It marks the official
transition from a system of free floating to a system of managed
floating. Readers of my chapter on reflexivity in currency markets
will realize that I regard the change as overdue.
I managed to hang on to my currency positions by the skin of
my teeth and after the meeting of the Group of Five last Sunday, I
made the killing of a lifetime. I plunged in, buying additional yen
on Sunday night (Monday morni~gin &ng Kong) and hung on
to them through a rising market. The profits of the last week more
than made up for the accumulated losses on currency trading in
the last four years, and overall I am now well ahead.
What gave me the courage to hold on to my currency posi-
tions was the pronounced weakness of the stock market. The
strength of the dollar depends on the strength of the economy. A
decline in stock prices can have considerable influence on the
spending decisions of consumers and the investment decisions
of those in business. Moreover, if there is going to be a reces-
sion, it will be brought on by the decline in collateral values,

The deutsche mark barely held within the perceived pattern
and my nerves were sorely tested, but by the time the Group of
Five met, the mark had rallied in conformity with the perceived
pattern. I am glad to report that the market reaction to the meeting
broke the perceived pattern. Patterns are there to be broken by
historic events and the meeting truly qualifies as one.
The meeting was organized at the initiative of the Treasury. The
Federal Reserve was brought in relatively late. Its main purpose
was to relieve the intensity of protectionist pressure. It was held

to appreciate, the difficulty will be in arresting the trend. It
would not surprise me'if Volcker spent most of his time Sunday
discussing not how to bring down the dollar, but how to arrest
its fall.
Since the meeting 1 have concentrated on the yen because that
is the currency that matters as far as protectionist sentiment is
concerned, but if the policy of intervention is successful, I intend
to stay with the mark'longer than with the yen. The yen will
appreciate to a reasonable level, say 200 to the dollar, but the
mark may become overvalued. Eventually, the real play may be
in gold, especially in case of a recession in the U.S.
Th action in ~tock~pricehsa s been much worse &an, 1 ex-
pected. In fact, I bought the S&P Futures after the Group of Five
meeting for a trade and I had to liquidate the position with a loss.
Altogether, the market action is quite ominous. The erosion of
collateral values seems'to be much worse than I anticipated a few
months ago. I now believe that the economy will slip into a reces-
sion before the measures now undertaken will have had time to
bring relief. I also believe that additional measures will be forth-
coming. Just as protectionist pressures brought a change in the
exchange rate regime, the pressure of high real interest rates may
well bring a far-reaching arms agreement and d6tente at the No-
vember summit. I am worried about the next six months, but I see
better prospects for positive policy initiatives than at any time
since the Imperial Circle came into existence. Odalance, I do
not see much scope in taking a bearish posture in stocks, although
I see a lot of merit in liquidity and I wish I had more of it.
My short positions in oil have been going against me. The So-
viet Union cut back on deliveries and Kargh Islmd has been effec-
tively put out of action. I decided to cover my short position for
March and April by going long for January. The discount is the
largest between now and January. Keeping a short position open
has become very expensive. By buying for January, 1 have effec-
tively stopped the clock; I intend to reestablish my short position
later.

discount the rumors. In fact, I am using the current strength to
somewhat reduce my short positions in the dollar. I intend to
increase them further during the refunding period for U.S. gov-
ernment bonds.
Since the Group of Five meeting, there has been a lot of contro-
versy between the Treasury and the White House, on the one
hand, and the Federal Reserve on the other, some of which has

Phase 1 :A ugust 1985-December 1985 163
seeped into the press. ,The politicians seem to advocate "dirty
intervention" in currency markets, while the Federal Reserve has
religiously sterilized all the dollars it sold by selling an equivalent
amount of Treasury bills. The politicians argue that sterilized
intervention never works in the long run, but if the sale of dol-
lars is allowed to increase the money supply the exchange rate
is bound to fall. Volqker's reply is that there is no need to
be so aggressive because the dollar is going to decline any-
how. If the markets are flooded with dollars, the dollar may go in-
to a free fall that may be difficult to arrest. Volcker seems to
be more concerned with preventing a collapse than with in-
ducing a decline, and E sympathize with what 1 ticlieve ta be his
position.
If I were in his place I would keep interest rates stable until the
refunding is completed, selling foreigners all the dollars they
want for the purchase of government securities, and I would
lower interest rates after the auctions. This would ensure that the
auctions are successful;a nd it would provide me with a large war
chest to arrest the decline of the dollar when it has gone far
enough. The economyqisv ery weak and both interest rates and
the dollar need to be bought down. By waiting with an interest
rate reduction until after the auctions I could make a large-scale,
sterilized sale of dollars at a level that would look very good
later.
It is this line of argument that prompts me to bysome dollars
now. The market may be disappointed if there is no immediate
action on interest rates, allowing the Federal Reserve to sell dol-
lars at higher prices. That is when I want to increase my short
position even furtiler. I am also interested in buying bocds in iire
refunding unless they go up too much in the meantime. I have not
made any major moves in the stock market but I have whittled
down my long positions and enlarged my short positions to a
point where I seem to have a slight negative market exposure,
although my long positions far outweigh my shorts in actual dol-
lar amounts. I am increasing my short positions in Texas and
California banks.

raising short-term interest rates. I took this as the beginning of a
new phase in the Group of Five plan in which exchange rates are
influenced not only by direct intervention but also by adjusting
interest rates. Accordingly, I piled into the yen. When the yen
moved, I also bought back the marks I had sold. I lost money on
the trade but ended up with the increased position I wanted. At
today's prices I have a profit on the maneuver.

==================================================

Phase 1: August 1985-December 1985 165
There is something unsound about increasing one's exposure
in the course of a trend because it makes one vulnerable to a
temporary reversal. It will be recalled that a reversal came close
to making me disgorge my currencies at the wrong time earlier in
this experiment. The reason I am nevertheless willing to increase
my exposure is that I'believe that the scope for a reversal has
diminished. One of thy generalizations I established about freely
floating exchange rates is that short-term volatility is greatest at
turning points and diminishes as a trend becomes established.
That is the case now. The fact that we are no longer in a system of
freely floating exchange rates should diminish the risk of a rever-
sal even further. Market particfpazta hava not y& recognized the
new rules; the amount of exposure they are willing to carry is
influenced by the volatility they have experienced in the past.
The same is true of me, or I would have reached my present level
of exposure much earlier, and I would have made even more
money on the move. By the time all the participants have ad-
justed, the rules of thei game will change again. If the authorities
handle the situation well, the rewards for speculating in curren-
cies will become commensurate with the risks. Eventually, spec-
ulation will be discouraged by the lack of rewards, the authorities
will have attained their goal, and it will be time for me to stop
speculating.
I have also missed the beginning of a move in bonds. When
interest rates rose in Japan and to a lesser exteaP.in Germany,
the market recognized that interest rates must fall in the United
States and bond prices rose in anticipation. My well-laid plan of
buying in the auction was preempted. I had to run after a mov-
ing vehicle and climb aboard the best I could. So far, i kave-estzb-
lished a half position at not very good prices. I intend to double
up in the next auction series in November. I must also consider
increasing my stock market exposure for reasons that I shall
explain.
This is a good time to reassess the entire outlook. The contro-
versy surrounding the Gramm-Rudman amendment has clearly
demonstrated that public opinion is in favor of cutting the budget
deficit. The Gramm-Rudman amendment was a brilliant device to
enable the president to cut programs that would be otherwise
untouchable. The cuts would start to take effect after the 1986
elections. The House of Representatives has gone one better by
insisting that the cuts should start in the current fiscal year and

fall more heavily on defense. The Senate version would have
4 favored the Republicans in the 1986 election, but the House Dem-
ocrats turned the table by exempting many social programs and
bringing forward the effective date. The White House is in a quan-
dary: it must do something about the budget deficit in order to
pave the way to lower interest rates, but to raise taxes before the
1986 elections would be suicidal. There is a way out: to reach
some accommodation with the Soviet Union at the summit meet-
ing and reduce defense spending. The budget issue would be
resolved and the Republicans could run in the 1986 election as
the party of peace. It remains to be seen whether Reagan is inter-
ested in this soluiion.
If it came to pass, we would enter a phase of great prosperity
with lower interest rates, a lower dollar, and a stock market boom.
4
The enthusiasm generated by these moves would help to get the
economy going again and the Baker Plan announced at the recent
annual meeting of the World Bank in Seoul would help to keep
the heavily indebted countries from collapsing. Mergermania
would receive one last push from lower interest rates but it would
eventually run out of steam because rising stock prices would
make new deals uneconomic. With the benefits of corporate re-
structuring, profits would soar in a more benign environment and,
with the shrinkage of equity capital that has occurred, stock
prices could go through the roof. Eventually, the boom would be
followed by a bust in which the uneconomic deals come apart
and the international debt problem also comes back to haunt
us, but stock prices would have to rise before they can collapse.
That is why I am contemplating raising my stock market expo-
sure.
We are approaching the moment of truth. If Reagan flubs his
opportunity, the consequences could be serious. We are hovering
on the edge of a recession and we need both lower interest rates
and a lower dollar to prevent an unraveling of credit. Even then,
quite a lot of monetary stimulation may be needed to get the
economy going again. It takes time for the decline in the value of
the dollar to bring relief from import competition. In the first
instance, the expectation of higher prices may divert domestic
demand to imported goods. Only a significant drop in short-term
interest rates, accompanied by better bond and stock prices, could
reverse sentiment in time to prevent a recession. Without an
agreement on Gramm-Rudman, the bond market could be disap-

pointed, the Federal Reserve would be reluctant to lower interest
rates aggressively, and the erosion in collateral values would con-
tinue.
The collapse of the International Tin Council provides a perfect
illustration of the erosjon of collateral values. The collapse of
OPEC is only a matte; of time now. I am increasing my short
positions in oil for Jqnuary to March delivery. By the same
token I am buying oil-refining stocks, because the increased flow
should help their margins. As for the big picture, the next
couple of weeks will tell the tale. The summit meeting is on
November 19 and thelbudget debate has to be resolved before
the nextaauction can take place. That is W~JJI have decided
to wait until the auction before taking a full position in
bonds.
SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 9,1985
My views on currencies are being tested. After a sharp rise in
the yen, there was a sharp reversal last Thursday. I was told
that the Bundesbank had bought dollars below DM 2.60 but it
sold them again at DM 2.645 on Friday. In accordance with my
contention that there is less risk in the market I refused to be
panicked.
The bond market is poised for a breakout on the upside. There
are large option positions in Treasury bond futurss that expire
next Friday. If the futures price moves above 80 before then, I
intend to sell all or part of my position, because I believe the
market is vulnerable. The White House cannot compromise on
the budget befose the summit on November 19 and the Democrats
will continue to press their advantage. This means a stalemate for
the next week or so, followed by an auction as soon as it is re-
solved. I would be happy to withdraw from the market with a
profit, putting me in a strong position to buy at the time of the
auction.
The stock market has also been strong. Divergences have per-
sisted but the market broadened out on Friday. A breakout in
bonds could coincide with a temporary top in the stock market,
to be followed by a correction. I want to use that opportunity to
cover my shorts and prepare to take a long position. If the correc-
tion does not occur, I shall cover my shorts with a loss and if the
summit is successful go long at higher prices.

I also took a significant position in Japanese bond futures. This

92) when the Japanese government raised short-term interest
t rates. Experience has taught me that the best buying opportunities
in long-term bonds present themselves when the yield curve is
inverted-which is the case in Japan today. The rise in Japanese
interest rates is bound to be temporary: the Group of Five wants
to stimulate worldwide economic activity, not to dampen it. A
reduction in U.S. interest rates would be matched by the other
major industrial countries and, if the impact on exchange rates
can be neutralized, the reduction may go further than currently
envisioned. I am making the same bet in Japan as in the U.S. and
the odds seem even better.
I sm now fully invested in all directions: stocks, bonds, and
currencies. I would have obtained better prices if I had not tried
to finesse it, or if the finesse had worked-but the main thing is
I
that I reached the posture I wanted. I am looking for an opportu-
nity to shift from bonds to stocks but I consider it prudent not to
increase my overall exposure any further.
Events have unfolded more or less as I expected. The only
hitch was in the Gramm-Rudman amendment. Congress passed
a one-month extension of the debt ceiling, enabling the auc-
tion to go forward while the fate of Gramm-Rudman remains un-
resolved.
The summit meeting lived up to my expectations. I believe a
radical shift in U.S.-Soviet relations is in the making. Both sides
need to reduce their military spending and both sides have much
to gain from closer cooperation. The opportunity was there and
President Reagan seized it. By not making any concessions on
Star Wars, Reagan has put himself in a position to usher in an-
other period of detente without exp~singh imself to criticism for
selling out to the Russians. In this context, the Gramm-Rudman
amendment may come in positively useful as a mechanism for
cutting the military budget without appearing to want to. The
most eminently cuttable part of the military budget is retirement
benefits-Stockman made an impassioned plea on the subject be-
fore quitting-and Gramm-Rudman may provide the perfect ex-
cuse. I expect a fairly stiff version of Gramm-Rudman to be
enacted-one that is closer to the House version than to the Sen-
ate. In the present setting, that would no longer be as detrimental
to the Republicans' election chances in 1986 as it seemed a few
weeks ago.
Gramm-Rudman would be followed by a discount rate cut in

short order. That is what makes me take on the maximum expo-
sure in bonds at the piesent time. I realize there may be some
indigestion in the market after the auctions, but if my analysis is
correct there is still something left to go for.
After a discount rate c;ut I intend to cut my bond exposure and
increase my stock positions. Stocks are more open-ended on the
upside than bonds. If and when the economy rebounds, stocks
will do better than bonds. If the economy continues to languish,
the reduction in short-term interest rates may go much further
than currently expected, but the dollar would also come under
pressure so that the yield curve is likely to steepen. It should be
remembered that d6tente is bearish fa: the dollas vis-l-vis Euro-
pean currencies. If one wants to stay in bonds, the place to be is
the short end.
We may be on the verge of a great stock market boom. Industrial
companies have suffered from a combination of inadequate prices
and inadequate demand. These adverse conditions have resulted
in the wholesale restructuring of corporate America. Many com-
panies have been swallowed up by takeovers and leveraged buy-
outs. Those which have survived have tightened their belts,
disposing of losing divibions and cutting corporate overhead. Pro-
ductive capacity has been cut rather than increased, and market
share has been concenti-ated in fewer hands. The lower dollar is
now in the process of relaxing pricing pressures; if there is any
pickup in demand, it goes straight to the bottom l b . L ower in-
terest rates and the lower inflation rate combine to make a given
level of earnings more valuable. After a period when industrial
shares were selling at a discount from their breakup value we may
enter a period when they once again sell at a premim. But before
we get there, we are likely to experience another wave of take-
overs, induced by the decline in interest rates.
END OF PHASE 1: SUNDAY, DECEMBER 8,1985
This may be a good point to terminate the real-time experiment.
I have assumed maximum market exposure in all directions
and I have also announced my intention to shift gradually from
bonds to stocks within the constraints of prudence. At present
a large part of my stock market exposure is in the form of index
futures. With the passage of time I shall try to develop specific
stock investment concepts, and my performance will be increas-

Circle at the present time and submit it to the test of events.
Needless to say, I shalt continue changing my portfolio as I see
fit.
I have about as firm a conviction about the shape of things to
come as I shall ever hgve, as witnessed by the level of market
exposure I am willing t'o assume. At the beginning of the experi-
ment 1 said that my crygtal ball about the longer term outlook was
rather cloudy. The experiment has brought about a remarkable
transformation: I now have a relatively clear vision of the future
and that vision differs significantly from the admittedly tentative
views I started with. I regarded the Imperial Circle as a temporary
expedient whose internal contmdictions were bOu~dto render .it
unsustainable, and my presumption was that the problems that
the Imperial Circle had managed to keep at bay would resurface
with renewed vigor after its disintegration. Specifically, the Im-
perial Circle constituteil an artificial extension of the period of
credit expansion with the U.S. government acting as "borrower of
last resort." When the Imperial Circle ceased to attract capital
from abroad in ever-inbreasing quantities, the last engine of eco-
nomic stimulation would be extinguished, and the contraction of
credit would create an'untenable situation. Without a significant
expansion of money supply the burden of debt would become
unbearable; with a significant expansion, the dollar would go into
a free fall.
I am now beginning to discern the outlines of awther tempo-
rary solution that may succeed in unwinding the excesses of the
Imperial Circle without plunging us into a vicious circle. The
solution consists of switching from fiscal to monetary stimulation
in the United States and controlling the descent of the dollar
through international cooperation. The new constellation is al-
most the exact opposite of the Imperial Circle: a weaker dollar
and a subdued economy are accompanied by lower budget and
trade deficits and, most important, by lower interest rates. With
the help of a weaker dollar, prices are going to rise somewhat
faster than previously, rendering the change in real interest rates
all the more pronounced. Declining real interest rates, together
with a possible pickup in exports, will replace the budget deficit
as the main driving force in the economy. Rising prices will help
to counteract the erosion of collateral values and prevent a self-
reinforcing, deflationary process from taking hold. At the same
time, the coordination of economic policies will keep the decline
of the dollar within bounds, thereby eliminating the possibility of

' a self-reinforcing inflationary process. The outcome would be a
greater degree of stability than we have experienced since the
breakdown of Bretton Woods.
Using the notation adopted earlier, we can depict the key rela-
tionship in the newly emerging state of affairs as follows:
The picture is much simpler than that of the Imperial Circle be-
exchange rates are stabilized. The extent to which interest
rates will decline depends on the amount of stimulation that will
be necessary to keep the economy from sliding into a reces-
I
sion.
Although the new constellation is almost the exact opposite of
the Imperial Circle, there is one essential difference between
them. The new constellation is the deliberate outcome of a con-
certed economic policy, whereas the Imperial Circle was the un-
intended consequence of conflicting economic policies. The
Imperial Circle was self-reinforcing until it became excessive and
ripe for a reversal; the reversal would also become self-reinforcing
unless it were deliberately controlled. The mechanism of control
is the management of exchange rates in the first instance and the
coordination of monetary and fiscal policies in the second.
It is the emergence of a concerted economic policy that has
caused me to change my expectations in the course of the experi-
ment. I was aware of the possibility of such a policy emerging and
I stressed the difference between the first and the second Reagan
administrations. During the three months of the experiment, there
occurred several historic events that converted a mere possibility
into a historical reality: the Group of Five meeting, the Baker
speech in Seoul, the Grarnm-Rudman amendment and the summit
meeting in Geneva.
What makes the emergence of the new economic direction so
fascinating is that the actual policy measures of which it will be
made up have not even been formulated. The Group of Five meet-
ing was merely a commitment to follow a coordinated exchange
rate policy, not an agreement on what that policy is; the Baker
Plan for international debt is certainly not a plan but merely the
announcement of a need for a plan; the summit meeting may mark
a new departure in relations between the superpowers, but it pro-

duced no concrete results; and the fate of the Gramm-Rudman
amendment is still uncertain at the time of writing.
The actual policies are yet to be formulated. How far they will
reach will depend partly, on the farsightedness of the policymak-
ers but mainly on the pressure of necessity. Necessity may be
defined in this context as the need to preserve the integrity of the
financial and trading syk t ems, or, in other words, to forestall a
collapse in credit and to eep protectionism at bay. The definition
is rather cavalier: it does not rule out individual defaults or par-
ticular instances of trade restraint; the crucial issue is that neither
Success is far from assured. Past experience is not encouraging.
A somewhat similar set of circumstances led to the collapse of
both credit and international trade in the 1930s. But exactly be-
cause the memory of the: 1930s is still so vivid, the prospect that
we shall avoid similar mistakes is rather favorable. There is gen-
eral agreement on some policy objectives: a controlled descent of
the dollar and a concerted reduction in interest rates. There is less
agreement on other points: how to reduce the U.S. budget deficit
and how to stimulate the economies of the debtor countries. It is
difficult to obtain concerted action even on the generally agreed
objectives. For instance; Japan was obliged to raise interest rates
because the United States was unable to resolve the issue of the
budget deficit in time. How can one have any cddence that
appropriate action will be taken in those areas where even the
agreement on objectives is missing?
Clearly, the situation is far from riskless, and, as we shall see,
the risks are the greatest in the short term. It is exa~tlyb e,' -3use
the risks are so great, and their severity is recognized, that one
can have a fair degree of confidence that the necessary measures
will be forthcoming. I am not the only one to think so: the finan-
cial markets have endorsed the new policy departure in no uncer-
tain fashion. The rise in bond and stock prices is helpful in two
ways: it encourages the authorities to pursue the course on which
they have embarked, and it enhances the chances of success. For
instance, the strength of the bond market enlarges the Federal
Reserve's freedom of action in lowering interest rates. We are
dealing with a reflexive process where the direction of economic
policy and the direction of the financial markets mutually rein-
force each other.
It is the response of the financial markets that has given me the

courage to take on such a large market exposure. It will be recalled
t that in the case of currencies when the change in trend was still
uncertain I was much more tentative and when the market moved
against me I was a hair's breadth away from cutting back my
position. In fact, the real-time experiment was instrumental in
helping me to hang in there because seeing my ideas clearly for-
mulated strengthened my convictions. My success in the market-
place has reinforced my confidence in my ability to predict the
course of events even further. 1985 is shaping up as a record-
breaking year for Quantum Fund: a more than 100% appreciation
within a year is heady stuff. I have to be careful. Using the concept
of reflexivity to predict the -future course of events is itself a re-
flexive process, and a high degree of success is often the precursor
to a severe setback. It is clear from the experiment that my percep-
tions are partial and subject to correction by events. If I begin to
lay store on my longer term expectations-and what is worse, go
public with them-I may be setting myself up for a great fall. It is
a danger I intend to guard against. It will be interesting to see,
when we control the experiment, what will have remained of my
current game plan.
Actually, it is less dangerous to cany a large market exposure
at the present juncture than to predict the eventual outcome of
the policies that are now being formulated. The mere fact that
there is an attempt to take charge of the world economy is suffi-
cient to give the financial markets a boost and, even if the hopes
are going to be disappointed, it will take time for the failure to
become evident; thus the attempt at a concerted policy should be
sufficient to sustain the present rally for a while. The eventual
outcome is quite another matter. There can be no assurance that
the market's expectations will be fulfilled. I must beware not to
allow my confidence in a bull market to affect my judgment about
the real world. I have become so involved in the market that I find
it difficult to maintain perspective.
I shall try to assess the future of the Imperial Circle in two
different ways: one is to identify the "thesis" that the current
market rally incorporates and evaluate its chances of success; the
other is to locate the present moment within the theoretical
framework of credit expansion and contraction that I have been
trying to formulate. Both approaches employ the concept of re-
flexivity, but the first one sticks closely to the reflexivity inherent
in financial markets while the second seeks to explore the reflex-

ive connection betweep credit and collateral values. Needless to
say, I am on much surer grounds with the first approach.
I believe the market has come around to the view that the econ-
omy is fundamentally,w eak and inflation nonexistent. A brief
rally in cyclical stockslin early summer has petered out and the
highs reached then have still not been surpassed. That rally has
been based on the mistaken expectation of an imminent pickup
in the economy, and it was very narrow: other segments of the
stock market were declining while the cyclicals rose. It was fol-
lowed by a general market decline that was cushioned by takeover
and stock buy-back activity. Commodities also made new lows
and have been lagging Sn the current recovery. Metals, in particu-
lar, have acted very poorly in relation to currencies.
The recent stock market rally is much more broadly based than
the earlier flurry in cyclicals; it follows on the heels of a bond
market rally and it was preceded by a decline in the dollar. Ob-
viously the markets are discounting a decline in the economy.
Whether it will deteri~ratef urther is an open question. Econo-
mists are almost unanimous in ruling out a recession, but the
stock and bond markets are acting as though it were an accom-
plished fact: stock prices are rising because investors are "looking
across the valley." It is possible that the slowdown of the past
year served as the equivalent of a recession; alternatively, there is
some further weakness to come. Either way, the sequence of
events is highly unusual and investors have beedaken by sur-
prise: none of the technical indicators that normally signal a sig-
nificant upturn in the stock market has been present. The
November 27 lead article in the Wall Street Journal entitled
"Strange Rally" has highlighted this fact.
Every recession since the end of the Second World War has
been preceded by the Federal Reserve tightening the money
supply, causing an inverted yield curve to appear at some point
along the line. An inverted yield curve preceded the rally in
the summer of 1982, but we have not seen an inverted yield
curve since. The explanation for the current sequence of
events has to be sought elsewhere. That is where the second
approach using my hypothesis about the credit cycle comes in
handy.
It will be recalled that I envision a reflexive relationship be-
tween the act of lending and the value of the collateral that serves
as security for the loans. Net new lending acts as a stimulant that



==================================================
                     PAGE 187                     
==================================================

178 The Real-Time Experiment
enhances the borrowers' ability to service their debt. As the
amount of debt outstanding grows, an increasing portion of new
lending goes to service outstanding debt and credit has to grow
exponentially to maintain its stimulating effect. Eventually the
growth of credit has to slow down with a negative effect on col-
lateral values. If the collateral has been fully utilized, the decline
in collateral values precipitates further liquidation of credit, giv-
ing rise to a typical boomlbust sequence.
Using this model, I contend that the postwar period of credit
expansion has run its course and we are now in a period of credit
contraction as far as the real economy is concerned. All previous
postwar recessions occurred during the expiillsiontuy phase: that
is why they had to be induced by tight money. We are now in the
contractionary phase where a slowdown need not be induced: in
the absence of new stimulants, such as a growing budget deficit,
the erosion of collateral values will do the job.
The trouble is that real life is not as simple as the model I have
been working with. In particular, the transition from credit expan-
sion to credit contraction does not occur at a single point of time
because it would precipitate an implosion that the authorities are
determined to prevent. Official intervention complicates matters.
The turning point does not occur at a single moment of time, but
different segments of the credit structure follow different time-
tables. To locate our position in the credit cycle, it is necessary to
disaggregate the process and consider the main elements of credit
separately.
This approach yields 1982 as the turning point for the heavily
indebted countries, 1984 as the turning point for U.S. financial
institutions, and 1986 as the turning poi& for the U.S. budget
deficit. The contraction of credit in less developed countries has
probably reached its peak in 1984; the adjustment process is
largely responsible for the oversupply of basic commodities. The
adjustment process by U.S. banks and savings and loan institu-
tions has only recently begun to make its effect felt on collateral
values in real estate, land, shipping, and the oil industry. The
reduction in the budget deficit has not yet taken effect and it is to
be expected that it will be fully compensated for by a reduction
in interest rates. Two more important pieces need to be fitted into
the jigsaw puzzle: mergermania and consumer spending.
Leveraged buyouts and other manifestations of mergermania
are great users of credit but they tend to produce a corresponding

Phase 1 :A ugust 1985-December 1985 179
amount of liquid assets. Superficially, they seem to be expansion-
ary but in fact they fit into the declining phase of the credit cycle:
they increase the total amount of debt without stimulating the
economy. Cash flow is, used to service debt rather than to pur-
chase physical assets; t$e disposal of assets adds to the downward
pressure on collateral dalues; and the sale of junk bonds tends to
steepen the yield curve: the net effect on the economy is depress-
ing rather than stimulafing.
Consumer spending is the great unknown. Consumer indebt-
edness has been rising steadily over the years, and repayment
terms have been extended to a point where it is hard to see
how they can be extended cny further. Until recently, houses
could be bought with a 5% down payment and auto loans could
be repaid over five years. Delinquencies in consumer loans have
risen ominously in the course of 1985, but the simultaneous
decline in interest rates and the dollar should alleviate the
situation. Will these ,developments merely serve to contain
the delinquency problem, or will they stimulate new demand?
That is the crucial question on which the near-term outlook
hinges.
If consumer spending remains sluggish, the bull market in
bonds and stocks may have considerable staying power; in fact,
we could have one of the great bull markets of all times. A pickup
in the domestic savings rate would offset the reduction in the
inflow of foreign capital allowing interest rates to dgcline in spite
of the decline in the dollar. The stock market would benefit from
both developments. Lower interest rates would enhance the value
of a given level of earnings, and the lower dollar would enhance
the level of earnings by mitigating pricing pressures from imports.
In a sluggish economy the cost of labor would remain depressed.
Threatened by adverse economic conditions and corporate take-
overs, managements have redeployed assets and reduced over-
head expenses; as conditions improve, the benefits flow directly
down to the bottom line. As interest rates decline, there would be
one last rush of corporate takeovers and leveraged buyouts, in the
course of w1h'c h exaggerated prices may be paid; but recent events
make past a quisitions more viable and deals that may have been
unsound w en consummated are now looking healthier. Even-
tually the hise in stock prices should render leveraged buyouts
uneconomic, and merger activity should peter out. That would be
a very p'ositive development for the real economy because it

==================================================

180 The Real-Time Experiment
would enhance the attraction of investing in physical assets stim-
4 ulating not only demand but also supply. Should we reach that
point, our economy would be healthier than it has been for some
time. The boom may eventually get out of hand and set us up for
a great crash, but share prices would have to rise a great deal
before we reach that point. It is an argument for buying stocks
now.
On the other hand, if consumer spending does pick up under
the impetus of lower interest rates, the boom in financial markets
will be short-lived and the real economy is likely to follow the
stop-go pattern familiar from the British example. With inade-
quate domestic savings and doaesti~ia veshnent, the excess of
both credit and consumption would have to be met from abroad
and we would be back in the situation that prevailed at the end
4
of the Imperial Circle. Either we raise interest rates, restarting the
Imperial Circle and choking off the domestic economy, or we
print money, setting in motion a vicious circle in the opposite
direction.
Reality is likely to fall between these extremes, but that is not
saying much because the extremes open up an almost infi-
nite range of possibilities. I am no better qualified to predict con-
sumer behavior than I was at the beginning of the experiment.
All I can do is evaluate the consequences of the various alterna-
tives.
It can be seen that a period of subdued consumer spending
could do much to correct the last two major areas of excess credit.
Mergermania would run out of steam as the stock market rises
and the overindebtedness of consumers would be corrected as the
savings rate rises and lenders tighter1 their criteria. Mer a while,
conditions would-be ripe for more balanced growth.
When past excesses are being corrected it is always a period of
maximum risk. That is the case now. There have already been a

events yet to come. We are facing at least two shocks that exceed
in magnitude anything we have experienced to date. One relates
to oil, the other to international debt.
The collapse of oil prices is only a matter of time. Once it begins
it will not stop of its owh volition. Most countries operate with a
perverse supply curve: ihe lower the price of oil, the more they
need to sell in order to meet their needs. Left to itself, the price of
oil could temporarily fall to a single digit, but it will not be left to
itself. Domestic industry will have to be protected below $22,
otherwise the losses would exceed the capacity of the banks to
absorb them. I would expect to see some kind of protection that
woukl also extend to Mexico and Canada. I wonder how the
North Sea producers will be protected. The problem will be a
difficult one for the European Economic Community to resolve.
How it is dealt with may determine the future of the Common
Market.
The problem of international debt has not gone away. Indeed,
the debt of the less developed countries has continued to grow,
although some countries have been able to improve their debt
ratios. Negative resource transfers probably reached their peak in
1984 and, as debtor countries insist on reflating their economies,
negative resources transfers are beginning to decline. The cohe-
sion of the lenders' collective has eroded. The run on South Af-
rica, in particular, has driven a wedge between American and
European banks. In the United States, the interests omoney cen-
ter banks and regional banks diverge. The Baker Plan demon-
strates an awareness of the problem but it falls far short of a
solution. Until a solution is developed, the system remains acci-
dent prone, although it is not clear where the next accident is
likely to occur. The banking system is now strong enough to with-
-
stand a single shock; the danger is that several shocks may coin-
cide.
There is yet a third danger that will develop as the stock market
boom gathers momentum: the danger of a crash in the stock mar-
ket. At present, market participants are still very conscious of the
problems and as a consequence are quite liquid. But it is in the
nature of a boom that it attracts ever-increasing amounts of credit.
If a financial shock occurs when many stock market participants
are overextended, margin liquidation could cause an implosion
of stock prices. We are a long way from that stage: at present, a
sudden financial shock, like the failure of yet another bank, could

182 The Real-Time Experiment
cause a short, sharp break in prices, but the market would recover.
I The bull market is likely to be punctuated with such breaks until
participants will cease to fear them. That is when we shall be set
up for a crash.
The financial system has been severely tested and the testing
is not yet over. The fact is that the system survived and the re-
cent changes in economic management improve the chances
that it will continue to survive. The process of credit con-
traction has been accomplished without a bust so far and one
can now see a way in which it could be completed without a
bust, albeit at the cost of a prolonged period of substandard
growth.
Substandard growth is less than desirable almost by definition,
but it may meet the policy objectives of the present administra-
4
tion perfectly. It has been long recognized that conditions in
which goods and services are freely available are more rewarding
to the owners of capital than conditions in which resources are
fully employed. Not only does a larger share of the national prod-
uct accrue to the owners of capital but entrepreneurs enjoy much
greater freedom of action. That is certainly the case today. The
reins of government are in the hands of people who believe in
free enterprise and encourage it to the greatest possible extent or
even beyond.
Incidentally, Japan has also found it advantageous, for different
reasons, to expand its economy at a rate that is decidedly below
its potential. Japan wants to become a great power in the world
and the way to achieve that status is not by encouraging domestic
consumption but by maintaining a high domestic savings rate that
is used first to build up productive capacity at h ~ maen d then to
acquire assets abroad. Japan has yielded to American pressure by
raising the value of its currency but it will change its domestic
economic policy only to the extent that is necessary to support
the yen.
One of the most potent reasons for expecting economic growth
to remain sluggish is that it suits the policy objectives of the two
leading countries. The constellation that seems to be emerging as
a sequence to the Imperial Circle deserves to be described as the
Golden Age of Capitalism.
It is hard to believe that the golden days of capitalism could
come back again. After all, untrammeled free enterprise has pro-
duced horrendous results in the past. Are we to repeat the same

experience again? Hopefully not. Perhaps we have learned some-
thing from past mistake$.
The fatal flaw of a free market system is its inherent instability.
The belief that financial markets are self-regulating is simply
false. Fortunately, Secretary Baker is aware of this fact and the
administration has behn to exert active economic leadership
since he moved to the Treasury. Certainly it is not laissez-faire
that has brought us to1t he threshhold of a new golden age of
capitalism but a concerted economic policy designed to counter-
act the excesses of a free market system. It remains to be seen how
well we have learned our lessons.
In any case, the benefits of the new golden age are very un-
evenly spread. It is in the nature of capitalism that the gap be-
tween winners and losers is rather wide. Large segments of the
population, especially in the financial, technology, service, and
defense sectors, are flourishing. Others, especially in the older
industries, agriculture, and the welfare sector, are suffering. For-
tunes are made in financial deals and shareholders wield more
power than at any timk in the last fifty years; at the same time,
bankruptcies are also at a fifty-year high, in both size and num-
bers. Debtor countries are wallowing in depression and a whole
continent, Africa, is starving; at the same time China is converting
to a free market system with all possible speed and the Soviet
Union is on the verge of moving in the same direction, albeit
much more cautiously.
Why the Reagan administration has been so successful in
achieving its objectives is a fascinating question. To all intents
and purposes the Democrats have been reduced to the party of
losers, as manifested by the fact that it is the Democrats who push
for protectionism in Congress, while President Reagan has an un-
questionable gift for making Americans feel like winners. But the
improvement in sentiment has been achieved at the cost of con-
siderable deterioration in the underlying reality, as manifested in
our national indebtedness.
Frankly, I have been surprised by the vitality of resurgent
capitalism. I considered the Imperial Circle as a temporary ex-
pedient that was bound to break down. Seeing it replaced by
a new arrangement that can be described as the Golden Age of
Capitalism, I must acknowledge the adaptability of the system
and its ability to survive. It remains to be seen whether policy-
makers succeed in containing its weaknesses: the inherent in-

bull market of a lifetime" that I have just articulated and partly
by more practical considerations. A cut in the discount rate may
not follow immediately upon agreement on Gramm-Rudman.
Markets are firm and the Federal Reserve is cautious. The statis-
tics for December may lbok quite good, partly because the Christ-
mas shopping season is crowded into fewer days and partly
because investment orders may be placed before the end of the
year to beat the changes' in taxation. The next advance indicators
may also look good because they include stock prices and money
supply. In these circumstances, bonds may be vulnerable and
stocks may offer better prospects on the upside. The thesis I have
just formulated is beginning to enter investors' ccneci~usnscses,
yet caution is still prevalent. The year's end is seasonally a strong
period: we could have some fireworks in the next four to five
weeks.

CONTROL PERIOD:
JANUARY1 986-JULY 1986*
SATURDAY, JANUARY 11 ,1986t
The stock and bond markets suffered a nasty break and I have
been caught badly. I had taken on my maximum exposure in the
stock market at the time of the December futures expiration-
which corresponded with a temporary market peak-and did not
dispose of my bond positions. As a consequence, I was fully ex-
posed in both bonds and stocks at the time of the break. I was
toying with the idea of cutting my bond position in half and in
fact sold about $100 million when the market dropped and I did
not feel inclined to follow it down. Subsequently, I bought back
prematurely the bonds I had sold. Only in currencies and in Eu-
ropean stocks did 3 trade correcily. I eliminated my excess curren-
cies at a moment of temporary strength so that I now have only
my equity invested in foreign currencies-with a short position
in sterling against the DM-but no leverage. I also sold into
strength in foreign stock markets so that my overall exposure
remained stable despite the rise in prices.
As usual, the break was caused by a combination of factors. The

most important was a strong employment report that convinced
the market that no discount rate cut is to be expected. The mea-
sures taken against Libya also had an unsettling effect-there
were various unconfirmed rumors about Arab selling of stocks,
bonds, and dollars. I used one of these rumors to unload my
currencies. The stock market may also have been affected by the

imposition of margin requirements on junk bonds. On Friday
afternoon, two days after the initial break, the bond market broke
through an important resistance point, 91/2% yield on 30-year
bonds, amid concern about the constitutionality of Gramm-
Rudman.
What made the market vulnerable to these developments was
the euphoria that prevailed at the time they occurred. Unfortu-
nately, I was also caught up in it. That is why the break found me
fully exposed. I regard the current episode as a typical correction
in a bull market. Its violence-a 5% drop in index futures in a
couple of hours-foreshadows what is yet to come if and when
the bull market becomes more extended.
Typically, stock market booms survive a number of tests so that
the market comes to be considered invulnerable and only then is
it ripe for the bust. We are very far from that point yet. Sentiment
is still quite cautious. All that has happened is that the market
has been disappointed in its expectation of any imminent dis-
count rate cut. The short end of the bond market has already
corrected-Eurodollar futures dropped by almost half a point; the
long end may overreact, but, if so, I expect it to swing back again
soon. As before, my position is predicated on the belief that the
economy has no real momentum. The Federal Reserve may not
lower the discount rate, but it has no reason to allow the federal
funds rate to trade up from the present level either. Equally, I
consider the constitutional challenge to Gramm-Rudman imma-
terial-the process will be working by the time the issue is de-
cided. If this view is wrong, I shall have to revise my position at
a considerable loss. Until then, I intend to hang in there. I expect
the maximum pressure in the bond market to be felt tomorrow: it
remains to be seen how much damage will be done. The stock
market ought to do better than the bond market from here on.
The trouble is that not having sold I cannot buy now. All I can
do is sit out this round and hope that the situation does not get
out of hand. My cash reserves ought to be sufficient to see me
through, but one can never be sure. The decline depletes my cash
reserves and leaves me more exposed than I was before the break.
Since I expect the break to be temporary there is no point in
raising cash now. By the same token, it would be totally unsound
to reduce my cash reserve any further.

P.S., WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 15,1986
The Group of Five are meeting this weekend. I know what I would
do in their place: I would lower interest rates on a multilateral
basis. This would shbw that the authorities are cooperating and
are in command of tlie situation. It would help maintain stability
in the foreign exchange market; without it, it may be difficult
to prevent a tempordry rise in the dollar. The ground has been
thoroughly prepared: the Gramm-Rudman process is in opera-
tion and the use of junk bonds has been curbed. Japan is wait-
ing for the United States to take the lead in lowering interest
rates. It is true that 1M"ras exceeded the target range =d the
economy has probably grown about 3%% in the fourth quarter
of 1985. If it is business as usual, there is no need to move; but
if the authorities feel the need to maintain the initiative, this is
the time to do it. Lowering the discount rate would mean
publicly abandoning monetarism; but the bond market would
accept the move because it is done in concert with other nations,
exchange rates are stable, and Volcker's reputation as a sound
money man is unscathed. The question is, does he want to do
it?
I am reluctant to believe that the authorities will do what I
would like them to. Nevertheless, I am willing to bet on it at this
time, subject to the constraints of my already exposed position.
That means that I will buy some Eurodollar futurcht; that are rela-
tively riskless. The only risk is that I become even more exposed
and must cut my exposure at the wrong time. I am willing to take
the risk because, if the bet fails, I intend to cut back my exposure
anyhow. After all, my thesis is that the authorities have taken the
initiative; if they do not maintain it, what reason do I have to
maintain a leveraged position other than a reluctance to take a
loss? There is a French military expression, reculer pour mieux
sauter. I shall do the opposite: I shall advance in order to regroup.
I shall relieve my present exposure, which I find unsustainable in
the long run, by increasing it in the short run.

the terse statement was less than enlightening. I am left to my
own devices in conjecturing about what actually happened.
I believe that the goal of reducing interest rates on a worldwide
basis was recognized, but the two truly independent central
banks, those of Germany and the United States, refused to make a
commitment to concerted action. I suspect that the Federal Re-

serve has subtly moved to ease monetary policy even before the
meeting-next ~hursdaf~ig~urse s should provide more conclu-
sive evidence-but it wants the market response to determine
when the discount rate should be cut and not a consortium of
governments. Allowing the Group of Five to dictate U.S. mone-
tary policy would conbtitute far too dangerous a precedent to be
acceptable to a central bank that wants to preserve its indepen-
dence. I
What is disturbing about the outcome is the implication of a
possible rift between Baker and Volcker. In retrospect, the dissent
between Volcker and the administration on the issue of imposing
margin requirements on junk bonds assumes gr~qtsrsi cnificance.
Volcker seems to be worried that lowering interest rates too ag-
gressively would merely fuel a stock market boom that could end
in a crash-and I would be the last person to contradict him. The
fact that he is worriea about it makes the boom less likely to
develop. In any case, the Group of Five has lost some momentum
and that is a dangerous development.
I felt it incumbent oh me to reduce the extra exposure I assumed
prior to the meeting, but I decided to wait before executing my
plan of deleveraging until the next set of Federal Reserve figures
become available. Instead of selling the Eurodollar futures I
bought, I sold some S&P 500 index futures because I considered
the stock market more. vulnerable.
In the course of the day, the decline in energy prices accelerated
until it turned into a veritable rout. By the end of the day, stocks,
bonds, and currencies have all recouped the day's losses. This
constitutes a major event. The long-awaited collapse of oil prices
is finally happening.
There is nothing to stop a free fall from developing except gov-
ernment intervention; but governments intervene only in emer-
gencies. The suspicion of a disagreement between Volcker and
Baker further weakens the chances of timely action. We are there-
fore headed for a period of maximum risk for the banking system.
What is going to happen to all the energy loans and the energy-
dependent debtor nations?
I am convinced that the situation is not going to be allowed to
get out of hand because a remedy is readily available: an import
tax on oil with special provisions for Mexico. But in order to
impose a tax, President Reagan would have to reverse himself;
only an emergency would provide him with an excuse: therefore

the situation will have to deteriorate before the remedy is applied.
It behooves me to deleverage as far as possible. The fall in oil
prices has many positive implications for both stocks and bonds,
but it would be inappropriate to speculate on them on a leveraged
basis, especially as the initial response of the market is likely to
be the same as my own.
SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 22,1986
I deleveraged too soon: I failed to take full advantage of a powerful
upsurge in both the stock and bond markets. I even got myself
short bond futures temporarily when I Lewd ha?; he l o ~ ecro urt
was going to rule against the constitutionality of Gramm-Rudman,
but the decision was delayed a week and the collapse in oil prices
outweighed everything else in importance so that I was forced to
cover with a loss. In short, my trading was poor. Nevertheless, the
fund did well, helped by our short positions in oil and the dollar.
Our stock selection has also been working for us.
The fact is, I would feel uncomfortable to be too heavily ex-
posed at the present time-that is probably why I traded poorly
when I did have a leveraged position. I look at the decline in oil
prices as a combination of two influences: an economic stimulus
and a financial shock. The markets are reacting to the first influ-
ence, while I am extremely sensitive to the second.
We are approaching the moment of truth on the international
debt issue. With oil below $15, Mexico has a prospective debt
service deficiency on the order of $10 billion. To make it up, a
number of things have to happen. Mexico must tighten its belt
further; the banks will have to take a hit; and the United States
will have to fork out some money, in the form of either grants or
price protection on Mexican oil. It can be done, but it will be a
complex and delicate operation. The concessions made by the
banks will have to be extended to other debtor countries. Money
center banks as a group are now in a position to absorb a signifi-
cant cut in interest rates on loans to the less developed countries,
but Bank of America, for one, is likely to be pushed over the
brink. It will be bailed out, along the lines of Continental
Illinois Bank, and depositors will be protected. Depositors may
not even panic, but the stock market may. The strength of the
market, combined with the amount of credit involved in futures
and options trading, makes the market extremely vulnerable to a

from the banking system to the financial markets and I would feel
very foolish if I got caught. My caution may cost me dearly, but it
will also ensure my survival.

THURSDAY, MARCH 27,1986
I have made very few macro moves since I reduced my leverage
at the end of January. In retrospect, I moved too soon because I
missed the best part of the bond market rally. Obviously I under-
estimated the bullish implications of the decline in oil prices.
Frankly, I did not think that oil would be allowed to fall so far
without government intervention. There is nothing to stop oil
from falling except government intsrvcntion, because the supply
curve is inverted: the lower the price goes, the more oil has to be
sold in order to meet the producing countries' requirements.
Eventually, domestic producers will have to be protected. That
was the reason I switched my short position from West-Texas to
Brent contracts-a move that turned out to be expensive because
I got caught in a short squeeze.
I can justify my decision to reduce leverage only on subjective
grounds. Operating on leverage involves considerable strain and
I have made enough money recently not to want to live with it.
But missing an opportunity is also painful. Fortunately I did not
miss the market: I merely failed to take maximum advantage of it.
I remained largely inactive in currencies. The only thing I did
was to build up the DM/£ cross position further. I recognized that
the nature of the currency markets was, once again, changing: the
spirit of cooperation that emerged from the first Group of Five
meeting was weakened in the second and the authorities were
losing control over the market. The dollai -was moving faster and
lower than the authorities desired. Both the Japanese and the
Germans were getting worried. The American authorities were
divided: Volcker shared their concern while the rest of the admin-
istration felt that the Japanese squirming was a welcome sign that
the lower dollar was beginning to bite. The dollar was falling of
its own momentum and it was not clear what caused the decline:
the fall in oil prices must have had something to do with it. Part
of the impact was nonrecurring-fewer dollars were needed to
finance oil transactions-but the trend was pronounced enough
to attract speculative positions.
I kept my short position in the dollar intact not because I had
any great convictions but because I had no firm views and I felt

that my chances of making money by trading currencies did not
justify the trouble and aggravation. Holding the position was
more comfortable than changing it and my lack of convictions put
me in a good position to reassess the situation when necessary.
Then came Preston Martin's resignation and the behind-the-
scenes struggle over interest rates came out into the open. The

market responded with a sharp rally in the dollar. Sterling also
rallied against the DM and I was facing a big loss in currencies-
the first since the inception of dirty floating. It forced me to reas-
sess the macroeconomic situation.
What I find is continued economic stagnation. Elements of
strength and weakness are well balanced. The strength comes
mainly from lower interest rates and the optimism generated by
improving profit margins; housing, restocking, new business for-
mation, increased employment in the service sector are also pos-
itive influences. The major source of weakness is in the oil
industry. Oil is a major component in capital spending and prob-
ably equals in importance the automobile industry. Other forms
of capital spending are also weak, although they can be expected
to improve with the passage of time. Another source of weakness,
the reduced budget deficit, has not yet had time to make its impact
felt. The savings rate seems to be improving, keeping consumer
spending in check. Investors are responding to lower interest
rates by moving into stocks and long-term bonds. All this is very
bullish, both for bonds and stocks.
In view of the soft economy, I see no reason to cut my short
position in the dollar. Rather, I take the current strength of the
dollar as a reason to expect interest rates to fall further. Accord-
ingly, I have decided to reestablish my long position in bonds. To
buy bonds on a 71/2% yield basis when I sold them with a 9 to
9%% yield is not an easy decision to make; but the logic of the
situation forces me into it. It is inconsistent to be short dollars
without being long bonds-and I think it would be wrong to buy
dollars now. What about the leverage involved? After all, it was
the reluctance to carry leverage that induced me to reduce my
exposure in the first place. Undoubtedly, it increases the tension,
but by the same token it relieves the tension that was inherent in
being short dollars without being long bonds. I shall have to cope
by being more alert.
What are the prospects for a significant setback in both stocks
and bonds? When I look at the internal dynamism of the market,
I find that the boom is far too young and vigorous to collapse of
its own weight. Investors are still very cautious, including myself.
Stocks are just on the verge of becoming too expensive for lever-
aged buyouts, and the real rate of interest is still too high, given
the collapse in oil prices. Either the dollar or interest rates have
to decline, or both. Since the dollar has stabilized, it is interest
rates that have to move further.

On internal grounds alone, the boom has a long way to go: stock
prices could double or more before they become vulnerable. Some
of the smaller stock markets are far more exposed. Italy is a case
in point. If and when we have a crash it ought to affect Italy before
it affects the United States.
At present, the only hanger is an external shock. Its potential
origin is clearly visible; oil prices are set on a collision course.
Oil will continue falling until it sets off some catastrophic event
that will arrest or reverse the trend. We may distinguish between
the two kinds of cathartic events: military and financial.
Militarylpolitical developments are notoriously difficult to an-
ticipate. Tensions in the Middle Eaet are rising. We have had a
near-revolution in Egypt; the Iran-Iraq war shows signs of escalat-
ing; the incursion of the American fleet into the Bay of Sidra
passed off without serious repercussions, but we can expect other
incidents. Since they cannot be anticipated, all I can do is stay
alert. A mild degree of leverage serves to heighten awareness.
The financial repercussions of lower oil prices are much more
obvious. Mexico, in p&ticular, is an event waiting to happen.
Will it be an orderly bailout or a confrontation? Mexico has
backed down from asking for interest rate concessions. The like-
lihood is that some kind of oil-denominated security will be of-
fered to disguise the concession that Mexico needs and to prevent
it from spreading to other debtor countries.
What is more difficult to fathom is the reaction &the markets.
An orderly settlement would reinforce the bullish trend, but
doubts about an orderly settlement would test the market. At
present, the odds are that the market will pass the test, but it
would be best not to be exposed while the issus is decided.
SUNDAY, APRIL 6,1986 *
Last Tuesday, I shorted the S&Pf utures in an amount equal to my
long position in bonds. This has effectively eliminated my lever-
aged exposure on the long side. I am now looking for the right
entry point for increasing my short position, so as to reduce my
net exposure even further.

$100 million in face value of &year Treasury Notes are equivalent to $28.5 million in market
value of 30-year Government Bonds.

why should Saudi Arabia take the risk of a makeshift solution?
The United States is the high-cost producer; by staying the course,
U.S. production can be permanently reduced. It was to be ex-
pected that U.S. production would be protected, but recent events
reduced that possibility. I expect the pressure on oil prices to
,
continue. I
Declining oil prices are bullish until they turn bearish. Strange
as it may seem, most fdrecasts have failed to take into account the
reduction in U.S. oil production. Instead of stimulating the econ-
omy, the initial impact is negative. Altogether, the economy
seems weaker than prevailing expectations. That is why I am un-
willing to reduce my short position in the dollar. In fact, I intend
to increase it by covering my short position in sterling. I seem to
have overstayed my welcome. The interest rate differential is at-
tracting funds to sterling and I do not have a strong enough case
to fight the trend.
I am happy with the cross position I have established, long
bondslshort S&P futures, but I am less happy with my net long
position in stocks. I am looking for an opportunity to reduce the
exposure. I do not expect a collapse, but a correction of undeter-
mined magnitude. The right entry point will be when oil prices
start declining again. The initial response ought to be positive, for
both bonds and stocks. It may come only after the April 15 meet-
ing of OPEC.

WEDNESDAY, APRIL 9,1986
The market flip-flopped in the last two days and so did I. On
Monday, oil rallied sharply, arid bonds, stocks, and currencies
sold off; on Tuesday, all these markets reversed themselves. The
move on Monday hurt me on all fronts. I discovered how sensitive
my portfolio was to oil prices; I also discovered that there was
more leverage in it than I thought. I had neglected my DM/£ cross
position, which turned against me with a vengeance. To quantify
it, I dropped a cool $100 million from the onset of the correction,
despite my S&Pf utures hedge, which saved me some $20 million.
On Monday, I cut both my DM/£ exposure and my short posi-
tion in oil in half and covered 40% of my S&Ps hort; on Tuesday,
I covered the rest of my S&P short and did some bargain hunting
in stocks. The net effect is that I increased my exposure in stocks
and bonds while I reduced it in currencies and oil.
Based on information received Monday morning, I modified my

short-term outlook on oil. Two positives came to my attention:
the likelihood that motorists would use more gasoline this sum-
mer, especially with the impact that terrorism is making on for-
eign air travel, and the probability that oil companies will shut
down their North Sea oil production for extended maintenance
because they can make almost as much money on their net-back

agreements with Saudi Arabia. There is therefore room for a trad-
ing rally prior to the OPEC meeting next week. By buying Brent, I
am setting up a cross position of Brent vs. WTI (domestic oil).
With the prospect of import duties receding, this makes sense to
me.
I have no particular Giews on sterling. It is now reacting to the
favorable interest rate differential, rather than to the price of oil.
As it strengthens, the interest rate differential will be reduced
because the government cannot allow sterling to appreciate. This
limits the upside potential for sterling, but that is not a good
reason for staying short, The plain fact is, I neglected the position
and failed to take my profit; now I must disengage myself without
a profit. I liquidated half my position immediately and hoped to
do the rest at more favorable prices. The U.K. lending rate was in
fact cut by 1/2% on Tuesday, touching off the rally in U.S. stocks
and bonds.
The stock and bond markets reacted negatively to the rise in oil
prices, but it has made me more bullish. The real danger, in my
view, is a further fall. I'regard the decline as a healthy correction
in a bull market and a buying opportunity that I decided to exploit
within the limits of prudence. I am now fully extended.
The ploy seems to be working. The underlying weakness in the
economy is now gaining recognition and there is a meeting of the
minds on further coordinated interest rate reductions. The expec-
tation is strong enough to overshadow concern abut Libya al-
though U.S. retaliation is almost inevitable.
After a period of increased activity I hope to sit back again. I
want to reduce the leverage, but not too soon. I should like to let
the profits run for a wkile.
WEDNESDAY, MAY 21,1986
I remained rather inactive in April and what little I did served to
reduce my exposure. I sold a small amount of stocks, a larger
amount of currencies, and almost my entire bond position. At the
beginning of May, I became more active. I made a foray into bonds
at the time of the quarterly refunding, which looked promising at
first but turned very sour afterward. I took my loss early, but as
the bonds continued to fall, I began to accumulate a position
again. On the other hand, I took a significant short position in S&P
futures, so that I now have a slight negative exposure in stocks

that more or less balances my positive exposure in bonds. I have
also built up a short position in oil in a rising market, which is
currently showing a loss. Furthermore, I am in the process of
building up a short position in gold. All told, my trading activity
cost me some money but it has put me in a position in which I
feel comfortable. My aim is to limit my losses rather than to make
a lot of money.

The outlook for the dollar is quite uncertain; a half-and-half
position seems safest. The decline of the dollar has gone further
than the authorities intended; there is also a greater degree of
dissent among the major powers than I like to see. Moreover, the
Federal Reserve, which is still laboring under the influence of
monetarism, expects the economy to pick up in the second half.
All this is serving to rkduce the likelihood of further interest rate
reductions.

MONDAY, JULY 21,1986: END OF THE CONTROL PERIOD
1 have made my first major strategic change since the end of the
real-time experiment. Without abandoning the thesis that we are
in "the bull market of a lifetime," I have adopted a new thesis,
namely, that the bull market may be cut short by a deflationary
spiral engendered by the collapse of oil prices. The second hy-
pothesis will be tested in the next few months; if we survive the
test, the case for "the bull market of a lifetime" will remain intact
-indeed, its lifespan will be extended. Thus, for the near future
I shall operate with two contradictory theses. This is a suitable
subject for another real-time experiment; therefore, I shall wind
up the control period at this point.
I have done very little outside my equity portfolio since the last
report. My major move was in currencies and it was a costly one.
First, I covered my entire short position in the dollar and then I
reestablished a fully hedged position at lower Izvels. My first
move was triggered by some signs that the U.S. economy may be
strengthening: the advance indicators and the purchasing agents'
report for May were deceptively strong. I had no firm t~iewsa n
the currencies, and I did not feel like losing my accumulated
profits. I figured that, with a dollar-denominated fund, being in
dollars can just as easily be called neutral as being half in and
half out. Needless to say, I covered close to the top of the trading
range.
The fact is that it is very difficult to maintain a "neutral" posi-
tion in a fluctuating currency market. Market participants have an
existential choice to make and if they have no clear views they
are bound to make the wrong choice. One can, of course, neutral-
ize one's position by buying currency options, but, in that case,
one has to pay a measurable cost for neutrality. In the last few
months of the control period I was not as much in touch with the
markets as during the period of the experiment itself. I was work-

ing on the more theoretical sections of this book and spent May
and June in Europe. The macro moves I made during the control
period have reflected this: they added very little to the overall
results; if I take the currency trading into account, the net contri-
bution was negative. As the following table indicates, the bulk of
the profits came from the equity side.

To discuss the composition of the equity portfolio in detail
would take us too far'afield, but it is worth pointing out that at
least two major investment themes, one relating to Finnish shares
and the other to Japanese railroad and real estate shares, are
closely related to the concept of "the bull market of a lifetime."
The real estate concept also extends to Hong Kong. Taken to-
gether, these investments account for more than two-thirds of my
equity positions outside the U.S., and 40% of my entire equity
positions.
Whether "the bull market of a lifetime" will survive the next
few months will be the subject of a new experiment; whatever the
outcome, the thesis has stood me in good stead in managing my
investment fund up to this point. I hope that reopening the exper-
iment will help to focus my mind in the same way as it did last
time.

PHASE 2: JULY 1986-NOVEMBER 1986
MONDAY,J ULY 21,1986 *
1 The possibility of a deflationary spiral has never been far from my
thoughts. Indeed, it was the thesis that was uppermost in my
mind when I started the real-time experiment. Eventually I dis-
carded it in favor of a bull market thesis, but I kept on considering
it and occasionally acted on it during the control period.
The thesis, as I see it at present, rests on the collapse in oil
prices. In the long run, lower oil prices ought to stimulate the
economy because they reduce production costs and enhance dis-
posable income. The effect is similar to a tax cut, with the addi-
tional advantage that it comes at the expense of OPEC and not of
the U.S. Treasury. But in the short run, the impact is negative.
First, there is a direct hit against oil production and exploration
expenditure. Even more important, when producers' prices are
falling, there is a powerful inducement to delay purchases. With
nominal interest around 7% in the U.S. and 4% in Japan, while
producers' prices are dropping at an 8%% rate in the U.S. and
even faster in Japan, what can be better than building up cash
balances, preferably in Japanese yen? The deflationary effect is
supposed to be temporary, because purchases cannot be delayed
forever, especially if consumer demand, stimulated by lower in-
terest rates and lower prices, picks up. But while it lasts, there is
a danger that the burden of accumulated debt will come crashing
down, obliterating the prospect of an eventual pickup in demand.

tary reorganization provides the paradigm. Operating under the
protection of the courts, LTV Corp. can lower its costs structure
and compete more effectively until Bethlehem Steel is also
pushed into bankruptcy and eventually the whole industry goes
broke. While the drama is acted out, customers are likely to order
from hand to mouth. The scenario is a dramatization of what goes
on, in one form or another, in many sectors of the economy. Texas
and other ~il-~roducrieng~io ns are rapidly turning into disaster
areas. The tax reform bill threatens to destroy the market for com-
mercial real estate; it also weakens an already weak capital goods
sector. Agriculture is in the depth of a depression, and defense
spending, which has been one af the driving forces irz the econ-
omy, is on the decline. Consumer spending remains the last major
source of strength. If consumer confidence is shaken, final de-
mand may never pick up as it is supposed to. As Keynes said, in
the long run we are all'dead.
The situation is exacerbated by instability in the currency mar-
kets. The decline in the dollar greatly reduces the scope for mon-
etary stimulation. ~he'~ros~foerc at v icious circle developing in
which a weak economy and a weak dollar become mutually self-
reinforcing is greater now than at any time since the inception of
the real-time experiment.
The combination of a near-term negative and a long-term posi-
tive impact is called a J curve. The term is usually used in con-
nection with currencies, but it can also be appliew oil prices. It
depicts the effects of a one-time fall in value. If the depreciation
is continuous, the downward slope of the J curve is extended
until it becomes more appropriate to speak of a slippery slope
than a J curve.
I have been aware of the dangers inherent in the collapse of oil
prices long before the markets began to recognize them and I have
been lulled into a false sense of security by the fact that the mar-
kets continued to ignore them. Indeed, I was more preoccupied
with possible signs of a pickup until recent market action gave
me a rude reminder. When the stock market went into a tailspin
on July 7, my first reaction was to treat it as a typical technical
correction in a bull market which in this case seems to occur at
the beginning of each quarter. I realized that we are in a situation
where any break in the stock market could be self-validating; still,
I found it difficult to believe that the break would come exactly
when the market was due for a technical correction. Moreover, it

would be most unusual for the turn to be called correctly by a
4 majority of technical analysts. Only a week later, when the de-
cline exceeded the bounds of a technical correction, did I take it
seriously.
I accept the bearish thesis not as a valid prediction of what is
in store for us but as a potent influence in financial markets. At
the same time, I see no reason to abandon the bullish thesis. On
the contrary, if it survives the severe test it is currently subjected
to it will be reinforced and its life span extended. Thus I find
myself in the awkward position of having to operate with two
contradictory theses, at least in the short run. The bearish thesis
is the more potent rightnow, but 1 cannot ciaim to have acted
upon it either in anticipation or at inception. Thus, there is a
danger that I act upon it just as its influence in the market be-
1
comes fully felt-in other words, I sell at the bottom.
I have found myself in similar situations often before and I have
developed certain techniques for dealing with them. Indeed, it is
more usual for me to operate with two at least partially contradic-
tory theses than to stake everything on one thesis as I did at the
end of Phase 1.
As a general principle, I do not dismantle positions that are
built on a thesis that remains valid; rather, I take additional posi-
tions in the opposite direction on the basis of the new thesis. The
result is a delicate balance that needs to be adjusted from moment
to moment. If the balancing act fails to protect the portfolio, I have
to cut back all around in order to assure survival. If the balancing
act is successful, I gain liquidity without having to sacrifice desir-
able positions. To illustrate: if I start with a fully invested position
and then sell short an equal amount, a 20% decline, even if it
affects the longs and the shorts equally, leaves me only 80% in-
vested on the long side. If I cover my shorts at the right time, I
come out way ahead, but even if I cover my shorts with a loss I
am better off than if I had sold my longs at the wrong time. In
practice, the operation is much more complex because the balanc-
ing act is not confined to the stock market.
Take the present case.* I reacted rather late. The break was
already a week old, and the market was 5% off its peak when I
* Again, readers not particularly interested in my market maneuvers are advised

which analyzes an interesting boomlbust sequence in the Japanese stock market.

Phase 2: July 1986-November 1986 239
started to move. On Monday, July 14, I actually bought some S&P
futures on the argument that, if we are dealing with a technical
reaction, the market ought to close higher. The Dow had dropped
63 points the previous Monday, July 7, and the bears would ex-
pect another sharp drop: on the subsequent Monday to establish a
cascade-like bear market. When the market did in fact close lower,
I reversed myself on the;f ollowing day and by the end of the week
I built up a short position that probably outweighs my long posi-
tions. I also shorted some long bonds and went long some T-bill
futures. Then I piled into the Japanese bond future market, and
doubled up on my short position in U.S. government bonds. The
idea behind these maneuvers is that eventually i expect conc~rtzd
action to reduce interest rates but, with the dollar declining, U.S.
bonds may react negatively while Japanese bonds would move
up. The day-by-day evolution of the portfolio structure is shown
p.
in the tables following 249.
I am now in the position I wish to be in, but my posture is liable
to change from minute to minute. I shall have to be much more
active and nimble than I had been hitherto until the battle be-
tween the two conflicting theses is resolved. For instance, I cov-
ered 500 S&P futures contracts today (Monday, July 21) in order
to be able to sell more at higher prices if and when the disappoint-
ment that the "cascade" did not continue precipitated a short-
covering rally.
Which way I shall move next will be dictated bythe outcome
of the OPEC meeting starting next Monday. If it breaks down, I
shall prepare for the worst; if, against all prevailing expectations,
it manages to reach an agreement, I shall have to reassess the
situation.
MONDAY EVENING, JULY 28,1986
It is difficult to give a blow-by-blow account of my maneuvering.
To summarize my activities last week: I reduced my short posi-
tion in S&P futures to 5000 contracts ($587 million) at a modest
loss; I covered part of my short position in U.S. government bond
futures at a modest profit; and I also took a profit on a portion of
my most recently acquired dollar short positions. The net effect
is to reduce my risk marginally all around and to put me in what
I believe to be a fully hedged position.
Today, Monday, I took my profit on the balance of my short

position in U.S. government bond futures. Then the dollar fell to
new lows for some unexplained reason and I felt obliged to jump
off the fence on the bearish side. I was part of the crowd dumping
bonds and stock index futures. I sold out the S&P index futures I
had bought back at higher prices the week before, as well as the
bond futures I had covered at higher prices earlier this morning.

Phase 2: July 1986-November 1986 241
It was not clear to me whether the markets were anticipating a
positive or a negative cohclusion to the OPEC meeting; all I could
see was that the dollar was falling for whatever reason and that
was bearish for bonds and stocks. A market move that has no clear
explanation can be all the more scary. I decided to act first and to
look for an explanation 'later. I shall reexamine the situation to-
morrow and, if necessary, reverse today's moves.
THURSDAY EVENING, JULY 31,1986
On Tuesday, I took a modest profit on the S&P futures I had sold
on Monday and I also covered my bond futures to sell part
OG!~
of them out again at higher prices.
On Wednesday, the stock market made a modest new low. I
tried to cover more S&Pf utures but the futures market rallied and
I got only 1100 contracts done. I also continued to short into a
rising oil market.
This morning, the dollar made new lows and I intend to get
back into a more bearish position in stock index futures. It seems
that the OPEC meeting has not succeeded in more than papering
over the differences. The next move in oil should be down. This
was the signal I was waiting for in deciding which way to get off
the fence.
The case for a recession also seems to be getting stronger. Be-
yond the short-term case based on a deflationary spiral there is
also a long-term case based on a decline in capital spending. The
instability of financial markets provides a powerful disincentive
to fixed capital formation all over the world. In the U.S., tax re-
form adds to the uncertainties; ifi Europe and Japan, the desline
of the dollar puts downward pressure on profit margins. The trou-
ble is that the governments have much less leeway than usual to
embark on countercyclical policies. This is particularly true of
the U.S., which is hemmed in by the need to maintain the confi-
dence of foreign investors. Japan and Europe could do more, but
they are moving slowly. In the meantime, the weight of accumu-
lated debt is pressing: Bethlehem Steel suspended dividend pay-
ments on its preferred stock.
The downside seems open-ended, the upside limited. After yes-
terday's rally, the stock market is still in a mold that would fit a
normal technical correction; today may be the day to break the
mold. If this is true, my actions will undoubtedly contribute to it.

The short position I took on last Thursday seemed to be working:

come to some kind of agreement and I tried to cover half my short
position. Then the details of a deal began to filter through and the
stock market rallied. I managed to cover only a quarter of my short
position. I realized a modest profit on the completed transaction
but I have an unrealized loss on the part I failed to cover. My
present inclination is to take the loss, because the bearish case

has been undermined by today's deal on oil quotas. The fact that
Iran and Saudi Arabia came to terms is highly significant: it indi-
cates that it is not in Saudi Arabia's political and military interest
to see the price of oil go any lower. The deal may come apart, but
that can happen only later. In the meantime, it does not make
sense to be short in either oil or stocks. Unfortunately, I am short
in both. I want to disengage myself, but I may have to be patient:
there are many others in my position and after the first rally there
may be room for second thoughts. One way or another, I have to
be prepared to take a loss.
SATURDAY, AUGUST 9,1986
I have reduced my exposure all around in the course of the week.
On Tuesday, I covered my short positions in index futures and
oil and bank stocks; I also sold some of my currencies and short-
term bonds. On Wednesday, after the first wave of short covering
receded, I started covering my short positions in oil. On Thurs-
day, I covered my short position in bond futures. Today, I sold
the bulk of my currencies.
The only major positions I am left with are in stocks and in
Japanese bond futures. The only new exposure I took on is a short
position in U.S. government bond futures. This was a tactical
move I made today after a sharp short-covering rally and it is
hedged in a way by my Japanese bond futures.
The asset value of the Fund suffered its first setback since the
beginning of January: the value of the shares dropped by 4.2% in
the course of the week. The losses came primarily from the oil
gamble and from some sf my stock posiiiuns. The change in the
market environment has finally caught up with us: several of our
stock investment concepts were punctured and, without a suc-
cessful hedging operation, our asset value suffered. We have prob-
ably not yet experienced the negative impact to the full extent:
usually everything that can go wrong does so at the same time.
That is why I prefer to retrench all around when things begin to
go wrong. Two weeks of hectic activity produced no tangible re-
sults: it is time to become more quiescent. I am still too much
involved in the day-to-day movements of the market, but I shall
try to regain my perspective. With reduced exposure, I can reas-
sess and regroup more easily.
I accept the OPEC agreement as a major event. The oil-produc-

ing countries went to the edge of the abyss and recoiled: they are
likely to stay away from the abyss for some time. The inverse
supply curve for oil works in both directions: once the price of
oil rises, the pressure to pump oil at any price is diminished. In
short, the oil cartel gained a new lease on life. Its duration is
uncertain, but it is bound to be long enough to base my invest-

ment decisions on it. I expect oil prices not below $15 and more
likely $18 by the end of the year.
Where does that leave me? My negative scenario was predicated
on the collapse of oil; should I abandon it and turn unreservedly
bullish again? That was my first reaction but I am held back be-
cause I am aware of too many negatives. Having passed one hur-
dle, namely, oil, there are others behind it. The most important is
the weakness of the dollar. I prefer to remain cautious until the
dollar is stabilized.
In casting around for a negative case I find myself returning
to the argument I started with at the beginning of the real-time
experiment. At that time, the Imperial Circle was unwinding
and there was a danger it would start spinning in the opposite
direction: a weak economy would produce a weak dollar and
prevent a decline in interest rates. Both the economy and the
dollar are weak enough to render this scenario realistic. What
is there to prevent it? I believe only the realization of the danger
will save us. The stock market is telling us that we are heading
into a recession; the weight of bad debt is accumulating; and
protectionist pressures have reached such a point that Congress
fell only a few votes short of overriding a presidential veto on
the subject. The authorities must realize that something has to
be done. They had managed to forge a consensus once before,
at the Plaza Group of Five meeting. Under the pressure of cir-
cumstances it would not be so difficult to do it again. Japan and
Germany could lower their interest rates, and the United States
could cooperate in supporting the dollar. Volcker flew off to
Emminger's funeral in Germany over the weekend and I have
no doubt the subject will be discussed. That is why I sold my
currencies yesterday. Shorting U.S. bond futures makes less
sense, except as a hedge. If the dollar continues to make new
lows, I intend to build up the position as a replacement for my
short position in the dollar; if the dollar stabilizes I can go
long in stock index futures against it. In any case, I can offset
my short position in U.S. bonds against my long position in Jap-
anese bond futures.
In sum, I continue to operate with two alternative scenarios,
but, instead of oil, the dollar has become the critical variable.
If the authorities succeed in stabilizing the dollar, I shall back
the bullish scenario more confidently; if they fail, the vicious
circle looms. At present, I am willing to bet on a positive reso-

lution, but only cautiously. Having surmounted one hurdle, we
ought to be able to pass the next one. But if covering my dollar
positions turns out to be a mistake I shall have to either en-
gage in some fancy footwork or take it on the chin. Given the
futility of my hedging1e xercise to date, I shall probably opt for
the latter. After all, I hdve no leverage left in the portfolio to worry
about.
I
MONDAY EVENING, AUGUST 18,1986
The stock market has ,turned in a very strong performance, the
bond market has also ~emainedf irm, and the currencies seem to
have stabilized. The asset value of the fund reached a new high. I
am now ready to opt for the bullish scenario with greater confi-
dence.
We have been to the 'brink and we are in the process of pulling
back from it. The groundwork has been laid for a coordinated
reduction in interest rates. With oil prices rising we are heading
for a period of inventory accumulation. With currencies stabiliz-
ing, the beneficial effects of the decline in the value of the dollar
will begin to be felt. These short-term positives should outweigh
the long-term negatives such as the downturn in construction and
the weakness in capital spending. The net result should be a con-
tinuation of the substandard growth we have been experiencing.
Against this background, the stock markets of the wsrld may con-
tinue to reach new heights. The tax reform bill may exercise a
dampening influence for the rest of this year because both long-
term capital gains and short-term losses will have more favorable
tax treatment this year than next; but this consideration may be
already reflected in the market. Professional investors have raised
a lot of cash and done a lot of hedging. If there is going to be a
surprise it will be on the upside. This is quite a turnabout from a
few weeks ago when I felt that the upside was limited and the
downside open-ended.
I am now ready to conclude Phase 2 of the experiment. Instead
of a turning point, it turned out to be an interlude in what I still
consider a bull market. I shall revert to a more leisurely style of
management and less frequent reviews. The Fund is well posi-
tioned, although I would be happier with a somewhat larger long
position in stocks and, to be adventurous, with a long position in
oil.

sharply. I ignored the sell-off and by Thursday I seemed to be
justified: the Dow Jones made a new high. But the other indexes
did not follow, and the whole market weakened on Friday. There
has been a change in leadership: cyclical and oil stocks have come
to the fore, but the old leadership, where investors have large
profits, is acting poorlj. I believe the tax bill is responsible: the
tax rate on long-term capital gains is going to be higher next year.

258 The Real-Time Experiment
The market is also concerned about inflation. My strategic view
I has not changed: if the authorities can coordinate their policies,
we ought to have continued subdued growth. I am encouraged by
the relative stability of the dollar. Nevertheless, it seems that the
stock market needs to test the downside. At present, I don't expect
much more than, say, 40 points on the Dow Jones. Nevertheless, I

Phase 2: July 3986-November 3986 259
decided to cut my position in S&P futures in half, in order to
retain the initiative.
A setback in Japanese stocks and bonds is hurting, but there is
nothing to be done about it.
THURSDAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 11 ,1986
I have decided to move into a more neutral position. That means
selling out the rest of my S&P futures, and perhaps even going
short against my stock positions, or building up my small short
position in government bonds. I have also decided to short the
dollar, mainly against the DM.
I expect the U.S. economy to show strength in the third quarter,
and my information is that the German economy showed a strong
pickup in the second quarter. The groundwork has been laid be-
tween the U.S. and Japan for a concerted reduction in interest
rates in exchange for a concerted move to stabilize the dollar, and
I believe that Germany would join, albeit reluctantly. Given the
momentary strength, I believe the button will not be pushed until
and unless a renewed attack on the dollar would force the hand
of the authorities. It is to hedge against that possibility that I am
buying DM. I could, of course, lose both on the DM and on Japa-
nese bonds, if the dollar continues to strengthen; but I consider
the risk modest.
The stock market is increasingly dominated bflaX considera-
tions. These are difficult to read but I believe that on balance the
pressure will be on the downside for the next few months, setting
up for a strong year-end rally. Where I have no strong convictions,
I want to reduce my exposure.
SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 13,1986
The last two days' sharp sell-off found me unprepared. I com-
pleted the program I set for myself before the opening on Thurs-
day, but obviously that was not enough to protect the port-
folio: we are suffering a major setback. I am reluctant to make
any further moves because they could easily compound the dam-
age. Our exposure is not excessive: I do not need to retrench
immediately. On the other hand, I have very little ammunition
for further engagement. I intend to do as little as possible.

This is in sharp contrast with the July/August break, which I
managed to dodge successfully, In a sense, I was faked out by
that break. Hedging against it left me emotionally exhausted,
and when the more severe break came I was asleep at the
switch.
In retrospect I should have realized that the tax reform bill
could dislocate the market, coming at a time when the market was

consolidating anyhow. The inducement to sell first and buy back
later was just about irresistible. The question now is: How far and
how fast will the market decline? The figure to watch is mutual
fund redemptions. Interestingly, I do not feel that the downside
is as open-ended as it was in July: whatever lows we reach in the
next three months will set the stage for a strong year-end rally,
which I believe will carry prices above today's levels.

Phase 2: July 1986-November 1986 263
the next configuration? The question is very similar to the one I
asked at the beginning of the real-time experiment: what is going
to be the outcome of the Imperial Circle? Indeed, the question
could be phrased differently: is the "Golden Age of Capitalism"
an enduring phenomenon or is it merely a temporary expedient
that has run its course? '
Many signs point to the latter alternative. I shall mention only
a few: the steepening of the yield curve; the rise of gold; and the
disarray in the Group of Five process. The stock market also
shows signs of a major top, although it has not quite reached the
state of euphoria that one would expect from "the bull market of
a iifetime"; in other wards, the bubble is not yet ripe for bursting,
That is, in fact, the main reason why I have been so reluctant to
recognize the topping action and preferred to think in terms of a
technical correction. It is by no means certain that the bull market
is over, but the break bas been too severe to treat it as part of an
ongoing bull market. It is better to declare the phase I have called
the "Golden Age of Capitalism" as complete and to try to identify
the next phase. Even if 'it turns out to be a new phase in the "bull
market of a lifetime," it is bound to have so many different fea-
tures as to justify giving it a different name. I am quite uncertain
at present how the situation will unfold. By declaring it a new
phase, even if it turns out to be a continuation of the old one, I
avoid getting frozen into an inappropriate mold and force myself
to maintain an open mind. It is far too early to cow to any defi-
nite conclusions.
The previous phase was based on international cooperation
that has made a controlled descent of the dollar and a coordinated
reducrion in interest rates possible.
The world economy remained sluggish so that monetary stim-
ulation led to a big bull market in financial assets. The increasing
disparity between the "real" and the "financial" economies of the
world created strains that threaten to undermine international
cooperation and require a new departure if a breakdown is to be
avoided. Unfortunately, there are no signs of new policy initia-
tives, only squabbling among the allies. It is far too early to pre-
dict how the impasse will be resolved. I can see three major
possibilities:
1. Muddling through: The J curve finally begins to work, providing
some impetus to the U.S. economy while weakening our major
trading partners. The world economy remains sluggish and mon-



==================================================
                     PAGE 275                     
==================================================

264 The Real-Time Experiment
etary policy accommodating. Once it becomes clear that the dis-
1 integration of the international trading and financial system has
been avoided, confidence returns and the tremendous liquidity
that has accumulated is once again invested in financial assets. If
so, we may yet see "the bull market of a lifetime."
2. A vicious circle. A weak economy and a weak dollar reinforce
each other to produce higher interest rates and higher budget def-
icits. Protectionism gains the upper hand and it provokes retalia-
tion, including debt repudiation.
3. New policy initiatives. Under pressure from the financial markets
(a falling dollar, falling bond and stock markets, and rising gold
prices) the authorities get their act together. The dollar is stabilized
at the same time as there is another rouna of interesr rate reduc-
tions. The U.S.a nd the Soviet Union agree on a disarmament pact,
allowing the military budget to be cut. International debt is finally
recognized as a political problem and steps are taken to stimulate
the economies of less developed countries.
Since the emergence of a vicious circle is bound to evoke a
policy response, we may distinguish between two main alterna-
tives: muddling through and a vicious circle followed by new
policy initiatives. The actual course of events is likely to combine
elements of both. Either way, financial markets are likely to re-
main under pressure in the near term.
After the OPEC meeting I made a bet that the quarrel between
the United States and Germany will be patched up and we shall
muddle through. I have started to hedge my bet recently; never-
theless, the outcome of the latest Group of Five meeting has
proven me wrong. I intend to react to it vigorously.
I can understand how the impasse was reached. Baker needed
a scapegoat and the Germans refused to be cast in the role. The
elements of a deal were clearly visible: a U.S. commitment to
stabilize the dollar in exchange for a German commitment to
lower interest rates. I have the impression that it was Baker who
balked. If so, it betrays the weakness of his position: he cannot
agree to stabilize the dollar before the November elections be-
cause he has nothing else to offer to fend off protectionist pres-
sures. There is plenty of time till the elections for the financial
markets to elicit a more adequate policy response. I intend to do
my share: I plan to increase my DM position by $500 million, my
short position in U.S. government bonds from $180 to $500 mil-
lion, and my stock index futures short position from $275 million

to $750 million. I also want to go long $150 million in gold. The
downside seems more open-ended then only a few weeks ago: by
the time the policy disagreements are resolved a vicious circle
may well be under way.

266 The Real-Time Experiment
One tactical mistake begets another: everything I did on Monday,
4 with the exception of the DM purchase, was wrong. I do not min-
imize the importance of the pre-summit meeting announced yes-
terday, but I must be careful not to embark on a vicious circle of
my own. For the time being, I shall sit tight. Although I have lost
money getting there, I believe my portfolio is reasonably well
balanced. If so, I am prepared to sit out a rally in stocks and
bonds, especially as I am going to China for a month.
WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 22,1986
I cut my trip to China short because I was worried about the
Japanese portion of the portfolio. I am now on my way back to
4
New York after spending a day in Tokyo.
The decline in the Japanese stock market has turned into a
veritable rout in the last few days. The market as a whole has
dropped by some 15% but the stocks that I own, which are
all real estate related, are off 25-40% from their recent highs.
The bond market, where I have a large exposure, has also been
weak.
Now that I have focused on it, I realize what is happening. The
appreciation of the yen has gone too far: Japan is losing out to the
newly industrialized couhtries of the Pacific Basin and exporting
companies are hurting badly. An easy money policy is not enough
to cope with the situation; indeed, it has become counterproduc-
tive by engendering a speculative boom that is bound to end in a
bust. Recognizing this, the authorities have decided to relieve the
upward pressure on the yen by actively encouraging capital out-
flows rather than by lowering interest rates any further. The pol-
icy succeeded, the yen has stabilized, and the market has
collapsed.
I have been an active participant in one of the classic boom1
bust sequences in history and I failed to get out in time. I am now
badly caught. It is clear that I ought to get out of the market, but
how and when? I don't know what to do because my knowledge
of the Japanese market is extremely limited. I expect to pay a
heavy price for my ignorance.
I find it somewhat embarrassing to get caught in the "bust
of our lifetime" while writing about the "boom of our lifetime."
Yet that is what has happened. I believe the collapse of the

Japanese stock market will prove to be one of the landmarks of
contemporary financial history. It resembles a classic crash
more closely than anything we are likely to witness in our
own market. The Japanese market has become grossly overvalued
and complacency has become pervasive, as my own behavior
testifies. Governor Satoshi Sumita of the Bank of Japan issued

268 The Real-Time Experiment
repeated warnings, but the market ignored it. I now hear that unit
I trusts were verbally guaranteeing 9% returns to investors-
an unsound practice if ever there was one. I should have no-
ticed these signs of speculative excess, but I failed to pay
attention.
My only excuse is that I do not have a permanent presence in
Japan: my previous foray was fifteen years ago. At that time I was
a broker advising foreign investors; as a consequence I had the
inside track, and I got out unscathed. Now I am a foreign investor,
and my fate is typical of the occasional investor from abroad who
is attracted by a boom: I bought in a rising market, and I shall
have to selJ in a falling cm; having sean a isge paper profit, I
shall end up with a real loss.
The thesis that attracted me to Japan is no longer valid because
t
it was based on excessive liquidity that created a land boom as
well as a boom in the stock market. Railroad shares, which had
been static since the last boom in 1973, were selling at a fraction
of their asset value. Railroad companies have a way of accumulat-
ing assets without showing earnings: since the rate of return on
commercial real estate is traditionally lower than the interest rate,
they can shelter their earnings by borrowing money and investing
it in additional real estate. Thus they enjoy physical growth as
well as the appreciation of their land values. The fly in the oint-
ment is that shareholders do not get any of the benefits: railroad
companies are regulated, and if they want any rate increases they
cannot increase their dividends. But changes are in the wind. The
National Railroad is being converted to private ownership, and it
needs to show better earnings in order to be salable to the public.
Moreover, the pace sf propefiy development needs to be stepped
up if domestic demand is to be stimulated. This means that rail-
road companies need external financing. As a consequence, both
the companies and their underwriters have an interest in seeing
their share prices rise, and most railroad companies have, in fact,
been issuing bonds with warrants at rising prices. Foreign inves-
tors were the first to recognize this reflexive thesis, but to validate
it domestic investors had to follow. That was also beginning to
happen: at the beginning of the new fiscal year (October I), the
newly formed unit trusts (the ones that were guaranteeing a 9%
return to investors) pushed real estate-related shares to an all-time
high on record volume. As it turned out, that was the buying
climax. The break in New York brought redemptions to Fidelity

International Investment Trust, which was heavily invested in
Japanese real estate-related stocks, and they were forced to sell in
Japan. I was aware of that development at the time, and I intended
to lighten up on the next rally; but the rally never came, and the
decline turned into a rout. What I did not realize was the change
in Japanese government policy in fostering capital exports. I
should have taken my cue from the fact that the yen was stabiliz-
ing, but I was complacknt. For that, there is no excuse. Now, the
reflexive thesis has begun to work in reverse. The same factors
that have punctured the stock market are likely to slow down the
real estate boom. Although there is going to be a great increase
in construction, the big increase in land prices is probably be-
hind us. That is why I have to get out of my positions as best I
can.
I must take great care not to compound my error by reacting
emotionally. The hedges I put on prior to my departure did not
protect me against the debacle in Japan; in fact they have cost me
money. I can absorb my Japanese losses; but if I compound them
with other losses, I could get badly hurt. Yet I cannot stand still,
either. I must adjust to the changing circumstances. What are
they?
First, the yen seems to have topped out, and it would not sur-
prise me if it declined, say, 10%. Capital outflows far exceed the
surplus on current account, and it is only because a large portion
of the capital transactions have been hedged that the supply and
demand for the yen have remained in balance for the last two
months. As market participants gain confidence that the peak in
the yen has passed, they may be more willing to hold dollars,
bringing about a reversal of the tread. The government is unlikely
to allow a decline in the yen to go too far, however, for fear of the
political consequences.
I sold all my yen yesterday, and I intend to go short an amount
equal to about half of my long position in DM. If the DM does not
weaken in sympathy with the yen, I may even increase my long
position in DM-half against dollars, half against yen. At the
same time, I am cutting my long position in gold by half until I
can see more clearly.
I have also sold some 20% of my Japanese bonds just to give me
some flexibility, but I think it would be a mistake to liquidate my
position at the current depressed prices. Yields have risen some
50-70 basis points. Contrary to previous occasions, the govern-

==================================================

270 The Real-Time Experiment
ment is likely to resist a further backing up in interest rates, es-
I pecially if the stock market continues to decline and the yen
weakens.
By the same token, my short position in U.S. government bonds
makes less sense than it did a few weeks ago: Japanese investors
are likely to show up in force at the next auction. With the effect
of the OPEC agreement fully felt by then, I intend to cover my
short position on that occasion and perhaps even go long.
My U.S. stock portfolio seems reasonably well hedged at pres-
ent, and I am happy to keep it that way. I am inclined to the short
side, but I restrain myself lest I compound my mistakes. I have
less hositaticn in taking profits on Bang Kong real estate shares,
which are currently at a peak largely as a result of Japanese buy-
ing.
I
I shall also be happy to sell my oil contracts by the second half
of November, when they mature. Indeed, I am setting up for sell-
ing short at higher prices by going long in January and short in
March at practically the same price. I expect the forward discount
to widen as the price goes up.
I am now convinced that the "bull market of a lifetime" is
behind us. There may be occasional flare-ups of speculative activ-
ity, more unsound than ever, but its main thrust is exhausted. The
blind confidence, which is an essential ingredient in a mature
bull market, cannot be reestablished in a hurry. The demise has
been less spectacular than one could have expected from the "bull
market of a lifetime," although there have been classic climaxes
in Italy, France, and now Japan. The closest we came to a climax
in the U.S. has been the momentary rush to redeem mutual funds
in Septexber. 1 feel prettg fooiish for failing to recognize these
signs. The fact is that the bull market was cut short by the mone-
tary authorities before it reached its full extension. They may
lower interest rates yet, but the effect will no longer be the same.
The bull market was based on the flight from physical to monetary
assets; further monetary stimulation is likely to engender a flight
to liquidity, including gold.
At present, there is a temporary lull: OPEC has been patched
up, but without a sound foundation; exchange rates have been
stabilized, but without proper international cooperation; the U.S.
economy is enjoying a temporary respite before the tax reform
comes into effect; and the stock market is buoyed by deals that
must be consummated before the end of the year for the same
reason. What will next year bring?

I managed to sell $750 million worth of yen short before it broke.
When the DM failed to ,resist the rise in the dollar, I reduced my
DM position to $750 million. I am now fully hedged, long in DM
and short in yen. I did not make any money on the maneuver, but
I avoided giving back nfy profits.

272 The Real-Time Experiment
I also tried to unload half my Japanese stock positions on the
t
first rally, but I failed: the Japanese broker reneged on his com-
mitment and took only half the amount he committed for, equal
to one-eighth of my total exposure. The worst of it is that he now
knows my intention. This is going to be a bloody business.
I am beginning to feel uncomfortable with my short positions
in U.S. government bonds and S&Pf utures. With the rally in the
dollar, the case against higher interest rates is weakening, and, if
bonds rally, the shorts in S&P futures may be run in. Everybody
now expects the Japanese to buy the October government bond
refunding; therefore, I must act before. There is a 7-year bond
auction on Tuesday; I must move on that occasion. I can start to
sell or reduce my long positions on the rally that I expect to follow
a successful auction.
I
At present, the stock market is dominated by program trading
and portfolio insurance schemes. These schemes are fundamen-
tally unsound. They virtually assure a loss in exchange for peace
of mind in a declining market. Only if the decline continued, or
if the investor had the strength of character to take off the hedge
in a weak market-which is unlikely, otherwise he would not
have bought portfolio insurance in the first place-could he real-
ize a profit. The very expression'"portfo1io insurance" is a false
metaphor because it is based on an analogy with life insurance;
but death is certain, while a crash is not.
A rally in the stock market would show up the flaw in portfolio
insurance; afterward, the market would be in a better position to
decline. I expect such a decline to follow the next reduction in
short-term interest rates. In the meantime, the stock market could
retest its recent high. Other things being equal, there ought to be
a strong year-end rally because of all the tax-induced selling that
will have preceded it. Of course, the November elections will also
affect the market, but I do not know how.
SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 1,1986
It was a hectic, difficult week. It started out with a collapse in oil
prices due to the Saudi decision to engage in new "net-back"
deals. I managed to liquidate most of my crude oil before the
break, but the drop in oil prices made it more expensive to exe-
cute the rest of my plan. Nevertheless, by Tuesdayafternoon I had
covered half my stock index short and swung around from being

$500 million short in government bonds to an $800 million long
position. But the 7-year auction did not go well-I must have
been the biggest buyer-and by Tuesday night I was losing on all
fronts. Then came two unexpected developments: the dismissal
of Sheik Yamani as Saudi oil minister and the indication that the
Japanese discount rate will be lowered. Suddenly, my position

2 74 The Real-Time Experiment
looked much brighter. I used the opportunity to reduce my hold-
t
ings in Japanese real estate-related stocks and increased my hold-
ings in U.S. government bonds to $1200 million. I also increased
my cross position-long DM, short yen-to $1 billion. I have
bought an additional $250 million worth of DM, giving me a mod-
est net short position in the dollar.
My additional purchase of U.S. bonds turned out to be badly
timed because oil rallied sharply, following a call by the new
Saudi oil minister for an emergency meeting of the OPEC pricing
committee. The situation is extremely confused, but the prevail-
ing opinion is that the change represents a victory for Iran, and
the Saudis will raise prices even if it means selling less oil. I take
a different view, but I have not yet developed a high degree of
t conviction in it. In my opinion, the Saudis will publicly posture
for fixing the oil price at $18, but they will not abandon their net-
back deals and they will continue to play hardball in fighting for
market share. Since it is impossible to maintain oil at $18 without
reducing production all around, it is probable that negotiations
will break down, and there will be another round in the price
war. The Saudis have to be careful, however, not to anger Iran. I
have started to short oil again, but only in small quantities be-
cause I cannot afford to take much risk. I am already exposed
enough in bonds. If my bond play works out, I may become more
courageous in oil-if it is not too late.
In the last two days of the week, a number of stronger economic
figures were released, weakening my strategic position. The dollar
rallied, but the yen/DM cross position has been working in my
favor (see chart on p. 275), especially on Friday, after the joint
Japanese-American statement was released. The statement con-
firms the thesis on which the cross position is based: whatever
pressure develops against the dollar, it will be concentrated on
European currencies-and possibly gold. If, however, the U.S.
economy turns out to be stronger than I expected, the DM may
decline even more than the yen because it has greater volatility.
Thus, the position is not without risk; but I cannot see the dollar
getting much stronger. My main risk is in bonds and in what has
turned into a cross position: long bonds, short stock indexes. I am
not unduly worried about the economic statistics because they
merely confirm a temporary pickup prior to the tax changes; I am
willing to take a view on oil; my main worry is the election next
Tuesday, whose impact I cannot evaluate. The trouble is that my

tolerance for losses has been reduced by the losses I have already
sustained, both in my niacro manipulations-the hedge I took on
prior to my trip to China turned out to be quite costly-and in my
investment portfolio, which continues to unravel. As a conse-
quence, I feel nervous and somewhat overexposed.

The gamble on the governlrrent bond auction did not work out: an
initial profit turned into a loss. I cut my position to limit the loss.
The news on oil has been contradictory and I decided to with-
draw to the sidelines; I also withdrew from gold at the same time.
All I have now is a cross position-long bonds, short stock in-
dexes-which I regard as a temporary expedient; a long position
in Japanese bonds, which I may gradually Iiquidate or partially
switch to German bonds; and my currency positions, which seem
soundly based.
Most of my recent macro moves turned sour; only the decision
to short the yen has saved the day. I can apply the profit on the
yen either to offset the losses on the other moves or to protect my
profits on the DM, but not both. Either way, my macro manipula-

This is an opportune moment to end the real-time experiment
because it is gradually deteriorating into a record of my day-to-

torturous course of my mega-manipulations for a while-if for no
other reason than to give them a more balanced picture than Phase

and return to the original question, namely, the resolution of the

THE CONCLUSION: NOVEMBER 1986
\
The "bull market of a lifetime" came to a premature end. I am not
ruling out the possibility of another bull market, but that would
be a distinct development. *
The very fact that the "bull market of a lifetime" was aborted
provides a valuable insight into the overall situation. It is not the
only sequence that has come to a premature end before it could
have wreaked havoc. The Imperial Circle was another. Once we
start looking for them, other examples abound. OPEC nearly came
apart, but when the chasm opened the members pulled back from
the brink. The same is true of international lending: I have ana-
lyzed collective lending as a system born of emergency which
needs emergency conditions to survive and is so constructed as
to generate the emergency conditions that are needed to keep it in
existence. In the case of freely fluctuating exchange rates, I have
argued that they are cumulatively unstable, but the Group of Five
intervened before their destabilizing effect would have become
intolerable, and we have turned to a system of "dirty float."
Looked at in this light, the U.S. budget deficit becomes another
case in point. I had thought that 1985 would see the culmination
of deficit financing and, with or without Gramm-Rudman, we
would begin to see a gradual improvement. I must now revise this
view. We did, in fact, reach a climax in 1985, but the turning
point did not constitute a departure in the opposite direction.
When the crisis receded, so did our resolution to deal with it. The
* P.S., January 1987: I spoke too soon. But if markets become euphoric, the
"brink" model I shall outline in this chapter becomes all the more relevant.

budget deficit remains almost undiminished and it may easily
swell to a crisis point again.
We may generalize from these instances and formulate the hy-
pothesis that we live in a financial system that tends to go to the
brink and then recoil.' This hypothesis fits in well with the ten-
dency of our economj to flirt with recession and then to rebound
without gathering real strength. There is a logical connection be-
tween the two tendebcies: it is the danger of a recession that
prompts remedial action. Although we can expect the system to
recoil from the brink every time it gets there, we cannot be sure;
and the more confident we become, the greater is the danger that
it will ~ o tl.ir e could, ca!! this a system of self-defeating proph-
ecies,
The system I am describing bears a certain similarity to the
adjustment process in classical economic theory: after all, self-
defeating prophecies are a kind of self-correcting mechanism. But
there are some vital differences. First, the classical adjustment
process tends toward equilibrium; in the system under consider-
ation there is no such tendency. Second, the arrangement de-
scribed here subordinates the real economy to the vagaries of the
financial system. There is a flight from fixed assets to financial
ones. The fortunes of particular industries rise and fall with ex-
change rates but, on balance, it is not unfair to say that the real
economy is being sacrificed to keep the financial economy going.
This fundamental instability creates tensions thatpay find polit-
ical expression. The main dangers are protectionism at home and
debt repudiation in the debtor countries. That is what makes the
system so precarious.
It has not always been so. The first time we went tu the brisk
was in 1982, although the situation had been getting progressively
more unstable ever since the breakdown of fixed exchange rates
in 1973-and that breakdown itself was a sign of instability.
There seems to be a qualitative difference between conditions
prior to 1982 and those afterward. Prior to 1982 the situation may
have been deteriorating but the system was essentially viable; that
is why it was allowed to disintegrate. Since 1982, the system has
been basically unsound, and it has been kept together only by the
threat of a breakdown. Could it be reconstituted on a sounder
basis? I shall consider that question in Chapter 18. Here I must
reconcile the system I am describing with the concept of a credit
and regulatory cycle.
The fact that the normal, cyclical pattern has been broken was

==================================================

290 The Real-Time Experiment
' clear to me from the outset; I emphasized that we were passing
through uncharted territory. But I failed to understand the impli-
cations of this fact; I tried to navigate through uncharted territory
using the same old cyclical chart. No wonder I kept going astray!
First I was surprised by the emergence of the Imperial Circle; then
in the course of the experiment I was surprised by the premature
demise of the Golden Age of Capitalism. In Phase 2 of the experi-
ment I was finally forced to realize that the boornhust pattern is
inappropriate to the current situation. We need a different model.
The image that comes to mind is that of a needle stuck in a groove.
But we need to be somewhat more analytical about it.
The normal. course of the cr~dicty cle has been arrested by the
intervention of the authorities. Thus we must look at their behav-
+ ior for a clue. When disaster threatens, they pull together; when
the danger recedes, they pull apart. This is the mechanism that
lies at the heart of the "going-to-the-brink" phenomenon. The
collective system of lending provides the paradigm, but the other
instances I have cited-the exchange rate system, the budget def-
icit, OPEC, even a 1929-style bull market-also fit the pattern.
The mechanism comes into play only when a bust w~uldha ve
catastrophic consequences; that is why it has been operating only
since 1982. Sometimes it is effective before the climax is reached,
as in the exchange rate system and the "bull market of a lifetime";
sometimes only afterward, as in the international debt crisis and
in OPEC.
Why does the intervention of the authorities fail to produce a
lasting reversal of the trend? Two factors are at play. First, past
excesses are not liquidated but merely contained; therefore they
continue to fester. This is particularly true of the accumulation of
bad debt. Second, an orderly correction or containment may not
be sufficient to bring about a decisive reversal in the prevailing
bias. For instance, the banks continued on their expansionary
path after 1982; the spirit of a bull market could be easily rekin-
dled, especially in the U.S., where the damage to confidence has
not been severe; and in the case of OPEC it remains to be seen
whether the experience of 1986 was sufficient to generate the
cohesion necessary to prevent a recurrence.
The impact of these two factors varies from case to case. As a
consequence, we do not get a clear-cut cyclical pattern but some-
thing much more indecisive and variegated: some trends are gen-
uinely reversed; others go into temporary remission; yet others

f i eC onclusion: November 1986 291
manifest themselves in different forms. For instance, when bank
regulation was tightened in 1984, many of the risks were trans-
ferred to the financial markets.
How is it all going lo end? In theory, we could keep going to
the brink indefinitely, ,but since nothing lasts for ever, somehow
we are going to get odt of the groove. It could happen in one of
two ways: the system could break down as the result of an acci-
dent, or we could gradually work our way out of all the excesses
and stop going to the brink. As we bump along from crisis to
crisis, many of the excesses do get corrected. The banks are less
exposed then they were in 1982; many structural changes have
occurred in the deStor countries; both the hudgct and tho trade
deficits of the United States seem to have culminated; and a 1929-
style boom seems to have come to a premature end. On the other
hand, financial assets continue to accumulate at a pace which
outstrips the creation of "real" wealth, and this disparity is one
of the excesses that needs to be corrected.
A positive resolution would require greater stability in ex-
change rates, a continued decline in real interest rates, and an
appreciation in stock prices to a point where investment in "real"
assets would offer greater returns than would the purchase of
securities. It is difficult to see how such a point could be reached
as long as the federal government continues to borrow at the pres-
ent rate. A negative resolution would involve increasing financial
instability, protectionism, a worldwide recessioa, and a flight
from financial to liquid assets. I cannot predict which outcome is
more likely.
It can be seen that the model I arrived at has even less predictive
power than the b o o ~ u smt odel. The boomlbust model did tit
least indicate the direction and sequence of events; the "brink"
model does not even do that, because a climax is not necessarily
followed by a trend reversal. Nevertheless, the model is not with-
out some explanatory power.
The question posed at the beginning of the experiment-what
is the eventual outcome-must remain unanswered. In that re-
spect, Phase 2 of the experiment ends with a whimper rather than
a bang. But there is another, related, question that admits a more
definite answer: which brink are we going to next? A correct an-
swer can help convert speculation from a random walk to a prof-
itable exercise.
Clearly, the next brink is protectionism. With a Democratic

Congress, some action is inevitable. Its severity will be greatly
I
influenced by the pace of economic activity. If the experience of
the last five years is any guide, protectionist pressures will be
accommodated short of allowing the system to disintegrate. The
administration has already indicated that it is willing to cooperate
with Congress to that end. Nineteen eighty-seven may well see
some measure of protectionism combined with some measure of
debt relief.
The ultimate challenge to the system is a worldwide recession,
and the first half of 1987 will be a severe test in that regard. Some
of the economic activity in the final quarter of 1986 will have
been borrowed from 1387 because of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
Undoubtedly, tax reform will help to eliminate distortions from
I the economy; but it is always when past excesses are corrected
that their negative effect is most severely felt. The much-awaited
retrenchment in consumer spending may finally be upon us.
Moreover, the Japanese economy is weak, and Germany's is weak-
ening. A worldwide recession coupled with protectionist legisla-
tion could sweep us over the brink.
What are the chances of a recession? I find the argument that a
recession must be close at hand just because four years have
elapsed since the last one quite unconvincing. In an expansionary
phase, recessions are induced by the monetary authorities in their
attempt to cool off an overheated economy. But we are not in an
expansionary phase, and there is no overheating. A more convinc-
ing case can be made by arguing that we are in a phase of credit
contraction in which the economy would naturally slip into a
recession unless it is actively stimulated. It is difficult to see
where the stimulation could come from. Still, the monetary au-
thorities have at least one more round of interest rate reductions
in their armory; the decline in the dollar may finally begin to
make its effect felt on the trade balance; and the prospect of higher
oil prices may encourage inventory accumulation. Instead of a
recession, we may just have a few more years of substandard
growth ahead of us.
My analysis is inconclusive, to say the least. What will happen
in the financial markets in 1987? That will be the subject of an
ongoing real-time experiment.

The Conclusion: November 1986 293
P.S., DECEMBER 29, 1986
Two major events have occurred since the conclusion of the ex-
periment: the Boesky affair, and the OPEC agreement. Both have
bullish implications. The Boesky affair constitutes a dramatic
turning point in the speculative excesses of mergermania. In con-
trast to other turning pqints, it does not endanger the system; that
is why it will be allowed to be played out in full. It will not bring
corporate restructuring to a halt, but it will slow it down. The
flow of funds into junk bonds will be reversed, greatly increasing
the risk premiums they must carry. The effect will be to ease the
demand for credit and to nudge the Federa4 Reserere toward easing
the money supply. All these influences are positive for govern-
ment bonds and, indirectly, for blue chips. It is noteworthy that
the bond markets have shrugged off the news of an OPEC agree-
ment. Higher oil prices are likely to encourage inventory accu-
mulation, moderating downward pressures on the economy,
especially in the first quarter of 1987.
I approach the year's end fairly fully invested in both bonds
and stocks and do not intend to take my leave until after a dis-
count-rate cut. The major cloud on the horizon is a renewed
weakness of the dollar.
P.P.S., FEBRUARY 1987
-x$-
Obviously, I spoke too soon when I said that the "bull market of
our lifetime" came to a premature end. The stock market broke
out of its doldrums immediately after the turn of the year and
attained new high ground very soon thereafter. tAJE,aTt considered
to be the end of the bull market turned out to be merely a tempo-
rary interruption that was due to selling pressures engendered by
the abolition of the preferential tax treatment of long-term capital
gains. As soon as the pressure lifted, the market took off.
The current advance qualifies as the third wave in the bull
market that began in August 1982. It has many of the same fea-
tures as the second wave that began in October 1985 but in some
respects it is faster and wilder, as befits a more advanced stage.
For instance, the first buying climax came sooner than last time
and caused sharper price fluctuations (6% in the S&P futures,
versus only 4.8% in 1986). The parallel with the bull market that
led up to the crash of 1929 is widely recognized. The charts of the

,
Dow Jones averages, when superimposed upon each other, show
an uncanny similarity (see chart). Robert Prechter, a technician
who bases his predictions on the Elliott wave theory, has become
the prophet of our time whose predictions can move the market
-indeed, he is largely responsible for the deviation from the
pattern of 1928 that occurred on January 23,1987.
Equally significant is the fact that the Japanese stock market has
also recovered from the nasty break it suffered in October 1986
and reached new highs recently. How do these developments af-
fect the validity and relevance of my conclusions?
The revival of the bull market fits in well with the "brink"
model I developed at the end of the experiment. It is a distin-
guishing feature of the model that we may keep going to the same
I brink instead of experiencing a decisive trend reversal.
The ease with which the model can accommodate the revival
of the bull market confirms my assertion that it has next to no
predictive value. It merely offers a conceptual framework for un-
derstanding the course of events. The specific predictions must

be formulated by the user; the model provides only a general hy-
pothesis about prevailing market expectations-namely, that they
are likely to prove self-defeating.
The user's own prediction may turn out to be false; if so, it is
up to him to correct it. When he is a participant in financial
markets, he has a stronb financial incentive to do so. In the case
of financial advisers, academics, or politicians, it may be more
advantageous to obfuschte one's mistakes than to admit them. The
model can also be useful in that regard. Indeed, it could legiti-
mately be asked whether I have tried to cover up my inability to
predict the course of events by creating the "brink" model. If so,
I shall pay a heavy price, because I intend to use the model in
dealing with the renewed bull market. That is to say, I operate on
the assumption that we are in a 1929-type bull market which will,
however, abort long before it reaches the lofty heights of 1929.
Clearly, there is a loag way to go before the internal dynamics
-or, more accurately, dialectics-of the market render it ripe for
a reversal. If anything, the correction in the second half of 1986,
coupled with the further decline of the dollar, has extended the
"natural" life span of the boom. If it is to be aborted again, the
causes will have to be external. What these external constraints
are has been amply discussed: a recession, coupled with protec-
tionism, would be more dangerous than a buoyant economy.
Eventually, the monetary authorities are unlikely to tolerate a
runaway boom-but that point is a long way swab-at least as far
as the U.S. stock market is concerned.
Not so in Japan. The valuation of Japanese stocks has long
ceased to bear any relevance to the fundamentals. Pricelearnings
mu:tiples are excessive even h relation to the low and declining
interest rates that prevail in Japan. Moreover, the reported earn-
ings of many companies are artificially inflated by profits from
stock transactions. The outlook for industrial profits is poor, and
companies use their surplus cash to speculate in the stock market.
Specialized funds have been set up to attract corporate investors,
and they have been illegally promising a guaranteed minimum
return. A governmental investigation of these so-called "tokkin
funds" received a lot of publicity at the time of the stock market
break of October 1986. Nevertheless, the market has recovered its
poise and reached new highs early in 1987. How far can the boom
go? Just as Italy was the market to watch for impending trouble in
1986, in 1987 it is Japan.

296 The Real-Time Experiment
' The Japanese stock market is fueled by liquidity and the liquid-
ity is generated by the combination of a weak economy and a
strong yen. When either Japanese or non-Japanese holders of dol-
lars convert them into yen, some of those yen find their way into
the stock market. The tendency is particularly strong when the
yen are supplied by the central bank in an endeavor to keep the
exchange rate from rising. When the central bank is not involved,
there is at least a chance that the sellers of yen sell, or fail to buy,
Japanese stocks in order to acquire assets denominated in dollars.
The Japanese government has engaged in a campaign to encour-
age investment abroad and, on the whole, it has been very suc-
cessh!: capitc;! outflows consistently exceed the trade surplus.
The yen continues to strengthen only because of an inflow of
foreign capital and hedging by Japanese investors. Once market
1
participants gain conviction that the trend is changing, they re-
duce their hedging, and the yen falls of its own accord. That is
what happened last October, although the break in the stock mar-
ket preceded the decline of the yen. It is likely to happen again.
Since the end of the year, the upward pressure on the yen has
built up again and the stock market boom gained a new lease on
life. When the pressure abates, involuntary selling by the Bank of
Japan will be replaced by voluntary selling by holders of yen.
That is when the pool .of liquidity will spring a leak. Given the
inflated level of stocks prices, a decline could easily turn into a
rout.
There is a noteworthy similarity between the position of Japan
today and that of the United States in the 1920s: it is emerging as
the leading economic power and its stock market is less seasoned
than that of the mature economies. But that is where the simflarity
ends. The Japanese authorities have a tradition of intervention
and a firm grip on the participants in financial markets. Once
before, in 1965, when the stock market collapsed, the government
set up a corporation to buy, and hold, shares dumped on the
market by distressed holders. Nineteen twenty-nine is not likely
to repeat itself, even in Japan.
The initial impact of a decline in the Japanese stock market
could well be positive for other markets because it is likely to be
associated with a wholesale movement of funds from the Japanese
to other stock markets. But if the decline turns into a rout, it is
bound to send a shiver through the world.

THE SCOPE FOR FINANCIAL ALCHEMY:
AN EVALUATION OF THE EXPERIMENT *
The real-time experiment has turned out quite differently from
what I had expected; moveover, the results of the second phase
are quite different from those of the first: the evaluation I wrote in
June 1986 had to be rewritten in light of what has happened since.
Phase 1 shows my approach at work when it is successful, Phase
2 when it is not. This makes the task of evaluation more complex;
but it will also render the judgment more complete.
In evaluating my approach we must distinguish between its
ability to produce profits in financial markets and its ability to
predict the future course of events. The fact that theYIistinction is
necessary has far-reaching implications, which will be explored
in the course of this chapter and the next one.
First, as to the financial results. Phase 1 coincided with the
most prosperous period of my Fund. In the eleven months be-
tween the inception of the experiment and the end of the control
period, Quantum Fund shares appreciated by 126°/0, as against
27% for the S&P index, 30% for Treasury bond futures, 23% for
the DM, and 34% for the yen. Admittedly, these were prosperous
times for most investors, even for those who were on the wrong
side of the currency trend; but few did as well as my Fund. Lever-
age is only part of the explanation, because leverage works in both
directions: one has to be on the right side of the market to benefit
from it.
Even if we make allowances for an element of coincidence,

300 Evaluation
there can be no doubt that the process of formulating and testing
I hypotheses made a positive contribution to the results.
By contrast, Phase 2 shows a loss. Between July 21, 1986, and
the end of the year Quantum Fund shares declined by 2% as
against a 2% rise for the S&P index, a 2% fall for the Treasury
bond futures, a 1%r ise for the Japanese government bond futures,
and a 5% rise for the Japanese stock index. The DM rose by lo0$,,
the yen fell by 2%, gold rose by 14%, and oil rose by 40%. Putting
both phases into the context of my entire performance, the results
can be considered satisfactory.
The record shows that my trading was far from flawless even in
Phase 1. I was tc~ol sts in buying bonds and too early in selling
them-although I had the courage to reestablish the position at a
much higher price. I was also rather late in recognizing the "bull
4
market of our lifetime" in stocks. My trading in currencies was
the best: the insight that the level of risk had been reduced by the
Plaza meeting of the Group of Five was highly rewarding.
Phase 2 is dominated by one major mistake: my reluctance to
recognize that the "bull market of a lifetime" had run its course
before it had truly earned its name. The consequences were par-
ticularly painful in Japan where I was participating in a classic
boondbust sequence and failed to get out in time. Once commit-
ted, the mistake was difficult to rectify; but at least the analytical
framework made me aware of what I was up against. A method
that produces outstanding results during good periods and
helps to contain losses during bad ones must be declared a suc-
cess.

The Scope for Financial AIchemy 301
My financial success stands in stark contrast with my ability to
forecast events. In this context, we must distinguish between
events in financial markets and events in the real world. Events
in financial markets determine financial success; events in the
real world are relevant, only in evaluating the scientific merit of
my approach. I
Even in predicting vancia1 markets my record is less than
impressive: the best that can be said for it is that my theoretical
framework enables me to understand the significance of events as
they unfold-although the record is less than spotless. One
would expect a successful method to yield firm predictions; but
all my forecasts are extremely tentative a;nd subject to constant
revision in the light of market developments. Occasionally I de-
velop some conviction and, when I do, the payoff can be substan-
tial; but even then, there is an ever-present danger that the course
of events fails to correspond to my expectations. The concept of
the "bull market of a liftime" is a case in point: it was highly
rewarding in Phase 1 but it became more of a hindrance than a
help in Phase 2. My aiproach works not by making valid predic-
tions but by allowing me to correct false ones.
With regard to events in the real world, my record is downright
dismal. The outstanding feature of my predictions is that I keep
on expecting developments that do not materialize. During the
real-time experiment I often envisioned a recession that was just
around the corner, but it never occurred; at the imption of the
experiment I was contemplating a reversal of the Imperial Circle
that was avoided only by the deus ex machina of the Plaza agree-
ment of the Group of Five. Going further back, a collapse of the
banking system has never been far from my thoughts since 1982.
Similarly, I expected the collapse in oil prices to be followed by
a tax on imported oil, of which there is no sign. To be fair, there
were some developments that I anticipated correctly-the col-
lapse in oil prices was one and the willingness of the Japanese to
finance our budget deficit was another. Although I did not antici-
pate the Group of Five meeting at the Plaza Hotel, it fitted my
framework perfectly and I responded to it correctly.
How can financial success and predictive failure be reconciled?
That is the question I shall address in this chapter. But before I
do so, I must remind the reader why it arises in the first place. If
this were a scientific experiment, my financial success would
serve as evidence of the validity of the hypotheses on which my
decisions were based. But the experiment does not qualify as a

scientific one. I need to raise only two considerations to make
4 this point: one personal and the other pertaining to the subject
matter.
My decision-making process was greatly influenced by personal
factors such as my presence or absence from the office, and the
real-time experiment itself was an important personal factor. The
fact that the monetary results served as a possible criterion of the
validity of my ideas made me try harder than I would have oth-
erwise. This is borne out by the fact that my understanding was
much hazier and my moves in the market more tentative during
the control period than they were at the height of the experiment.
Such haziness is quite common; it is the sharp focus that I man-
aged to attain in the course of the experiment that is rather excep-
tional. I was greatly helped by the discipline of having to write
t
down my thoughts. My arguments may not strike the reader as
particularly well organized, but they are certainly more consistent
than they would have been if I had not taken the trouble to for-
mulate them in writing. I was also inspired by the fact that I was
able to combine the two great abiding interests in my life: philo-
sophical speculation and speculation in financial markets. Both
seemed to benefit from the combination: together, they engaged
me more than either one on its own.
The other consideration has to do with external events. Phase 1
happened to coincide with a moment in history when the author-
ities tried to assert their leadership: they cooperated first in push-
ing down the dollar and then in pushing down interest rates. The
theoretical framework I was using was particularly well suited
for dealing with these developments. After all, the interplay be-
tween markets and regulators is one of the main themes in the
concept of a regulatory and credit cycle. My theoretical frame-
work might have proven much less helpful at other moments in
history.
For instance, I recall the time, in 1981-82, when the Federal
Reserve sought to control the quantity of money and allowed
market forces to set interest rates. The market for government
bonds, and to a lesser extent for stocks and currencies, became
like a casino, and my approach of formulating hypotheses and
testing them against the market became worse than useless: by the
time I recognized a market trend and formulated a hypothesis to
explain it, the trend had already changed and I had to find a new
hypothesis. The result was that I was always lagging behind the

market and kept on getting whipsawed until I abandoned the
hopeless struggle and delegated the task of gambling in govern-
ment bond futures to someone more qualified. I found a com-
puter-based speculator, Victor Niederhofer, who had developed a
system using the assurn;ption that the market is a casino. He op-
erated successfully until the international debt crisis of 1982
changed the nature of tqe game. He had the rare fortitude to close
the account before he had lost all the money he had made for me
previously. I could argue that an approach which allows me to
recognize when it does not work is a valid approach; still, it is
somehow more convincing to demonstrate it at a juncture when
it does work.
These two considerations go a long way toward explaining my
financial success during the experiment. They also serve to dis-
qualify it as a scientific experiment. First, the fact that an experi-
ment is conducted is not supposed to influence the outcome; in
my case it did. Second, scientific theories are supposed to be
universally valid, while mine seems to operate only intermit-
tently. But the divergence from a sceintific experiment goes much
deeper. I have never claimed scientific status for my theoretical
framework. On the contrary, I have argued that reflexive processes
cannot be predicted by scientific method, and the real-time exper-
iment was a deliberate attempt to explore an alternative method.
To bring the point home, I have described the alternative method
as alchemy. Scientific method seeks to understandittrings as they
are, while alchemy seeks to bring about a desired state of affairs.
To put it another way, the primary objective of science is the truth
-that of alchemy, operational success.
In the sphere of natural phenomena, there is no distinction
between the two objectives. Nature obeys laws that operate inde-
pendently of whether they are understood or not; the only way
man can bend nature to his will is by understanding and applying
these laws. That is why alchemy has failed and natural science
reigns supreme.
But social phenomena are different: they have thinking partici-
pants. Events do not obey laws that operate independently of
what anybody thinks. On the contrary, the participants' thinking
is an integral part of the subject matter. This creates an opening
for alchemy that was absent in the sphere of natural science. Op-
erational success can be achieved without attaining scientific
knowledge. By the same token, scientific method is rendered just

as ineffectual in dealing with social events as alchemy was in
I
altering the character of natural substances. I shall revert to the
predicament of the social sciences in the next chapter; here I want
to explore the scope for alchemy.
The real-time experiment shows that my approach is more suc-
cessful in dealing with financial markets than with the real world.
The reason for it readily suggests itself: financial markets them-
selves function imperfectly as a mechanism for predicting events
in the real world. There is always a divergence between prevailing
expectations and the actual course of events. Financial success
depends on the ability to anticipate prevailing expectations and
not real-world developments. But, as we have seen, my approach
rarely produces firm predictions even about the future course of
+ financial markets; it is only a framework for understanding the
course of events as they unfold. If it has any validity it is because
the theoretical framework corresponds to the way that financial
markets operate. That means that the markets themselves can be
viewed as formulating hypotheses about the future and then sub-
mitting them to the test of the actual course of events. The hy-
potheses that survive the test are reinforced; those that fail are
discarded. The main difference between me and the markets is
that markets seem to engage in a process of trial and error without
the participants fully understanding what is going on, while I do
it consciously. Presumably that is why I can do better than the
market.
If this view is correct, financial markets 'bear a curious resem-
blance to scientific method: both involve the testing of hy-
potheses. But there is a fundamental difference: in science, testing
serves to establish the truth; in financial markets, the criierion is
operational success. In contradistinction with natural science, the
two criteria do not coincide. How could they? Market prices al-
ways express a prevailing bias, whereas natural science works
with an objective criterion. Scientific theories are judged by the
facts; financial decisions are judged by the distorted views of the
participants. Instead of scientific method, financial markets em-
body the method of alchemy.
This interpretation of financial markets as a mechanism for test-
ing hypotheses by alchemy is both novel and challenging. The
fact that it is not generally accepted adds to the challenge. How
can markets be testing something when the participants don't
know what they are doing? The answer is to be found in the

results they achieve. Try to propound an unformulated hypothe-
sis and you get a hit-or-miss result. By contrast, when you
deliberately formulate your hypotheses, you can consistently out-
perform the market ave~ages-provided your specific predictions
are not too far off the qark. Treating the market as a mechanism
for testing hypotheses seems to be an effective hypothesis. It pro-
duces results that are better than a random walk.
This conclusion validates the approach I have taken over a
strictly scientific one. If we abide by the methods of natural sci-
ence, we arrive at the random walk theory. The hypotheses that
are being tested have to'be disregarded because they do not con-
stitute facts and what we are left with is a jumble of haphazard
price fluctuations. On the other hand, if we look at the situation
from the inside, from the vantage point of a participant, we dis-
cover a process of trial and error. It is not easy to make sense of
the process: many people participate with only a vague idea of
what is going on, and I must confess that the sensation of being
on a random walk is not unfamiliar to me. My attempts at formu-
lating conjectures about the future work only intermittently;
oftentimes all I get is white noise. But when I succeed in formu-
lating a worthwhile conjecture the results can be very rewarding,
as Phase 1 of the experiment demonstrates; and even if my per-
ceptions are flawed, as was often the case in Phase 2, I have a
criterion that I can use to identify my mistakes: the behavior of
the market. d
The real-time experiment has shown how greatly my decision-
making process is influenced by the market action. At first sight
this seems to contradict my original contention that markets are
always wrong. But the contradiction is more apparent than real.
Markets provide the criterion by which investment decisions are
judged. Moreover, they play a causal role in shaping the course of
events. The information is more readily available than events in
the real world; hence the market action offers the most convenient
feedback mechanism by which one's expectations can be evalu-
ated. One need not regard the market as always right in order to
use it in that capacity. Indeed, if one believes that the market is
always right there is little to be gained from having a feedback
mechanism because the prospect of outperforming the market be-
comes a matter of pure chance,
As I shall argue in Chapter 17, the contention of classical eco-
nomic theory that the market mechanism assures the optimum

allocation of resources is false; its true merit is that it provides a
t
criterion by which the participants can recognize their own mis-
conceptions. But it is important to realize what kind of criterion
the market provides: far from being always right, it always incor-
porates the prevailing bias. If participants labor under the misap-
prehension that the market is always right, the feedback they get
is misleading. Indeed, the belief in efficient markets renders mar-
kets more unstable by short-circuiting the corrective process that
would occur if particpants recognized that markets are always
biased. The more the theory of efficient markets is believed, the
less efficient the markets become.
How good are financial markets in predicting real-world devel-
opments? Reading the record, it is striking how many calamities
t that I anticipated did not in fact materialize. The financial mar-
kets must have come to reflect the same concerns; otherwise my
false expectations could not have proven so rewarding. This
raises an interesting possibility. Perhaps some of the develop-
ments I predicted were preempted by the very fact that they were
anticipated by the market and the market provoked a reaction that
prevented them from happening. This seems to hold true of the
collapse of the banking system and of the collapse of the dollar,
and also of the "bull market of our lifetime," which was to be
followed by a crash 1929 style. The monetary authorities became
so concerned about the excessive buoyancy of financial markets
that in the end they refused to supply the excess liquidity that
would create a speculative bubble. Their action was neither delib-
erate nor unanimous. In the U.S., Volcker was opposed to provid-
ing excess liquidity but he was defeated in the Open Market
Committee and had to appeal to Germany to join in a round of
interest rate reductions. When Secretary Baker pushed for another
round, the Germans balked and the resulting row almost wrecked
the Group of Five process. The Japanese devised their own medi-
cine but by the time it took effect the speculative bubble was
sufficiently developed to precipitate a more or less full-scale bust
in the Japanese stock market. No wonder that I had difficulty in
recognizing the premature demise of the bull market of a life-
time! * It is possible that the United States will continue to create
excess liquidity, but I consider it unlikely that it will cause a
speculative bubble because confidence has been too badly shaken.

It is more likely that investors would flee to liquidity and gold.
When I finally recognized that markets can preempt the catastro-
phes they predict, I concluded that we live in an age of self-
defeating prophecies.
The collapse of oil pdces does not seem to fit the argument
because it actually occuirred; but that may be attributed to the
fact that either I or the authorities have misjudged its dire con-
sequences. I expected shch severe repercussions on the bank-
ing system and on the economy as to make a levy on imported
oil indispensable, while we seem to have gotten along fine with-
out it. In the end, it was left to OPEC to pull itself together.
The present arrangement is more permanent than the Group
30
of Five process; the drama has yet to be played out in both
cases.
This line of argument opens up a fascinating vista. I may have
discovered not just a reasonably effective way of operating in
financial markets but an actual model of how the financial mar-
kets operate in the real world. Models currently in use are based
on the misconception that markets can only foreshadow events,
they cannot shape them. My approach recognizes that financial
markets can also precipitate or abort future events. Following this
line of argument, it is possible that we have indeed been teetering
on the verge of both a deflationary spiral and a free fall of the
dollar-not to mention all sorts of other financial calamities-
and we have been saved from them only because &the danger
signals emitted by the financial markets. In other words, financial
markets constantly anticipate events, both on the positive and on
the negative side, which fail to materialize exactly because they
have been anticipated. No wonder that fi~anciallm arkets get so
excited in anticipating events that seem quite harmless in retro-
spect! It is an old joke that the stock market has predicted seven
of the last two recessions. We can now understand why that
should be so. By the same token, financial crashes tend to occur
only when they are unexpected.
This last point should not be overstated. There are many events
that actually occur in spite of the fact that they were widely antic-
ipated. The collapse in oil prices is a case in point; the outbreak
of the Second World War was another. It has become fashionable
to be a contrarian, but to bet against prevailing expectations is far
from safe. It will be recalled that, in the boom/bust model, events
tend to reinforce prevailing expectations most of the time and

contradict them only at the inflection points; and inflection points
I are notoriously difficult to identify. Now that the contrarian view-
point has become the prevailing bias, I have become a confirmed
anti-contrarian.

THE QUANDARY OF THE
SOGIAL SCIENCES
We are now in a position to appreciate the predicament of the
social sciences. Scientific method is based on the presumption
that a successful experiment corroborates the validity of the hy-
pothesis that is was designed to test. But in situations with think-
ing participants, experimental success does not assure the truth
or validity of the statements that are being tested. The real-time
experiment is a case in point: inconclusive and occasionally pa-
tently false predictions were crowned by financial success. Ad-
mittedly, the experiment was not a scientific one; I went to great
lengths to emphasize its alchemical character. ButAhe very fact
that alchemy can succeed raises questions about scientific
method; and the fact that scientific theories do not seem to be able
to produce superior results compounds the predicament. I shall
argue that social science is a hlse metaphor and we shall be better
off if we recognize it as such.
Scientific method works whenever scientists have an objective
criterion at their disposal by which the truth or validity of their
statements can be evaluated. The scientists' understanding is
never perfect; but the objective criterion allows misunderstand-
ings to be corrected. Scientific method is an interpersonal process
in which the contribution of each participant is subjected to the
critical appraisal of all others. Only when all the participants are
guided by the same criterion is the critical process capable of
producing results that qualify as knowledge. That is why the
availability of an objective criterion is indispensable to the suc-
cess of scientific method.

The role of an objective criterion is filled by facts. Statements
I that correspond to the facts are true; those that do not are false.
Unfortunately, the facts are not always as dependable as this sim-
ple statement makes them out to be. They can serve as an objec-
tive criterion only when they are totally independent of the
statements that relate to them. That is the case in natural science
where one fact follows another irrespective of what anybody
thinks. But it is not the case in social science where events incor-
porate the participants' bias. It should be emphasized that the
interference comes not only from scientists but also from partici-
pants. Indeed, if the participants' thinking did not play a causal
role in shasir,g ths course of events no observer could influencs
the course of events by making statements about it and the situa-
tion of the social scientist would be no different from that of the
I
natural scientist. It is the participants' thinking that creates the
problems.
The structure of events that have no thinking participants is
simple: one fact follows another in an unending causal chain. The
presence of thinking participants complicates the structure of
events enormously: the participants' thinking affects the course
of events and the course of events affects the participants' think-
ing. To make matters worse, participants influence and affect each
other. If the participants' thinking bore some determinate rela-
tionship to the facts there would be no problem: the scientific
observer could ignore the participants' thinking and focus on the
facts. But the relationship cannot be accurately determined for
the simple reason that the participants' thinking does not relate
to facts; it relates to events in which they participate, and these
events become facts only after the participants' thinking has made
its impact on them. Thus the causal chain does not lead directly
from fact to fact but from fact to perception and from perception
to fact with all kinds of additional connections between partici-
pants that are not reflected fully in the facts.
How does this complex structure affect the ability of an ob-
server to make valid statements about the course of events? His
statements must also be more complex. In particular, they must
allow for a fundamental difference between past and future: past
events are a matter of record, while the future is inherently unpre-
dictable. Explanation becomes an easier task than prediction-as
the real-time experiment illustrates. Generalizations do not apply
to the future with as much force as to the past, and the beautiful

symmetry that characterizes the deductive-nomological (D-N)
model of science is destroyed. This goes against the grain of sci-
entific generalizations, which are supposed to be timelessly valid.
It is possible to establish universally valid generalizations-
witness the ones I proposed about freely fluctuating exchange
rates-but they cannot be used to predict the course of events.
What is worse, the facts ldo not provide an adequate criterion by
which the validity of gelieralization can be judged because there
is more to the subject matter than facts. The fact that a prediction
turns out to be true does not necessarily validate the theory on
which it is based and, conversely, a valid theory does not neces-
sarily generate predictions that can be checked against the facts.
Indeed, the sequence of social events cannot be properly under-
stood if we confine our attention to facts. The participants' think-
ing is an integral part of the situation they participate in; to treat
such a situation as if it were composed exclusively of facts dis-
torts the subject matter. The D-N model of scientific method,
which we reviewed briefly in Chapter 1, is based on a strict seg-
regation of facts and statements. Thus we are forced to the conclu-
sion that the D-N model is not applicable to the study of social
events.
It would be a mistake to equate the D-N model with scientific
method. Even the theory of science recognizes other models, no-
tably statistical or probabilistic ones and laws relating to an ideal
case as in economic theory. Moreover, the practic;~of science
differs significantly from its theory and a study of these differ-
ences has given rise to further refinements in the theory of science
since the D-N model was originally developed. Nevertheless, the
D-N model embodies the ideal that scientific method strives for:
universally valid generalizations that can be used for prediction
and explanation with equal force and are amenable to testing.
Natural science has so many accomplishments to its credit that it
can dispense with theoretical models and pursue its investiga-
tions wherever they may lead; but social science, exactly because
it has been less successful, is in greater need of the prestige that
the D-N format can impart. To abandon the D-N model is to give
up what is most valuable, persuasive, and attractive in science.
But that is only half the story. When the course of events is
influenced by the participants' bias, future events are open to
manipulation by observers in a way that is not possible in natural
science. That is the point I was trying to make by speaking of

alchemy. Since alchemy is unable to influence natural phenom-
I ena, the social sciences face a problem that has no parallel in the
natural sciences. The critical process that is the foundation of
science works smoothly only when the participants share the
same objective. The avowed purpose of science is the pursuit of
truth; but when the subject matter is open to manipulation, par-
ticipants may be more interested in changing the course of events
than in understanding it. The fact that they can enhance their
influence by claiming scientific status for their views undermines
the critical process even further.
How can scientific method protect itself against subversion?
The first step is to recognize the danger. That requires the repu-
diation of the "doctrine of the unity of science." People partici-
pate in science with a variety of motivations. For present
t
purposes we may distinguish between two main objectives: the
pursuit of truth and the pursuit of what we may call "operational
success." In natural science, the two objectives coincide: true
statements work better than false ones. Not so in the social sci-
ences: false ideas may be effective because of their influence on
people's behavior and, conversely, the fact that a theory or predic-
tion works does not provide conclusive evidence of its validity.
Marxism provides an outstanding example of the first kind of
divergence; and my own prediction of the "bull market of a life-
time" of the second.
The divergence between truth and operational or experimental
success undermines scientific method in more ways than one. On
the one hand, it renders scientific theories less effective; on the
other, it allows nonscientific theories to achieve operational suc-
cess. What is worse, an alchemical theory can profit from assum-
ing a scientific guise.
We cannot remove the first two limitations because they are
inherent in the subject matter; but we can protect against the
third. All we have to do is to recognize the limitations of scientific
method when it comes to dealing with social situations. This is
what I propose to do by declaring social science a false metaphor.
That means that the methods of natural science do not apply to
the study of social events. It emphatically does not mean that we
ought to abandon the pursuit of truth in the study of social events.
To try to argue about motivations would be totally counterprod-
uctive. Every contribution must be considered on its merit and
not on the basis of its intentions, otherwise the critical process

which is at the heart of the scientific method would turn to sham-
bles. It is noteworthy that two schools of thought that insisted on
judging contributions by their source rather than on their merit,
namely, Marxism and psychoanalysis, were also the most suc-
cessful in subverting scikntific method.
The only way to protect against subversion is to establish a
special convention for the study of social phenomena. Instead of
demanding that contribdtions be cast in the D-N mold in order to
qualify as scientific, theories of the D-N type would be treated as
a form of social alchemy. The convention would not automati-
cally disqualify every theory, prediction, or explanation that
claims scientific status but it would put the burden of proof on
them to justify their claim. It would prevent the abuse of scientific
method for alchemical purposes and allow theories, like mine,
that do not produce unconditional predictions to qualify as valid
contributions. The convention is necessary because without it the
arguments I am presenting here would have to be repeated in each
and every case, and that would be impractical to say the least. Try
to convince a Marxist that Marxism is not scientific!
I happen to be passionately interested in the pursuit of truth,
but I am also fully cognizant of the need to attain operational
success in order to get a hearing for my views. As I admitted
earlier, that consideration was a major driving force behind the
real-time experiment. My success in the stock market has had the
liberating effect of allowing me to speak my mind> am in the
fortunate position of not needing operational success as a scien-
tist, having been able to attain it as a participant.
But people in the academic professions are not so lucky: they
compete directly with natural scientists for status and funds. Nat-
ural science has been able to produce universally valid generali-
zations and unconditional predictions. In the absence of a
convention to the contrary, social scientists are under great pres-
sure to come up with similar results. That is why they produce so
many scientific-looking formulas. Declaring social science a false
metaphor would liberate them from having to imitate natural sci-
ence.
Apart from academia, there are many fields where participants
can obtain operational success by claiming scientific status for
their views. Financial forecasting is one; politics is another. The
history of ideas is littered with examples. Marxism is the political

sez-faire policies also derive their intellectual force from a scien-
I tific theory-namely, the theory of perfect competition-and
Freud was just as determined to claim scientific status as Marx.
I have no grounds for impugning the motivations of others.
After all, I have just as overwhelming a desire to see my views
accepted as everybody else, and I am marshaling whatever argu-
ments I can to support my views. Moreover, in my previous incar-
nation as a securities analyst I often espoused views that I knew
to be distorted for the sake of their operational effect, so that I am
no holier than anyone else.
The question is not one of motivation but of operational effect.
A csnsideratisn c.f the stnciure of social evzntz she;v:s that all
predictions are contingent on the participants' decisions. Yet the
pursuit of operational success often drives people to try to com-
I
pete with natural science by making more unconditional predic-
tions. This has the operational effect of endangering the pursuit
of truth in the study of social phenomena. As long as the doctrine
of the unity of science prevails, there is a direct conflict between
the pursuit of truth and the pursuit of operational success. It can
be resolved only by renouncing the doctrine.
I have managed to claim exemption from the rigorous require-
ments of the D-N model by renouncing the doctrine of the unity
of science. I went even further: I asserted that the pursuit of truth
prohibits unconditional predictions. Does that mean that the
kinds of conjectures I produced are the best that can be hoped
for? Certainly not. The real-time experiment is best regarded as
an amateur effort that ought to be improved upon when the ap-
propriate professional skills are developed.

FREE MARKETS VERSUS REGULATION
It is almost redundant to criticize the concept of equilibrium any
further. In the first chapter, I asserted that the concept is a hypo-
thetical one whose relevance to the real world is open to question.
In subsequent chapters I examined various financial markets as
well as macro-economic developments and showed that they ex-
hibit no tendency towards equilibrium. Indeed, it makes more
sense to claim that markets tend towards excesses, which sooner
or later become unsustainable, so that they are eventually cor-
rected.
Equilibrium is supposed to ensure the optimum-allocation of
resources. If markets do not tend towards equilibrium, the main
agrument that has been used in favor of the market mechanism
loses its validity: we have no grounds for believing that markets
optimize anything.
This may sound like a startling conclusion, but it falls far short
of that. The concept of an optimum is just as alien to a world in
which participants function without the benefit of perfect knowl-
edge as the concept of an equilibrium, and for the same reason:
both concepts presuppose perfect knowledge. So it is not at all
surprising if both of them are shown to have little relevance to
the real world.
There are other arguments that can be advanced in favor of the
market mechanism. Indeed, an interesting line of argument seems
to emerge from the discussion in Chapter 15. I interpreted finan-
cial markets as a process that is somewhat akin to scientific
method-that is to say, a process of trial and error in which the

market price at the termination of the experiment serves as a
I criterion by which the experiment can be judged. The criterion
does not meet the requirements of scientific method, because the
market price is not independent of the participants' decisions in
the way in which the events studied by natural scientists are
independent of the statements that scientists make about them.
Nevertheless, it is a useful criterion because it is just as real and
just as amenable to scientific observation as any natural phenom-
enon. Moreover, it is of vital interest to market participants. Thus
the market mechanism has the merit of providing an objective
criterion albeit a biased one.
Haw great that merit is we czn appreciate only xhen we con-
sider what happens in its absence. For that purpose, we must look
at centrally planned economies which, in revulsion against the
I
deficiencies of market economies, have eschewed the use of the
pricing mechanism. Output has to be measured in physical quan-
tities, and the distortions are far worse than the excesses of the
market.
Winston Churchill once said that democracy is the worst form
of government except for all the others. The same can be said
about the market mechanism: it is the worst system of allocating
resources except for all the others. Indeed, there are significant
similarities between the election mechanism and the market
mechanism. It would be difficult to argue that elections optimize
the political leadership of a country: the skills needed to attract
votes bear little relevance to the qualities a candidate is going to
need once he is in office. Nevertheless, the very fact that he has to
run for election imposes a discipline which helps prevent some
of the more egregious excesses.
The value of an objective criterion is perhaps best appreciated
subjectively. We all live in a fantasy world. Having an affinity for
abstract ideas, I am perhaps more apt to be carried away into a
world of my own creation than many other people. The markets
have always helped to preserve my sense of reality. It may seem
paradoxical that my sense of reality should be rooted in the mar-
kets when markets often behave so strangely that they strike other
onlookers as unreal; yet as a market participant, I am not merely
aware of being connected to reality: I actually feel it in my guts. I
react to events in the marketplace as an animal reacts to events in
the jungle. For instance, I used to be able to anticipate an impend-
ing disaster because it manifested itself in the form of a backache.

1 was of course unable to tell what shape the disaster would take:
by the time I could identify it, my backache would dissolve. There
was a time when my involvement with the market was all-
embracing-much to the detriment of my relationships with
human beings. Now that I have managed to distance myself, my
market sense has sufferbd. Events often reach me as white noise:
I cannot make sense of8t hem. For instance, during the real-time
experiment, market dejelopments had sharp contours; during the
control period, the outlines became more blurred.
It is interesting to observe how my market involvement relates
to my ability to organize abstract ideas. One would think that
being active in the market would interefere with writing, but the
opposite seems to be the case: the discipline of having to make
investment decisions prevents me from getting too far divorced
from reality. During the three years that 1 was writing the The
Burden of Consciousness, I lost my ability to make money in the
stock market and eventually I got lost in my own abstractions.
Again, during the three years when I was trying to make sense of
the international debt problem I saw my ability to operate in the
market diminish, and, what is worse, I sensed that my analysis of
the debt problem was becoming increasingly removed from real-
ity. By contrast, the real-time experiment brought both my invest-
ment activities and mysability to express myself to a high pitch.
I mention this because it may have more than subjective rele-
vance. Had I been an academic, I could have persbted with my
analysis of the debt problem, and if reality failed to conform to
my expectations, I could have defended my analysis by blaming
extraneous developments. Eventually, some of my expectations
were fulfilled, albeit with a delay of several years. As a market-
oriented man, I found such a delay intolerable, and I felt obliged
to search for, and to recognize, the flaws in my argument. As an
academic, I could have claimed to be vindicated. The point I am
trying to make is that the market is a harder taskmaster than aca-
demic debate.
Yet it is easy to exaggerate the merits of having an objective
criterion at our disposal. We have become so fixated on objective
criteria that we are inclined to endow them with a value they do
not intrinsically possess. Profit-the bottom line-efficiency-
takes on the aspect of an end in itself, instead of being a means to
an end. We tend to measure every activity by the amount of
money it brings. Artists are valued according to the price their

products sell for. What is worse, we often want to make a profit
I from activities that ought to be otherwise motivated. Politicians
want to earn lecture fees and sell their memoirs; White House
aides become lobbyists; generals in charge of procurement angle
for lucrative jobs in industry, and so do lawyers working for reg-
ulatory agencies. The profit motive has become so all-embracing
that we find it hard to accept when someone is motivated by
considerations other than profit. An American executive finds it
a nuisance when an Englishman is unwilling to relocate for the
sake of a better job, a South African black who prefers to destroy
civilization rather than put up with apartheid strikes us as posi-
tively barbaric-not to .mention a phecsmenon like Islamic fun-
damentalism which is totally beyond our ken. Values that
motivate people cannot be readily translated into objective terms;
1
and exactly because individual values are so confusing, we have
elevated profit and material wealth-which can be readily mea-
sured in terms of money-into some kind of supreme value.
Surely that is an exaggeration. The fact is that in a world of im-
perfect understanding, there is some kind of exaggeration or bias
involved in every value. In our civilization, the value of profit is
exaggerated and so is the value of objectivity.
Let us take a closer look at the kind of criterion market prices
provide. The distinction we have drawn between scientific
method and alchemy will come in useful. I have argued that in
the study of social phenomena we need to distinguish between
two kinds of validity: one associated with truth, the other with
effectiveness. In natural science, the distinction is missing: theo-
ries are effective only if they are true; that is why alchemy does
not work. Following this line of thought, we can argue that the
market price provides a criterion of effectiveness but not a crite-
rion of truth. Future market prices will determine how the various
participants fare, but they will not determine whether their un-
derstanding is correct. Only if market prices tended towards an
equilibrium would the two criteria merge: the market price would
then be the "correct" price.
We can see now how important the concept of equilibrium is.
It serves as a bridge between natural and social science and
eliminates the disturbing dichotomy between truth and effective-
ness that characterizes the study of social phenomena. Unfortu-
nately, the bridge does not stand up, because imperfect
understanding renders the concept of equilibrium inappropriate.

Without an innate tendency towards equilibrium, the course of
events cannot be deterknined by scientific method; but it can be
shaped by the methods of alchemy.
The attempt to transpose the methods and criteria of natural
science to the social sphere is unsustainable. It gives rise to in-
flated expectations thai cannot be fulfilled. These expectations go
far beyond the immediate issue of scientific knowledge and color
our entire way of thinking. The belief that economic policy ought
to aim at the optimum allocation of resources has dominated po-
litical thought-and political action-since the middle of the
nineteenth century. Those on the left wanted the State to take
charge of the allocation; those on the right wanted to leave it to
the market mechanism. Under the influence of Marxism, the pur-
suit of the optimum led to the total abandonment of the market
mechanism in large parts of the world. Even in market-oriented
economies, the State was given a large role in correcting the im-
perfections of the market mechanism. Gradually, the harmful side
effects of State intervention have become increasingly evident,
and the prevailing bias has swung back in favor of free markets.
We are quite willing to recognize the fallacy in Marxism, but
we are much less inclined to admit that the theory of perfect
competition is imbued with a similar fallacy. Both are built on
the assumption of perfect knowledge. In one case, the assumption
produces market equilibrium; in the other, it finds expression in
an unconditional prediction of the course of histop. It is worth
pointing out that both theories originated in the nineteenth cen-
tury, when the limitations of knowledge were not yet recognized
and science reigned supreme.
Once we recognize that the optimum is unattainable, we me in
a better position to evaluate the merits and shortcomings of the
market mechanism. I do not want to get involved in the problems
connected with the distribution of wealth-not because I do not
consider them important, but only because my analysis has little
to contribute to the subject; I want to focus on one particular
weakness of the market mechanism: its innate instability. Its
cause has been identified: it derives from the two-way connection
between thinking and reality that I have labeled reflexivity. It is
not in operation in all markets at all times; but if and when it
occurs, there is no limit to how far away both perceptions and
events can move from anything that could be considered equilib-
rium.

' Instability is not necessarily harmful; indeed, if it were de-
scribed as dynamic adjustment, it would sound positively benign.
But carried to extremes, it can give rise to sudden reversals that
may take on catastrophic proportions. That is particularly the
case where credit is involved, because the liquidation of collateral
can lead to sudden compression of market prices. The prevention
of excessive instability is therefore a necessary condition for the
smooth functioning of the market mechanism. It is not a condition
that the market mechanism can ensure on its own. On the con-
trary, I have presented evidence that unregulated financial mar-
kets tend to become progressively more unstable. The evidence is
most clea-cut ir, the currancy markets, but it is also qiiite psrana-
sive with regard to the expansion and contraction of credit.
Whether stock markets would prove inherently unstable if there
t
were no credit involved remains an open question, because stock-
market booms are always associated with credit expansion. Ex-
cessive instability can be prevented only by some sort of regula-
tion.
How much instability is excessive is a matter of judgment. Stan-
dards vary with time. The degree of dislocation we are willing to
tolerate today, as measured by unemployment figures, would
have seemed inconceivable a few decades ago when the memories
of the Great Depression were still fresh and the drawbacks of full-
employment policies less evident. Similarly, the restrictions on
corporate restructuring have been greatly relaxed between the
conglomerate boom of the 1960s and the mergermania of the
1980s.
The trouble with regulation is that the regulators are also
human, and apt to err. In order to avoid arbitrary behavior and
abuse of power, rules and regulations need to be fixed in advance,
and it is difficult to devise regulations that are flexible enough to
meet all contingencies. Regulations tend to be rigid and to hinder
innovation. The rigidities and distortions they introduce tend to
be just as cumulative as the instability of an unregulated market.
Income taxes provide a good example. The steeper the rates and
the longer they stay in effect, the more widespread the tax avoid-
ance and the more complex the tax code.
I do not want to keep the discussion at such a high level of
generality much longer, because it can easily deteriorate into
empty phrases. I shall try to make some policy suggestions in the
next chapter; here I want to make only one general point. Both

regulation and unrestrained competition can be harmful when
carried to extremes, but the failure of one extreme is no justifica-
tion for turning to the other. The two extremes should be treated
not as alternatives, but as limits, within which the right balance
needs to be struck. Tbe task is complicated by our innate ten-
dency to be biased in one direction or the other.
In The Burden of ;Consciousness, written some twenty-five
years ago, I developed a rather elaborate scheme along these lines.
I took the rate of change as my critical variable, and I argued that
people, with their imperfect understanding, are bound to exagger-
ate it in one directiori or the other. One extreme yields a tradi-
tional or a dogmatic inode of thinking according to which the
existing arrangements have to be accepted as they are because it
is inconceivable that they should be otherwise. The other extreme
produces a critical mode of thinking in which everything is con-
sidered possible until disproved. Each mode of thinking is linked
with a form of social organization which corresponds to it with
the degree of imperfection that is appropriate to the imperfect
understanding of the participants. In this way, the traditional
mode of thinking is associated with tribal society, the dogmatic
mode with totalitarian society, and the critical mode with Open
Society. Needless to say, I was very much under the influence of
Karl Popper. I opted for Open Society, but the choice was not
without qualification. Each form of social organization was found
wanting in something that could be found only% its opposite:
totalitarian society lacked freedom; Open Society lacked stability.
But given our innate bias, a stable equilibrium between the two is
just as unlikely to be attained as a stable equilibrium in a free
market. Sentiment is likely to swing in one direction or the other.
After nearly half a century of what now appears as excessive
regulation, we have been moving towards excessive deregulation.
The sooner we recognize that some kind of regulation is necessary
in order to maintain stability, the better our chances of preserving
the benefits of a nearly free market system.

TOWARD AN INTERNATIONAL
CENTRtZL, BANK
We have concluded that financial markets are inherently unsta-
ble. What practical measures are needed to prevent them from
breaking down? I find myself ill-qualified to provide an answer.
My strength lies in identifying the flaws in any system and not in
designing systems. I have long nurtured the fantasy of becoming
an economic reformer a la Keynes but the closer I come to getting
a hearing for my views, the more acutely aware I become of my
own limitations. My particular expertise is derived from the in-
sight that all systems are flawed; but my understanding of any
particular system is always inferior to that of the experts. This
holds true for security analysis as well as finance and economics.
When I sat for an examination as supervisory security analyst, I
failed in every subject; in analyzing the credit-cum-regdatory
cycle, I felt the lack of a thorough grounding in the theory of
money; and, as the reader saw, in the real-time experiment my
greatest weakness was in economic forecasting. Both in my in-
vestment activities and in writing this book I could take the state
of the art in any particular subject as given without actually pos-
sessing it; but when it comes to designing a new financial system,
my lack of knowledge becomes a decided drawback.
Nevertheless, I feel I have a contribution to make, especially as
the prevailing wisdom has so little to offer. Keynesianism (as
distinct from Keynes) has been discredited by the inflation of the
1970s; monetarism is in the process of being shown to be irrele-
vant to a regime of variable exchange rates and large-scale inter-
national capital movements; and supply-side economics turns out

to be not much more than a pun on the Keynesian emphasis of
the demand side. There is a general malaise, but no clear ideas. In
these circumstances even my vague and tentative ideas may prove
useful.
First, I think we sh~uldd istinguish between economic policy
and systemic reform. Both are necessary, but neither is sufficient
by itself. It is difficult ;to imagine how any system could function
fully automatically. Experience shows that every system-be it
the gold standard, Bretton Woods, or freely floating exchange
rates-has broken down when it was not supported by the appro-
priate economic polidies. It is equally difficult to see how eco-
nomic policies could 'correct the prevailing inhalances without
some sort of systemic reform. The various imbalances are inter-
connected and it is impossible to deal with one without affecting
the others.
We are confronted with a disconcerting array of imbalances and
instabilities. To mention but a few: unstable exchange rates, the
international debt problem, the chronic budget and trade deficits
of the United States, the chronic trade surplus of Japan, a chronic
worldwide surplus of agricultural and mineral products, unstable
commodity prices with particular emphasis on oil, unstable inter-
national capital movements, and unstable international financial
markets. Some of these instabilities are caused by economic poli-
cies and can be altered only by pursuing different ones; others are
inherent in the prevailing system and can be cured%nly by chang-
ing the system.
We can take as an example of the first kind of imbalance the
desire of the Japanese to produce more than they consume and
the apparent desire of the United States to consume more than it
produces. If unchecked, these tendencies will lead, in due course,
to the rise of Japan as the dominant economic power of the world
and to the decline of the United States. The transition is bound to
cause a great deal of commotion and dislocation, but its occur-
rence can be prevented only by changing economic and financial
policies and not by changing the financial system. The system
itself must be able to accommodate the transition, insofar as it
occurs; otherwise it will break down to the detriment of all parties
concerned.
An example of the second kind of imbalance is the prevailing
system of exchange rates. As we have seen, freely floating ex-
change rates are cumulatively destabilizing. The fact has now

been recognized by the authorities, and the Plaza agreement has
I
committed them to managing the exchange rates. But there is no
agreement on how to do it. Managing exchange rates is tanta-
mount to coordinating economic policies. If coordination can be
achieved on a voluntary basis, well and good. If not, a different
system will have to be devised.
In this chapter I shall explore the possibilities for systemic re-
form; the appropriate economic policies will be discussed only
tangentially.
In my opinion, there are three major problem areas that require
systemic reform: exchange rates, commodity pricing with special
emphasis on oil, and international debt. Each of these problem
areas has a number of aspects that cannot be dealt with individ-
I ually but only as part of the whole system. There is a fourth major
problem area that is not even recognized as such: international
capital markets. They reflect, accommodate, and help to generate
the various other imbalances. Their rapid development is univer-
sally acclaimed as a welcome innovation and treated as yet an-
other instance where markets spontaneously adjust to changing
needs. I contend that, in retrospect, the rapid growth of interna-
tional capital markets will be recognized as yet another excess,
similar to the rapid growth of international bank lending in the
1970s. We all know that the international lending boom was
based on faulty foundations; I believe it is only a matter of time
before the flaws in international capital markets will be recog-
nized.
At present, there is a strong predilection for treating problems
on a case-by-case basis. It is now generally agreed, for instance,
that exchange rates cannot be allowed to drift any further without
interference; but it is also agreed that the.interference has to be
gradual and tentative. The debate revolves around the question of
target zones: should they be tacit or explicit? The possibility of
returning to fixed exchange rates is more or less ruled out. Simi-
larly, there is a recognition that the international debt problem
requires some new initiative; but the Baker Plan emphatically
insists on a case-by-case approach. It is easy to see why. A conces-
sion granted to one country can easily spread to all others, so that
any talk of systemic reform can precipitate a breakdown of the
system. As far as oil prices are concerned, the matter is left to
OPEC; the idea that consumer countries ought to cooperate to
bring stability to the industry has not even been broached.

The step-by-step approach advocated by James Baker represents
a significant advance oier the hands-off approach taken by Don-
ald Regan when he was at the Treasury. It constitutes a recogni-
tion that markets cannot be left to their own devices, that the
authorities have to proyide some direction if a breakdown is to
be avoided. The initiatibe taken at the Plaza meeting of the Group
of Five touched off a major rise in the world's stock and bond
markets. But the momentum generated by the Plaza meeting has
dissipated and we are once again drifting dangerously, If the
momentum could be recaptured by ad hoc measures, well and
good. But without effective international cooperation the dangers
of protectionism, currency dislocations, and a breakdown in debt
service loom larger than ever, and the need for systemic reform
becomes correspondingly more pressing.
Once we turn to systemic reform, the approach has to be com-
pletely reversed. Instead of dealing with individual problems in
isolation, we must tackle them all at the same time. Problems that
appear intractable on their own may fall into place within a larger
solution. The more cdmprehensive the scheme, the better its
chance of success. Perhaps the three or four major problem areas
I have mentioned could be treated separately, but it would be
more effective to deal with them simultaneously. 1 realize that
any radical change in prevailing arrangements goes against the
grain, especially in matters of international cooperation where the
common good has to be whittled down to accommdate national
interests. But there are times when reforms are both possible and
necessary. Usually, those are times of crisis.
In the following pages I shall discuss the major problem areas
separately, but the solution I shall suggest will link them together.
It involves the creation of an international central bank. Histori-
cally, central banking has evolved in response to crises. Each
central bank has its own history, although developments in one
financial center have also affected the others. The problems of the
present time are primarily international; hence, the solution must
also be international. We have the beginnings of international
central banking institutions: the Bank for International Settlement
was organized in 1930 in response to the German debt problem;
the IMF and the World Bank were founded in 1944 at Bretton
Woods. The next step ought to involve an enlargement of their
functions or the establishment of a new institution.

t Exchange Rates
Exchange rate misalignments have become a major source of dis-
ruption for the world economy. They make it unsafe to make long-
term investments, they endanger the value of investments already
made, and they are at the root of protectionist sentiment in the
United States. The market mechanism fails to bring currencies
back into alignment. On the contrary, speculation tends to exag-
gerate currency moves. As we have seen, the system of freely
floating currencies is cumulatively destabilizing.
The question is: what can be done about it? A number of ar-
rangements are possible. Target zones, either tacit or explicit, con-
stitute the least radical and therefore the most often mentioned
I
alternative. We could also return to a system of fixed exchange
rates, with or without relying on gold as the standard of value.
Or, most daring of all, we could establish an international cur-
rency.
Whichever arrangement is chosen, a number of problems need
to be resolved. First and foremost is the problem of international
capital movements. The transfer of capital across national fron-
tiers is highly desirable and ought to be encouraged; but specula-
tive capital movements, as we have seen, are cumulatively
destabilizing. We need a system that renders speculation unprof-
itable. Ideally, currency fluctuations ought to be kept within the
confines of interest rate differentials; but that would entail a sys-
tem of more or less fixed exchange rates.
Target zones are unlikely to discourage speculation. On the
contrary, they may constitute an invitation to speculate against
the authorities with limited risk. By endorsing a set of target
zones, the authorities would expose themselves to speculative
attack at a time and place chosen by the speculators. History
shows that under these conditions the speculators usually win. It
could be argued that an explicit target zone system constitutes the
worst of all possible worlds because it would reward speculation
within the system as well as encouragino speculative attacks
against the system.
Unannounced target zones have a somewhat better chance of
success. They would pit the authorities against speculators in an
intricate cat and mouse game that the authorities have a chance
of winning, provided they act in unison and mobilize larger re-

sources than speculatqrs. Since they control the ultimate weapon
-the printing press-their task is not impossible. A strong cur-
rency can always be prevented from appreciating futher provided
the central bank is willing to supply it in unlimited quantities.
The curious fact is tha! central banks have rarely had the nerve to
do so.
If the authorities sljcceeded in stablizing exchange rates, hot
money would eventually cool off and find its way into long-term
investment-an essential prerequisite for a sounder world econ-
omy. But stabilizing the relative values of the major currencies is
not enough: the value of all the currencies taken together must
also be kept stable if ~e are to avoid inflationary and deflationary
excesses on a worldwide scale. Gold has served as a stabilizer
throughout history and it may play that role again in one form or
another, although it has one great drawback at the present time:
the bulk of fresh supplies is produced by two prison administra-
tions-namely, South Africa and the Soviet Union. In any case,
the problem is not only one of finding a suitable monetary base;
given the reflexivity of credit, the credit structure that is erected
on that base also needs to be regulated. What is needed is an
institution that coordinates the growth of credit on a worldwide
scale: an international central bank.
At this point in the argument, the other major problem areas,
namely, international debt and commodity prices with special
reference to oil, also need to be considered. rYir
International Debt
The burden of accumulated debt continues to weigh heavily on
lenders and borrowers alike. It was hoped that they could grow
their way out of the problem, but calculations failed to take into
account the erosion of collateral values that occurs when debts
are liquidated. In the case of balance-of-payments loans, the col-
lateral consists of exports. Less developed countries export
mainly commodities that face inelastic demand: as they try to
increase their exports, commodity prices come under pressure.
Some of the major debtor countries managed to enter what I
have called Phase 3 of the adjustment process but others seem
permanently mired in a deficit position. Raising the production
of traditional export commodities has become a dead end. Other

avenues of growth need to be pursued. Exporting more sophisti-
I
cated products is one possibility, but it is running into the road
block of protectionism. That leaves domestic growth in less de-
veloped countries as the main route to recovery. Politically, it is
highly desirable, because the United States may be more willing
to absorb imports if exports showed some signs of picking up;
moreover, public opinion in debtor countries is increasingly in-
sistent on domestic growth.
The Baker Plan was designed to bring relief to heavily indebted
countries by increasing the flow of new lending. The funds would
come partly from international institutions, notably the World
Bank and the inter-American Development Bank, and partly from
commercial banks. Commercial banks were asked to pledge $20
I billion over three years. The loans would have cross-default
claims, which would make them more secure than purely com-
mercial loans. When the resources of the World Bank are ex-
hausted, the administration would go to Congress to ask for a
capital increase.
The plan is a step in the right direction, but it leaves two prob-
lems unresolved: one is the accumulation of additional debt by
the borrowing countries at a time when they cannot meet their
already existing obligations; the other is the accumulation of
doubtful loans on the books of the commercial banks at a time
when they already have too many such loans. The plan would
mitigate the second problem because a large portion of new loans
would come from government institutions, but it would not elim-
inate it altogether. On the other hand, it lays itself open to the
accusation that it constitutes a bailout for the banks. This will
make it difficult to get Congress to approve an increase in the
World Bank's capital.
It is clear that the plan does not go far enough. It fails to deal
with the legacy of past excesses. In the absence of government
intervention the accumulated debt would have been liquidated in
catastrophic fashion. If a policy of intervention is to succeed, it
must reduce the accumulated debt in an orderly manner.
The experience of the last few years shows that, once the weight
of accumulated debt passes a certain critical point, it cannot be
reduced by a normal process of adjustment. In most Latin Ameri-
can countries, adjustment has been pushed to the limits of endur-
ance and negative resource transfers have reached and already
passed their maximum. Nevertheless, external debt has continued

to accumulate and debt ratios have showed little, if any, improve-
ment. Moreover, internal debt has been rising at an alarming rate.
In every advanced economy, special legal procedures have been
established to deal with excessive indebtedness. Bankruptcy law
serves to assure the orgerly liquidation of bad debt without undue
economic disruption. We are badly in need of some kind of bank-
ruptcy procedure for ipternational debt.
The principles of a bankruptcy reorganization are simple. The
clock is stopped at a certain point in time. All existing assets and
obligations are thrown into a pot, to be sorted out in lengthy
litigation. In the meantime, the entity is allowed to function, if it
is viable, free of the burdens of the past. The obligations of the
ongoing entity take precedence over the obligations of its prede-
cessor. It is this principle that allows the bankrupt entity to con-
tinue functioning.
,
International lending knows no equivalent procedure for set-
tling bad debt. There have been many precedents where debts
have not been paid in,full. Usually, nonpayment has resulted in
total default and the situation was normalized only several de-
cades later, when the lenders were happy to settle for a few cents
on the dollar. The most comprehensive attempts at debt reorgan-
ization without total default were the Dawes and Young plans for
Germany in 1924 and 1929, respectively, and they did not have a
happy outcome.
The example of domestic bankruptcy procedure$Ts not directly
applicable to the present situation because the amounts involved
are so large that, if payments were suspended even temporarily,
the lenders would also go bust; but the principle of drawing a line
under the past is the correct one.
At present, all market participants are aware of an unresolved
problem. Foreign lenders seek to keep their commitments to the
minimum and domestic capital seeks shelter abroad. The econo-
mies of the heavily indebted countries continue to languish and
political pressures intensify. These trends need to be reversed.
We are dealing with a reflexive process. A reversal of trend re-
quires a climactic event whose impact is sufficient to alter the
prevailing bias. Only a comprehensive scheme of reorganization
would constitute such an event.
I am not in a position to put forward a concrete plan of action.
Such a plan would require a great deal of preparation and negoti-
ation. All I can do here is to provide a rough sketch of what it

may look like. It will have to deal with at least five major topics:
I
(1) the treatment of preexisting debt; (2) the provision of new
credit; (3) the preservation of the banking system; (4) economic
policies in the debtor countries; and (5) the repatriation of flight
capital and the attraction of foreign investment. Senator Bradley
proposed a plan in June 1986 that touches on all of these p0ints.l
Henry Kaufman outlined a plan very similar to my own on De-
cember 4, 1986.2T hese contributions are moving the discussion
in the right direction.
The preexisting debt could be consolidated into long-term ne-
gotiable bonds with concessionary interest rates. The bonds
would sell at a fraction of their par value and the banks holding
the bonds would suffer substantial losses. To protect them, banks
I would be allowed to write down their bonds to the market value
gradually over a period of years. During that time the bonds could
be used at their gradually depreciating official value as collateral
for borrowing at the discount window of the central bank. This
would prevent a run on those banks whose financial positions
had been impaired by the reorganization: they would be allowed
to earn their way out of a hole.
To reorganize preexisting debt is not enough; a continuing flow
of new credit must be secured to enable the heavily indebted
countries to recover. Commercial banks cannot be counted on.
They should not have provided credit for balance-of-payments
purposes in the first place; they have learned their lesson and
would be unwilling to lend even if they did not suffer any losses
on their existing commitments. Balance-of-payments lending
ought to be the province of an international lending institution
that has the clout to insist that borrowing countries follow appro-
priate economic policies.
At present, the major internal problem in the heavily indebted
countries is inflation. As long as the servicing of foreign debt
generates a large budget deficit there is little hope of curbing it.
But once the debt burden is reduced, domestic reforms would
have a better chance of succeeding. With less inflation real inter-
est rates would rise, flight capital would be encouraged to return,
and perhaps even foreign capital could be attracted once again.
To provide an adequate flow of new credit, the World Bank (or
a new institution designed for the purpose) would need a large
amount of capital. At present, the political will to make the nec-
essary capital available is missing: any enlargement of interna-

tional financial institutions would be perceived as a bailout for
the banks or for the debtor countries or for both. A comprehensive
scheme that would require both creditors and debtors to contrib-
ute to the limits of their abilities ought to be able to overcome
these objections. The new loans would not go to service existing
debt; they would serve to stimulate the world economy at a time
when the liquidation of bad debts is having a depressing effect
and stimulation is badiy needed.
Oil
There is a painless way in which the capital needed by the World
Bank could be obtained. It involves a grand design that combines
an oil stabilization scheme with a solution to the international
debt problem. I first thought of it in 1982. I outlined it in an article
that was rejected with scathing comments and never published. It
was considered too far-fetched then and it will probably be con-
sidered the same today. The interesting point about the article is
that the problem that prompted its writing has not gone away.
The article is just as timely now as it was when it was written.
The reader can judge for himself because I shall reproduce it more
or less verbatim.

AN INTERNATIONAL BUFFER STOCK SCHEME FOR OIL *
This article will outline what could be achieved by interna-
tional cooperation if the willingness to cooperate were present.
There are many possibilities: I shall focus on the optimum that
could be achieved. The point in doing so is to show that a work-
able solution is conceivable. This may help generate the will to
put it into effect.
The optimum solution would require an agreement between the
major oil-importing and oil-exporting countries. It would replace
OPEC with an organization that would combine the essential fea-
tures of a cartel-price fixing and production quotas-with those
of an international buffer stock scheme.
It is not necessary or even desirable that all the consuming and
producing countries should participate. Cooperation of the indus-
trialized countries and the "moderate" members of OPEC is indis-
* Written in 1982.

pensable, but the scheme could work without including
t producers like Iran, Libya, or Algeria.
The scheme would work as follows. Production and consump-
tion quotas would be established. The aggregate amount of the
quotas would be in excess of the present level of consumption.
The excess would go into a buffer stock. Since it is expensive to
store oil, the buffer stock would exist mainly on paper: the oil
would be kept in the ground.
Payment would be made not directly to the producing country
but into a blocked account at a special facility of the IMF. The
funds would be held in favor of the producing countries whose
production quotas were not filled by actual sales. The oil would
be paid for by those consuming countries that did not fill their
consumption quotas with actual purchases. It would be held on
the books of the buffer stock authority at the disposal of the coun-
try that paid for it. The buffer stock authority, in turn, would hold
the oil in the ground of the producing country until needed. Ob-
viously, the buffer stock authority would have to be satisfied that
the oil in the ground is secure.
The consuming countries would impose a levy on imported oil.
They would rebate a portion of the oil levy to those producing
countries that participate in the scheme. Nonparticipating pro-
ducers would not be entitled to a rebate to penalize them for not
participating. The rebates would also be deposited into the
blocked accounts at the special facility of the IMF. The blocked
accounts would bear interest at a very low rate, say 1%.
Producers with large outstanding debts, such as Mexico, Vene-
zuela, Nigeria, and Indonesia, could use their blocked accounts
to repay their debt; countries with surpluses, such as Saudi Ara-
bia and Kuwait, would build up credit balances.
Less developed countries would be exernpted from having to
participate in the buffer stock scheme. They would then have the
advantage of being able to buy oil at a cheaper price than the
industrialized countries. Their absence would not endanger the
scheme.
For purposes of illustration, let us assume that the benchmark
price were kept at $34; the levy would be quite large, say, $17,
half of which, $8.50, would be rebated to producers. Quotas
would be fixed quite high so that the buffer stock started accu-
mulating at a daily rate of say 3 million barrels. If the industrial-
ized countries were importing oil at a rate of only 15 million
barrels a day, and 80% of the oil came from participating produc-
ers, they would realize $55.8 billion a year from the levy and pay
out $28 billion for buffer stock purchases. The rest would contrib-

ute to a reduction of budget deficits putting the industrialized
countries in a favorable position to provide the necessary equity
capital to an enlarged World Bank. The IMF special facility would
receive $65 billion a year, all for the credit of producing countries:
$37.2 billion from the producers' share of the oil levy and $28
billion from the buffbr stock. By comparison, the net increase of
international lending was about $60 billion at its peak in 1980
and 1981. I
What would happen to the market price of oil? Since the
blocked account pays only 1% interest, there is an inducement to
make physical sales rather than sales to the buffer stock. The price
paid by the buffer stock would therefore serve as a ceiling: the
free market price would settle somewhere below the benchmark
price, less the unrebated portion of the levy, that is, $25.50. For
consumers and producers in the industrialized countries, the
price would of course include the levy. Should the price rise
above the benchmark it would be an indication that demand is
strong and it would be time to raise production quotas.
How to adjust quotas and prices presents a gamut of tough
problems. Most atterhpts at market regulation flounder because a
suitable adjustment mechanism is lacking. This is true even of
the international monetary system: the Bretton Woods arrange-
ment broke down because of the inflexibility of the price of gold.
The more the scheme relies on price as the adjustment mecha-
nism, the better its chances of survival. Recognizing this princi-
ple, the buffer stock should be used only to give the price
mechanism time to do its work. That means that afterthe initial
buildup of a buffer stock, whenever it is beginning to be drawn
upon there would be an upward adjustment, first in production
quotas and then in prices. When the buffer stock is beginning to
build up again, there would be a reduction in production quotas
down to the minimum established at the outset.
The allocation of production quotas is one of the thorniest prob-
lems. Initial quotas would be based on the irreducible financial
needs of the countries involved; as the global amount of produc-
tion is increased the allocation of the increased amounts would
have to be guided more by considerations of unused production
capacity, size of reserves, and rate of increase or decrease of re-
serves. The Saudi quota, for instance, would have to rise more
than the Algerian or Venezuelan. Even if some formula could be
developed, there would be a large element of discretionary judg-
ment involved.
Eventually, as production capacity is more fully utilized, the
unwillingness of individual producers to increase their quota

Prescription
could serve as the trigger mechanism for increasing prices. Again
there would be an element of judgment involved.
The allocation of consumption quotas would be quite simple
by comparison: estimates using actual consumption figures could
serve as the basis.
To exercise discretionary powers, authority is required. How
such an authority would be constituted and the voting rights di-
vided presents the most difficult question of all. It can be settled
only by hard bargaining; the outcome would reflect the bargaining
power and bargaining skills of the parties involved.
Undoubtedly, there would be a major shift of power from the
oil-producing to the industrialized countries. That is only appro-
priate when OPEC is being saved from collapse. It is my conten-
tion that the collapse of OPEC would have such calamitous
consequences that it would have to be prevented one way or
another. One of the major arguments in favor of embarking on the
comprehensive scheme outlined here is that the industrialized
countries might as well gain the maximum benefit from a devel-
opment that they would have to acquiesce in anyhow. How much
they can gain depends on the skill, courage, and cohesion they
demonstrate. The scheme outlined here would be much more
advantageous than patching up OPEC.
The ultimate merit of the scheme would depend on how the
funds accumulating at the IMF special facility would be used.
The amounts involved are very large: larger than the accumula-
tion of international debt at its peak; they would remain very large
even when the buffer stock stopped growing. The funds should
be sufficient to finance a global reorganization plan for sovereign
debt.
The blocked funds held by the IMF would be lent to the World
Bank to provide credit to hecsrily indebted countries; they could
also be used to buy up their outstanding debt at a discount. The
cash income earned on these loans could, in turn, be used to
unblock the blocked accounts at the IMF.
How would the various parties to the scheme fare? That would
depend largely on the terms arrived at by negotiations. Neverthe-
less, the broad outlines are clear.
The industrialized countries would give up the benefits of a
lower oil price in the near term in exchange for long-range price
stability, the accumulation of a buffer stock, a solution for the
international debt problem, and a significant contribution to gov-
ernment revenues. They would also have the benefit of protecting
their domestic energy and oil sewice industries, if any.
Producing countries that participated would be assured of a

market for their oil production at a volume substantially higher
than at present. The price they receive would be less than at
present, but higher than it would be if OPEC collapsed. They
would have two powerful inducements to participate: the rebate
on the oil levy and the ability to sell to the buffer stock. It is true
that both would be palid into blocked accounts at the IMF, but oil-
producing countries *with debts would have access to the ac-
counts for debt repayinent purposes; those with surpluses would
have their funds unblocked only after a long delay.
The less developed non-oil-producing countries would obtain
substantial relief from being able to buy oil at a cheaper price
than industrialized countries. Both producing and consuming
countries would behefit from the global debt reorganization
scheme.
This article does not deal with the problem of how such a
comprehensive scheme could be brought into existence-how
one could get from here to there. Probably it would require a
worse crisis than is currently visible to bring the various parties
together.
The plan outlined above would have to be revised in the light
of changed circumstances. Both the benchmark price and the size
of the levy would have to be substantially lower than the figures
used above, reflecting the erosion in OPEC's monopoly profits
that has occurred since the scheme was formulated.
I am reluctant to invest any effort in revising the Pfan because I
recognize that it is totally unrealistic, given the prevailing bias.
Any kind of buffer scheme would be instantly laughed out of
court, and the dismissal would be justified by the past history of
buffer stock schemes. But the argument can be turned around. Is
the experience with the market mechanism any better? Look at
the history of oil. The only periods of stability were those when
there were excess supplies and a cartel-type arrangement was in
operation. There were three such episodes: first, the monopoly
established by Standard Oil; second, the production quota system
operated by the Texas Railroad Commission; and third, OPEC.
Each episode was preceded and followed by turmoil. If some sort
of stabilization scheme is necessary, should the task be left to the
producers? Ought not the consuming countries, whose vital inter-
ests are affected, take a hand in the arrangements? When the force
of this argument is recognized, it will be time to take the plan out
of the drawer.

An International Currency
Once the idea of a buffer stock scheme for oil is accepted, it is a
relatively short step to the creation of a stable international cur-
rency. The unit of account would be based on oil. The price of oil
would be kept stable by the buffer stock scheme although its
value, in terms of other goods and services, may gradually appre-
ciate if and when demand outstrips supply. In other words, na-
tional currencies would gradually depreciate in terms of the
international currency.
The newly created international lending agency would use oil
as its unit of account. Since its loans would be protected against
h inflation, they could carry a low rate of interest, say, 3%. The
difference between interest earned (3%) and interest paid on
blocked accounts could be used to unblock the accounts. As
the blocked accounts diminish, the lending agency builds up its
own capital.
The lending agency could be endowed with the powers that
usually appertain to a central bank. It could regulate the world-
wide money supply by issuing its own short-term and long-term
obligations, and it could play a powerful role in regulating the
volume of national currencies in terms of its own unit of account.
It could exercise the various supervisory functions that are per-
formed by central banks. Its unit of account would constitute an
international currency.
Commercial loans could also be designated in the international
currency. Eventually, the oil-based currency could replace the
dollar and other national currencies in all types of international
financial transactions. The transition would have to be carefully
orchestrated and the institutional framework developed. This is
not the place, and I am not the man, to design a comprehensive
scheme. It is clear that an oil-based currency could eliminate
speculative influences from international capital transfers.
Whether the establishment of such a currency would be accept-
able to all parties concerned is the crucial question. The United
States, in particular, has much to lose if the dollar ceased to be
the main international currency. For one thing, the home country
of the reserve currency is in an advantageous position to render
financial services to the rest of the world. More important, the
United States is at present the only country that can borrow un-

limited amounts in its own currency. If the dollar were replaced
by an international currency, the United States could continue
borrowing, but it would be obliged to repay its debt in full. At
present, it is within the power of the U.S. government to influence
the value of its own ipdebtedness and it is almost a foregone
conclusion that the indebtedness will be worth less when it is
repaid than it was at the time when it was incurred.
There are limits to the willingness of the rest of the world to
finance the U.S. budget deficit and we may be currently approach-
ing these limits. But the Japanese, for one, seem content to finance
the United States even in the knowledge that they will never be
repaid ir, full, because that is the way in which Japan can become
"number one" in the world. Japan has already taken over the role
of the United States as the major supplier of capital to the rest of
the world and it is only a question of time before the yen takes
over as the major reserve currency. The transition is likely to be
accompanied by a lot of turmoil and dislocations, as was the
transition from the pound sterling to the dollar in the interwar
period.
The introduction of an international currency would avoid the
turmoil. Moreover, it would help, arrest the decay of the U.S.
economy currently under way. We could no longer run up exter-
nal debt on concessionary terms; therefore we would be forced to
put our house in order. The question is whether our government
has the foresight, and our people the will, to accept the discipline
that an international currency would impose. Renouncing credit
on easy terms makes sense only if we are determined to borrow
less. That means that we must reduce both our budget and our
trade deficits. It is at this point that the quastions of systemic
reform and economic policy become intertwined.
As far as trade is concerned, there are two alternative ways to
go. One is to exclude imports through protectionsist measures,
and the other is to increase our exports. Protectionism is a recipe
for disaster. It would precipitate the wholesale default of heavily
indebted countries and lead to the unraveling of the international
financial system. Even in the absence of financial calamity, the
elimination of comparative advantages would cause a substantial
lowering of living standards throughout the world. On the other
hand, it is difficult to see how exports can be significantly in-
creased without systemic reform. Debt reform would increase the
purchasing power of debtor countries and monetary reform

would provide the element of stability that is necessary for a
t successful adjustment process in the U.S.
It can be argued that excessive financial instability is doing
great damage to the fabric of the American economy. Real assets
cannot adjust to macroeconomic changes as fast as financial as-
sets; hence there is a great inducement to transfer real assets into
a financial form. This transfer is itself a major factor in weakening
the "real" economy. When we examine how financial assets are
employed we gain a true measure of the devastation that has oc-
curred. The bulk of the assets is tied up in the Federal budget
deficit, loans to heavily indebted countries, and leveraged buy-
outs. "Real" capital forni~eianis act.cla1l-y declinicg. That w~uld
not be so disastrous if we could count on a steady flow of income
from abroad. But our trade deficit is financed partly by debt ser-
I
vice from less developed countries, which is precarious to say the
least, and partly by capital inflows, which we shall have to service
in turn. It is not an exaggeration to say that the "real" economy is
being sacrificed to keep the "financial" economy afloat.
To reduce our dependence on capital inflows, the budget deficit
needs to be tackled. The most alluring prospect, in my eyes, is a
disarmament treaty with the Soviet Union on advantageous
terms. The period of heavy defense spending under President
Reagan could then be justified as a gigantic gamble that has paid
off: the Imperial Circle would be replaced by a more stable config-
uration in which both our budget and our trade are closer to
balance.
The Japanese can, of course, continue to produce more than
they consume. There is nothing to stop them from becoming the
premier economic power in the world as long as they are willing
to save and to export capital. But the rise of Japan need not be
accompanied by the fall of the United States; with the help of an
international currency, two leading economic powers could co-
exist.

THE PARADOX OF SYSTEMIC REFORM
I have provided the outlines not only of a viable international
financial system but also of a viable economic policy for the
United States. It is no more than a sketch or a vision but it could
be elaborated to cover other aspects that I have not touched upon
here.
Two fundamental problems present themselves; one is abstract,
and the other personal. The abstract problem concerns all at-
tempts at systemic reform. Given our inherently imperfect under-
standing, isn't there a paradox in systemic reform? How can we
hope to design an internally consistent system? The personal
problem concerns my aversion to bureaucracy; awhternational
central bank would make bureaucracy inescapable.
I believe the paradox of systemic reform is spurious but it needs
to be dealt with. Only if one could demand permanent and perfect
solutions would it have any validity. But it follows from our im-
perfect understanding that permanent and perfect solutions are
beyond our reach. Life is temporary; only death is permanent. It
makes a great deal of difference how we live our lives; temporary
solutions are much better than none at all.
There is a great temptation to insist on a permanent solution.
To understand its source, we must consider the meaning of life
and death. The fear of death is one of the most deeply felt human
emotions. We find the idea of death totally unacceptable and we
grasp at any straw to escape it. The striving for permanence and
perfection is just one of the ways in which we seek to escape
death. It happens to be a deception. Far from escaping theidea of
death, we embrace it: permanence and perfection are death.

==================================================

342 Prescription
I have thought about the meaning of life and death long and
1 hard and I have come up with a formulation that I have found
personally satisfying. I shall sum it up here, although I realize
that it may not be as meaningful to others as it is to me, The key
is to distinguish between the fact of death and the idea of death.
The fact of death is linked with the fact of life, whereas the idea
of death stands in juxtaposition with the idea of consciousness.
Consciousness and death are irreconcilable; but life and death are
not. In other words, the fact of death need not be as terrifying as
the idea.
The idea of death is overpowering: in terms of death, life and
everything connected with it lose a1 significance. BQP the idea of
death is only an idea and the correspondence between facts and
ideas is less than perfect. It would be a mistake to equate the idea
I
and the fact. As far as facts are concerned, the clear and present
fact is that we are alive. Death as a fact looms in the distance, but,
when we reach it, it will not be the same as the idea we have of it
now. In other words, our fear of death is unlikely to be validated
by the event.
In thinking about life and death, we have a choice: we can take
life or death as our starting point. The two are not mutually exclu-
sive: both need to be dealt with-as a fact and as a thought. But
the point of view we adopt tends to favor one or the other. The
bias we develop permeates all aspects of our thinking and exis-
tence. There are civilizations, like that of the Egyptians, that seem
to be devoted to the cult of death; there are others, like that of the
Greeks, where even the immortals seem to lead normal lives. In
most instances the two points of view are at odds and the inter-
play between them makes history. The conflict between the spir-
itual and the temporal in Christianity is a case in point. The
drama is now being reenacted in the Soviet Union where the
demands of Communist ideology are difficult to reconcile with
the demands of military strength and economic efficiency.
The clash of biases can manifest itself in many more subtle
ways. Thus, we can take different attitudes with regard to eco-
nomic regulation. One position is that regulation is useless be-
cause it introduces distortions that, left to themselves, eventually
lead to a breakdown of the system. This point of view is power-
fully reinforced by the argument that the market mechanism, left
to itself, tends toward equilibrium. The opposite point of view is
that perfection is not attainable either by the market or by regula-

tion. Markets are too unstable, regulation too rigid. Markets need
to be regulated but regulation cannot be left to itself either: it is in
constant need of revision. The fact that no system is perfect is not
a valid argument against trying to perfect the system. Take Bretton
Woods: the fact that it eventually broke down does not alter the
fact that it provided tlie basis for a quarter of a century of prosper-
ity.
When it comes to a' choice between the two attitudes, mine is
clearly in favor of life and the temporary and imperfect structures
we can create within it. Although I advocate a comprehensive
reform of the financial system, I have no illusions that the new
system will be any more flawless or permanent than the preceding
ones. On the contrary: I regard the search for permanence and
perfection as an illusion. The pitfall in a well-functioning system
is that it lulls us into complacency. That is what happened to
Bretton Woods, and that is what will happen to the next one if we
design it too well.
This brings me to the personal problem I have with systemic
reform. Systems are operated by bureaucrats, and I have an in-
stinctive aversion to the bureaucratic mentality. In advocating a
more regulated international financial system I seem to be wish-
ing for something that I abhor.
The problem is real. The distinctive feature of every bureau-
cracy is its striving for self-perpetuation. Every system faces the
danger that it becomes ossified in the hands of the bureaucracy
that administers it. This holds true for Christianity as well as
communism. The dead hand of bureaucracy is difficult to escape.
Mao Tse-tung tried it by instigating the Cultural Revolution and
the consequences were disastrous.
But the problem is not insurmountable. When bureaucrats are
in charge of a market, market action serves to keep the bureaucrats
on their toes. Experience shows that central banks are among the
most flexible, innovative, and efficient institutions. The reason is
that the market provides a criterion by which the results of their
actions can be judged. They may come under the influence of false
ideologies, just like anybody else, but when a policy does not
work, they cannot help but notice it. For instance, the Federal
Reserve adopted a monetarist stance in 1979, but abandoned it in
August 1982. Similarly, the IMF operated with a rather rigid set
of prescriptions in dealing with heavily indebted countries, but
gradually it has been forced to abandon a formula that does not

work. Central banks are often criticized for following the wrong
1
policies; but the very fact that the failures can be demonstrated
provides a potent discipline. Moreover, central banks have been
surprisingly innovative in handling crises. The Bank of England
invented the "lifeboat" in 1974, and the Federal Reserve applied
it on a worldwide scale in the debt crisis of 1982. Volcker, in
particular, proved to be a man who thrives on crises; but the fact
that a man like Volcker could be at the helm of a central bank
cannot be treated as an accident.*
In sum, the creation of an international central bank does not
constitute a permanent solution. Indeed, the very idea that it con-
stitutes a permanent solutiox carries with it the seeds of the next
crisis.

THE CRASH OF '87
The stock market crash'of 1987 is an event of historic significance.
One must go back to the crashes of 1929, 1907 or 1893 to find a
comparison. In many ways the most relevant is 1929, and it is
also the most widely hown; but in drawing the comparison we
must be careful not to confuse the crash itself with its aftermath.
In the crash of 1929; the New York stock market fell by about
(36%;t his figure is almost identical with the loss that occurred in
W87. Subsequently, stbcks recovered nearly half their losses, and
then declined by another 80% in the long-drawn-out bear market
between 1930 and 1932. It is that bear market, assoekted with the
Great Depression, which preys on the public imagination. Exactly
because it is so well remembered, we can be sure that history will
not repeat itself. The immediate governmental reaction to the
crash already bears out this contention. After 1929, :he monetary
authorities made a momentous mistake by not supplying enough
liquidity; in the present case, they will make a different mistake.
On the basis of their initial reaction, the danger is that they will
destroy the stability of the dollar in their effort to avoid a reces-
sion, at least in an election year.
Technically, the crash of 1987 bears an uncanny resemblance
to the crash of 1929. The shape and extent of the decline and even
the day-to-day movements of stock prices track very closely. The
major difference is that in 1929 the first selling climax was fol-
lowed within a few days by a second one which carried the mar-
ket to a lower low. In 1987, the second climax was avoided, and
even if the market were to establish new lows in the future, the

pattern would be different. The divergence bears witness to the
I determination of the authorities not to repeat the mistake of 1929.
In the early stages of the crash President Reagan sounded remark-
ably like President Hoover, but by the time of his press conference
on Thursday, October 22, he had been carefully coached to avoid
the resemblance.
The crash of 1987 came just as unexpectedly as the crash of
1929. There had been a general awareness that the worldwide
boom was unsound and unsustainable, but few people got their
timing right. I was as badly caught as the next fellow. I was con-
vinced that the crash would start in Japan; that turned out to be
an expensive =istake.
In retrospect, it is easy to reconstruct the sequence of events
that led to the crash. The boom had been fed by liquidity; it was
t
a reduction in liquidity that established the preconditions for a
crash. In this respect also 1987 resembles 1929: it will be recalled
that the crash of 1929 was preceded by a rise in short-term money
rates.
Exactly how the reduction in liquidity came about in 1987 is a
thornier question, to which one cannot give a definitive answer
without a great deal of research. One thing is clear: the agreement
to defend the dollar played a crucial role. In the first few months
following the Louvre Accord of February 1987, the dollar was
defended by sterilized intervention; that is to say, domestic inter-
est rates were not allowed to be affected. When the central banks
found that they had to acquire more dollars than they had appe-
tite for, they changed their tactics. After Nakasone's visit to Wash-
ington of April 29-May 2, 1987, they allowed interest-rate
differentials to widen to levelis a), which the private sector was
willing to hold dollars; in effect, they "privatized" the interven-
tion.
What is not so clear yet is whether it was the sterilized or the
unsterilized intervention that led to the reduction in liquidity.
Sterilized intervention transferred large amounts of dollars to the
coffers of the central banks, and the Federal Reserve may have
failed to inject the equivalent amounts into the domestic money
market. In that case, the effect would have made itself felt with a
lag of several months. Alternatively, it may be that the monetary
authorities in Japan and Germany got cold feet about the inflation-
ary implications of unsterilized intervention and it was their at-
tempt to rein in their domestic money supply that led to the
worldwide rise in interest rates.

==================================================

The Crash of '87 347
I favor the latter explanation, although I cannot rule out the
possibility that the former was also a contributing factor. The
Germans are well known to harbor a strong anti-inflationary bias.
The Japanese are more pragmatic, and they did, in fact, allow their
interest rates to fall after Nakasone's return to Tokyo. But when
they found that an easy-money policy was merely reinforcing the
already unhealthy speculation in financial assets, including land,
they had second thoughts. They tried to slow down the growfh of
the Japanese domestic money supply and bank lending; but spec-
ulation was out of control by then. Even after the Bank of Japan
started to rein in the qoney supply, the bond market continued
to soar, and the yield on the bellwether Coupon #89 issue fell to
only 2.6% in May before the bond market crashed in September,
1987.
The collapse of the Japanese bond market was the first in a
sequence of events that will enter the annals of history as the
Crash of 1987. There were large speculative long positions in
September bond futures which could not be liquidated. Hedging
led to a collapse of the December futures, and the yield on the
Coupon #89 issue rose to more than 6% before the bottom was
reached. I thought that the collapse would carry over into the
stock market, which was even more overvalued than the bond
market, but I was wrong. Speculative money actually moved from
bonds to stocks in a vain attempt to recoup the losses. As a result,
the Japanese stock market reached minor new highsin October.
The consequences for the rest of the world were more grievous.
The government bond market in this country had become depen-
dent on Japanese buying. When the Japanese turned sellers, even
in relatively small quantities, our bond market sufferad a sinking
spell which went beyond any change justified by economic fun-
damentals. Undoubtedly our economy was somewhat stronger
than had been expected, but the strength was in industrial pro-
duction rather than in final demand. Commodity prices were ris-
ing, encouraging inventory accumulation and raising the specter
of inflation. The fear of inflation was more a rationalization for
the decline in bonds than its root cause; nevertheless, it served to
reinforce the downtrend in the bond market.
The weakness in bonds widened the disparity between bond
and stock prices that had been developing since the end of 1986.
Such a disparity can persist indefinitely, as it did, for instance, in
the 1960s, but as it widens it creates the preconditions for an
eventual reversal. The actual timing of the reversal is determined

by a confluence of other events. In this case, political considera-
t tions played a major role: President Reagan had lost his luster and
the elections were approaching. The decisive factor was the re-
newed pressure on the dollar; and the internal instabilities of the
stock market converted a decline into a rout.
The first crack came when a well-known and widely followed
"guru," Robert Prechter, gave a bearish signal before the opening
on October 6 and the market responded with a resounding fall of
some 90 points. This was a sign of underlying weakness, but
similar incidents had occurred in 1986 without catastrophic con-
sequences. The situation deteriorated when the dollar also started
to weaken. On Tuesday, October 13, Alan Greenspan, Chairman
of the Federal Reserve, announced that the trade balance showed
signs of a "profound structural improvement." The figures pub-
I
lished on Wednesday, October 14, were all the more disappoint-
ing. The dollar came under severe selling pressure. The principle
of unsterilized intervention would have required a rise in interest
rates which would have been all the larger because of the rises
that had occurred in Japan and Germany. The U.S. authorities
were unwilling to undertake such a tightening, and by Thursday,
as the stock market continued to decline, Treasury Secretary
James Baker was reported to be pressing the Germans to lower
their interest rates lest the dollar be allowed to fall. The stock
market decline continued to accelerate amid reports that the
House Ways and Means Committee was planning to limit the tax
deductibility of junk bonds issued in leveraged buy-outs. Al-
though the provision was abandoned by Friday, stocks that had
been bid up in the expectation of a "corporate event" declined
sufficiently to force the liquidation of positions held on margin
by professional arbitrage traders.
Then came the sensational lead article in the Sunday edition of
The New York Times in which Treasury officials were reported to
be openly advocating a lower dollar and blaming the Germans in
advance for the stock market fall which these remarks helped to
precipitate. Some selling pressure on Monday, October 19, was
inevitable because of the built-in instabilities; but the New York
Times article had a dramatic effect, exacerbating the instabilities
which had been allowed to accumulate. The result was the largest
decline ever on a single day: the Dow Jones average lost 508
points, or 22% of its value.

devices allow, in principle, the individual participant to limit his

risk at the cost of enhancing the instability of the system. In prac-
tice, the breakdown of 'the system did not allow the individual to
escape unscathed. The market became disorganized, panic set in
and the forced liquidation of collateral further compressed market
values.
The collapse in ~ e Y&ork had repercussions abroad, and the
collapse of other markets affected New York in turn. London
turned out to be more' vulnerable than New York, and the nor-
mally staid Swiss market was even worse affected. Worst of all
was Hong Kong, where a group of speculators in the futures mar-
ket managed to arrange for a suspension of trading on the stock
exchange for the rest of the week in the vain hope that they might
be able to force a settlement of the futures contract at an artificial
price. The ploy failed, the speculators were wiped out and the
futures market had to be rescued by Government intervention.
During the week that the Hong Kong market was suspended, sell-
ing from Hong Kong radiated to the other Australasian npkets
and to London. The selling pressure persisted for the better part
of two weeks after Black Monday. While other stock markets con-
tinued to reach new lows, the New York market did not exceed
the lows set in the initial selling climax.
The only stock market that escaped collapse was Japan's. There
was a one-day panic following Black Monday, when prices fell
the limit without many transactions taking place. (In Japan, daily
price movements are limited by regulations.) Japanese stocks
traded at large discounts in London the next morning; but by the
time the Japanese market reopened the next day, the Ministry of
Finance had made a few phone calls, the sell orders miraculously
disappeared and large ixstitutions were aggresshe buyers. As a
result, the market recouped a large part of the previous day's
losses. Prices sagged further after the panic, and at the time of the
gigantic Nippon Telephone & Telegraph issue, which involved
raising about $37 billion from the public, it looked as if the market
might unravel. But the authorities intervened again, this time per-
mitting the four large brokers to trade for their own accounts-in
effect, giving them a license to manipulate the market.
The two outstanding features of the Crash of 1987, then, are the
absence of a second selling climax in New York and the relative
stability of Tokyo. These two features deserve further exploration,
because they can provide some insight into consequences of the
crash.

350 Prescription
' The historic significance of the crash of 1929 derived from the
fact that it precipitated the Great Depression. It occurred during a
period when economic and financial power was moving from
Europe to the United States. The shift in power caused a great
deal of instability in exchange rates, and the end result was that
the dollar supplanted sterling as the international reserve cur-
rency; but the crash of 1929 itself played no clearly defined role
in the process.
By contrast, the historic significance of the Crash of 1987 lies
in the fact that it marks the transfer of economic and financial
power from the United States to Japan. Japan has been producing
more than it consumes, t;nd the Ucitsd States has been consuming
more than it produces for some time past. Japan has been accu-
mulating assets abroad, while the United States has been amass-
I
ing debts. The process received a great boost when President
Reagan took office with a program of cutting taxes and increasing
military expenditures (in this context, armaments are also a form
of consumption), and it has been gaining momentum ever since.
Both sides have been loath to acknowledge it: President Reagan
wanted to make Americans feel good about being American and
pursued the illusion of military superiority at the cost of render-
ing our leading position in the world economy illusory; while
Japan wanted to keep growing in the shadow of the United States
as long as possible.
The Crash of 1987 has revealed the strength of Japan and made
the transfer of economic and financial power clearly visible. It
was the collapse of the Japanese bond market that depressed our
own bond market and set up our stock market for a crash. Yet
Japan has been able to avert 3 collapse of its own stuck markst.
To top it all, our authorities have been able to avert a second
selling climax only by abandoning the dollar. Herein lies the sig-
nificance of the two features of the crash I have singled out for
special attention. Japan has, in effect, emerged as the banker to
the world-taking deposits from the rest of the world, and making
loans to and investing in the rest of the world. The dollar is no
longer qualified to serve as the international reserve currency.
Whether a new international currency system can be established
without a Great Depression remains an open question.
Events are notoriously more difficult to predict than to explain.
How can one anticipate decisions that have not yet been taken?
Nevertheless, one can evaluate the implications of the decisions
that have already been taken.

The Crash of '87 351
The Crash of 1987 confronted our Government with the ques-
tion: which do we conSider more important, averting a-recession
or preserving the value of the dollar? The response was unequiv-
ocal. By the middle of the second week after Black Monday, the
dollar had been cut loose from its moorings, and by the end of
that week Treasury Secretary James Baker made the news official.
The dollar moved obediently lower, and a second selling climax
in the stock market did not take place. The mistake of 1929 has
been avoided, but only at the peril of committing a different kind
of mistake. The decision to cut the dollar loose is painfully remi-
niscent of the competitive devaluations of the 1930s. Temporary
relief may be bought at ,the cost of greater damage later.
Prospects are good that a severe recession in the United States
can be avoided at least in the near future. Consumer spending was
already declining prior to the crash, and the crash is bound to
make consumers more cautious. But industrial production has
been benefiting from the lower dollar, and industrial employment
has been strong. The reduction in the budget deficit is too small
and too illusory to have much of an effect. If American corpora-
tions slash their capital expenditures, foreign corporations ex-
panding in the United States may take up the slack. It is unlikely,
therefore, that the downturn in consumption would develop into
much more than a flat first quarter or first half in 1988. Both
Germany and Japan are likely to stimulate their own economies.
The net result would be a continuation of the slos growth that
has prevailed in the world economy since 1983. It may come as a
surprise how little direct effect the stock market is going to have
on the real economy.
The trouble with this scenario is that it leaves the imbalances
that have precipitated the Crash of 1987 unresolved. Neither the
budget deficit nor the trade deficit of the United States is likely to
disappear. The aftermath of the crash may bring some temporary
respite, but eventually the dollar is bound to come under pressure
again-either because our economy is strong and the trade deficit
persists, or because it is weak and lower interest rates are needed
to stimulate it.
The United Kingdom found itself in a similar situation prior to
. the discovery of North Sea oil. The result was "stagflation" and a
sequence of "stop-go" policies. The same is in store for us now.
The major difference is that the United States is the largest econ-
omy in the world and its currency still serves as the international
medium of exchange. As long as the dollar remains unstable, in-

' ternational financial markets will remain accident-prone. It
should be recalled that while it was the Louvre Accord that cre-
ated the preconditions for a crash, it was the actual fall in the
dollar that precipitated it.
If the dollar continues to depreciate, owners of liquid assets
will be driven to take refuge elsewhere. Once the movement gath-
ers momentum, not even a rise in interest rates could arrest it,
because the rate of depreciation in the dollar would outweigh the
interest-rate differential in its favor. Eventually, the rise in inter-
est rates would bring on a more severe recession than the one that
the Administration sought to avoid.
It has happened before. In the last tvro years ~f the Carter Ad-
ministration, speculative capital continued to move to Germany
and Switzerland even when it had to pay a premium to be ac-
I
cepted there. The specter of a free-fall in the dollar is more real
today than it has been at any time since President Carter was
forced to sell bonds denominated in hard currencies in 1979.
Ever since the crash, stock markets worldwide have weakened
whenever the dollar weakened, and vice versa. The message is
clear: any further decline in the dollar would be counterproduc-
tive. The Administration seems to have received the message: all
talk of a lower dollar has ceased, and now that a budget compro-
mise of sorts has been accomplished, preparations are under way
for reestablishing the Louvre Accord. Much depends on how suc-
cessful the effort will be. Unfortunately, the Administration does
not bring much to the table: the budget cut has been described as
"a miserable pittance" by Senator Packwood. Moreover, the Crash
of 1987 has demonstrated conclusively that the Administration is
more concerned with avoiding a recession than with stabiiizing
the dollar. The burden of supporting the dollar will fall primarily
to our trading partners.
The best way for the Japanese to protect their export markets is
to transfer production to the dollar zone; the process had already
started prior to the crash. Many Japanese companies, led by the
car makers, are establishing manufacturing subsidiaries in the
United States and Mexico. The process will be accelerated by
the crash and the falling dollar, both of which make American
assets cheaper to acquire and the American market less profitable
to supply from abroad. The eventual solution of the trade deficit
will be import substitution-by Japanese manufacturers. It
echoes the solution to Europe's seemingly incurable "dollar gap"

after the Second World War. That was the time when many Amer-
ican corporations became "multinational" and the United States
consolidated its hegemony over the world economy. Similarly,
the birth of Japanese multinational corporations will coincide
with Japan's becoming the world's banker and economic leader.
Already, large-scalk Japanese investments give Japan consider-
able political leverage in the United States. Almost every state in
the Union has establibhed trade-promotion offices in Japan. Their
endeavors are not likely to make much headway if the Congress-
men representing the state are too vocal in supporting protection-
ist measures. In spite of all the posturing, protectionism may no
longer be a viable policy option. And in a few years' time, when
the Japanese have built their factories, they may become the most
ardent protectionists-to keep out competition from Korea and
Taiwan.
There have been many instances in the course of history when
economic and financial and, eventually, political and military
leadership passed from one country to another. The latest in-
stance was in the interwar period, when the United States sup-
planted Great Britain. Nevertheless, the prospect of Japan's
emerging as the dominant financial power in the world is very
disturbing, not only from the point of view of the United States
but also from that of the entire Western civilization.
From the narrowly American standpoint, the damage is too ob-
vious to deserve much elaboration. The loss of our preeminent
position is bound to engender a crisis in our sense of national
identity. Having just expended enormous sums in the pursuit of
military superiority, albeit these sums were borrowed abroad, we
are ill prepared to cope with the fact that we are losing our eco-
nomic superiority. Our sense of national identity is less firmly
grounded in tradition than in the case of Great Britain, so the
crisis is bound to be all the more deeply felt. The consequences
for our political behavior, both internally and internationally, are
incalculable.
The implications for our civilization are equally profound but
less obvious. The international trading system is an open system;
. its members are sovereign states which have to treat each other
on the basis of equality. That would not change if Japan takes over
leadership. On the contrary, the Japanese can be expected to step
more gingerly than the Americans have on occasion.

The problem is more subtle. The United States and Great Brit-
t ain are members of the same culture; that is not true of Japan. The
Japanese have shown tremendous capacity to learn and to grow,
but the society in which they live remains fundamentally differ-
ent from ours. The Japanese think in terms of subordination and
dominance. Contrast this with the notion that all men are created
equal, and the difference between the two cultures is brought into
focus.
Both the United States and Great Britain are open societies:
internally, people enjoy a large degree of freedom; externally, the
borders are open to the movement of goods, people, capital and
ideas to various degrees. Japan is still, to a large extent, a closed
society. The features of an open society, such as a democratic
fom of government, have been imposed by an occupying power
I
after a lost war. But the value system which permeates Japanese
society is a closed one: the interests of the individual are subor-
dinated to the interests of the social whole.
This subordination is not achieved through coercion; Japan
bears no resemblance whatsoever to a totalitarian state. It is
merely a country with a very strong sense of national mission and
social cohesion. The Japanese want to be part of a group that
strives to be number one, whether it is their company or their
nation; and they are willing to make considerable sacrifices in the
service of that goal. They cannot be faulted for holding such val-
ues; indeed, it is more appropriate to criticize Americans for their
unwillingness to suffer any personal inconvenience for the com-
mon good. Japan is a nation on the rise; we have become deca-
dent.
The question is, whether the United States in particular and tha
rest of the world in general will allow itself to be dominated by
an alien society with such a strong sense of national identity. The
question is troubling not only for us but also for the Japanese.
There is a strong school of thought that wants Japan to open up
in order to become more acceptable to the rest of the world. But
there is also a strong commitment to traditional values and an
almost pathological fear, especially in the older generation, that
Japan may lose its drive before it becomes number one. Japan is a
society in transition, and it may well become much more open as
it assumes the role of leadership. There are many internal ten-
sions and contradictions which tend to undermine social cohe-
sion and hierarchical values. Much depends on how fast the

transition occurs. If,t he United States proved itself somewhat
more viable than it has been of late, the value system of an open
society would also become more attractive to the Japanese.
The closed character of Japanese society manifests itself in
many areas. Formally a democracy, Japan has been ruled by one
party since its present constitution was introduced; the succes-
sion of prime mini4ters is determined by negotiations behind
closed doors. Although the domestic market is formally open,
foreign companies find it impossible to penetrate it without a
domestic ally. But nowhere is the difference between the open-
ness of the Western system and the closed character of the Japa-
nese more dramatidally demonstrated than in the financial
markets.
The Western world has gone overboard in allowing financial
markets to function unhindered by any government regulation.
That was a grievous mistake, as the Crash of 1987 has demon-
strated. Financial markets are inherently unstable; stability can
be maintained only if it is made an objective of public policy.
Instability is cumulative. As I have tried to show elsewhere in
this book, the longer markets are allowed to develop without reg-
ulation, the more unstable they become, until eventually they
crash.
The Japanese attitude toward financial markets is totally differ-
ent. The Japanese treat markets as a means to an end and manip-
ulate them accordingly. The authorities and ttfe institutional
players are connected by a subtle system of mutual obligation.
Recent events have provided an insight into the way the system
operates. The first time the market was set to collapse, after Black
Monday, a telephone call from the Ministry of Finance was suffi-
cient to rally the financial institutions. In the second instance, at
the time of the public issue of Nippon Telephone & Telegraph
shares, financial institutions proved less responsive, perhaps be-
cause the Ministry of Finance had used up its chits in the first
phone call. It now had to rely on the brokers, whose survival was
directly threatened. By giving them license to manipulate the
market, the authorities avoided disaster.
Whether a collapse can be avoided indefinitely is one of the
most fascinating questions about the current financial situation.
It still awaits an answer. The authorities have allowed a specula-
tive bubble to develop in Tokyo real estate and in the stock mar-
kets whose magnitude has few parallels in history. To illustrate,

,
Nippon Telephone & Telegraph shares were sold to the public at
270 times earnings, while American Telephone & Telegraph was
valued at 18 times. If this were a free market, it would have col-
lapsed already. There has been no example in history when a
bubble of this magnitude has been deflated in an orderly manner
without bursting. The authorities have been unable to prevent a
crash in the Japanese bond market, but they may be able to do so
in the stock market. The continuing strength of the yen works to
their advantage. If they succeed, it would represent a historic first,
the dawn of a new era in which financial markets are manipulated
for the benefit of the public good.
,
The effect of the crash was to move the Japanese stock market
nearer to being a closed system. Foreigners owned less than 5%
I of Japanese stocks at the outset of the crisis, and they dumped
much of their stock during and after it. The selling was absorbed,
interestingly, not so much by Japanese institutions as by the Jap-
anese public, which was encouraged by the brokers to go heavily
into debt. Japanese brokers did, in fact, speak of buying stocks
during the crisis as a patriotic duty whose accomplishment will
set Japan apart from the rest of the world. Margin debt is at an all-
time record. How to reduce the debt load without precipitating
forced liquidation of margin accounts is the task now confronting
the authorities.
Why did the Japanese authorities allow the speculative bubble
to develop in the first place? That is another fascinating question
about which one can only conjecture. There were external pres-
sures-the United States was pushing for lower interest rates in
Japan-but the Japanese would not have yielded if it had not
suited them.
At first, the inflation of financial assets allowed the authorities
to discharge their obligations toward the commercial banks at a
time when the real economy was in deep trouble. Without the
land and stock market boom, the commercial banks would have
seen many of their loans to industrial companies turn sour, and
their earnings would have suffered. Land and stock market spec-
ulation allowed them to expand their loan portfolios against
seemingly good collateral and also allowed the industrial com-
panies to make up for their earnings shortfall by earnings derived
from "zaitech"-that is, financial manipulation. The land boom
has also served another purpose: it helped to preserve a high
domestic savings rate and a favorable trade balance in spite of the

rise in the value of the yen. With the cost of housing rising faster
than wages, Japanese wage earners had good reason to save an
increasing portion of their income. With the domestic economy
in recession, the savings were available for investing abroad. That
was an ideal recipe for amassing wealth and power in the world,
even if the foreign investments depreciated in value. I suspect
that at least a fractioniof the Japanese power elite would be quite
pleased to see investors lose some money: it would prevent the
Japanese from going soft before Japan has become great. How else
can one explain the willingness of a democratic government to
sell shares to its electorate at obviously inflated prices?
But rising land and' stock prices soon started to have adverse
consequences. The high savings rate brought additional pressure
from abroad to stimulate the domestic economy, and the govern-
ment finally had to give in. Moreover, the gap between those who
owned land and those who did not widened to such an extent as
to threaten social cohesion. As soon as the domestic economy
began to recover, there was no need to allow banks to finance
speculative transactions; on the contrary, it was appropriate to
redirect their resources toward the real economy. The attempt to
rein in bank lending and the money supply set off the chain of
events I have reviewed earlier.
It is ironic that the Japanese should have a better understanding
of the reflexive character of the financial markets than the Western
world does, and it is regrettable that they shou1ct"be using it to
ensure the success of a closed system. If we don't like what is
happening, we should take steps to develop a viable alternative.
The stock market boom has diverted our attention from the
fundamental deterioration in the financial position of the United
States. With the frenetic activity in financial markets and the lure
of quick rewards, it was at least possible to pretend that the poli-
cies pursued by the Reagan Administration were working. The
Crash of 1987 comes as a rude awakening. Many of the profits
turned out to be illusory, and frenetic activity will soon be suc-
ceeded by the stillness of the morgue. Prospects are dismal. One
way or another, we face a reduction in living standards. Much
will depend on the route we choose.
The most likely path is the one I have outlined earlier. It is the
path followed by Great Britain before us, and it is likely to pro-
duce similar results as far as the United States is concerned. The

effect on the world economy may be much more negative because
of the importance of the dollar.
There is also a temptation to pursue a protectionist policy, but
for the reasons I have stated earlier, it is no longer a viable alter-
native. Nevertheless, it could do a lot of mischief.
Finally, there is the possiblity of reasserting the leadership we
failed to exercise. This would involve not only putting our own
house in order but also bringing a new international financial
order into existence which is appropriate to the altered circum-
stances.
We cannot have a smoothly functioning international economy
without a stable international currency. The monetary authorities
began to recognize this fact with the Plaza Agreement of October
4 1985 and reconfirmed it with the Louvre Accord of February
1987. Unfortunately, the steps they took were inadequate, and the
Louvre Accord fell apart in the Crash of 1987. Since the decision
to stabilize the dollar can be held responsible, one way or another,
for the crash, it is highly unlikely that the Louvre Accord can be
patched up. Whatever agreement is reached, its credibility will
have been diminished by the fact that when it came to the crunch,
the previous agreement had been abandoned. And it is highly
doubtful whether the Louvre Accord should be patched up-after
all, it did cause the Crash of 1987.
Trying to protect the currency at an unsustainable level can
plunge the country into protracted depression; that is what hap-
pened to Great Britain in 1926 when it returned to the gold stan-
dard at the prewar level.
It could be argued that the dollar is reasonably valued at
DM1.65 and Y132 to the dollar. This is true in the sense that a
further fall in its value would not bring any appreciable improve-
ment in the trade balance in the near term. But this was already
true when the dollar was 10% higher. The reason is that the ad-
justment process takes time, while a fall in the value of the cur-
rency has an immediate negative impactqthe famous J-curve
effect). Moreover, the more unstable the exchange rate, the more
reluctant people are to make the investments necessary to adjust
to it.
The argument only goes to prove that there is simply no realis-
tic exchange rate at which the dollar can continue fulfilling its
role as the international reserve currency: the dollar is unsound
at any price. Holders of financial assets seek the best store of

value, and the dollar no longer qualifies. A country with a large
budget deficit and a large trade deficit cannot expect foreigners to
accept an ever-increasing flow of its currency. Yet the interna-
tional financial system cannot function without a stable currency
as its foundation. This is the central lesson that emerges from the
Crash of 1987.
We desperately neqd an international currency system that is
not based on the dollar. Yet the yen is not yet ready to serve as
the international reserve currency-partly because the Japanese
financial markets are not sufficiently open, and partly because the
rest of the world is not ready to accept Japanese hegemony. The
ideal solution would be a genuine international currency, issued
and controlled by a genuine international bank. International
lending for balance-of-payments purposes would then be desig-
nated in the international currency, and the value of the currency
would be tied to gold br to a basket of commodities, ensuring that
debts would have to be repaid in full. Only when the dollar loses
its privileged status will the United States cease to flood the world
with dollars. The sooner we make the transition, the better the
chances of arresting the economic decline of the United States.
Unfortunately, we are not yet ready to learn the central lesson
of the crash. The prevailing wisdom still maintains that markets
are self-correcting and exchange rates ought to be allowed to find
their equilibrium levels. The Crash of '87 has, if anything, rein-
forced this line of thought. As a consequence, w c a n expect a
period of continuing turmoil in financial markets, although the
focus of attention may shift from the stock market to the currency
market and the bond market and, eventually, to the market for
precious metals.
The idealof an international currency and an international cen-
tral bank hgs few supporters. Ironically, it is likely to get a more
enthusiastic response in Japan than in the United States. There
are many people in Japan who would like their country to de-
velop into a more open society. The Japanese have still vivid
memories of the Second World War when they tried to go it alone.
They would much rather flourish within a worldwide trading and
financial system than embark on the impossible task of creating
their own. As newcomers, they would be willing to accept an
arrangement that does not fully reflect their current strength.
Yet it is the United States that has the most to gain from a
reform of the international currency system. It would allow us to

danger of losing. We are still in a position to strike a favorable
deal, especially in view of our military might. Most important, we
could preserve an open system in which Japan would be one of
the leading members, becoming a more open society in the pro-
cess. The alternative is a period similar to the 1930s: finan-
cial turmoil, beggar-thy-neighbor policies leading to worldwide
depression and perhaps even war.

EPILOGUE
I
The unifying theme of this book is the concept of reflexivity. I
have focused on its implications for the social sciences in general
and financial markets in particular. I have left other areas largely
unexplored. I should like to mention them briefly here, although
my thoughts relating to them are not properly developed. They
ought to form the subject of another book in the future, but I am
afraid I may not have a chance to write it, especially if I remain
involved in financial markets.
First, the question of values. Economic theory has trained us to
take values as given, although the evidence sugge~~thtahet y are
shaped by a reflexive process. Most values can be reduced to
economic terms nowadays-the most recent Nobel laureate in
economics earned his prize by interpreting politics as an eco-
nomic process in which the participants seek to maximize their
own benefits-but that has not always been the case, and even
today there are many parts of the world where profit-maximizing
behavior takes second place to other motivations. Religion and
tradition are less easily amenable to economic analysis than is
politics in a materialistic culture. We have great difficulty in un-
derstanding a phenomenon like Islamic fundamentalism; at the
other end of the scale, a movement that we profess to admire,
Solidarity, is also alien to our way of thinking.
The predominance of economic values in Western and western-
ized societies is itself a function of our economic success. Values
evolve in reflexive fashion: the fact that economic activity has
borne positive results has enhanced the value we put on eco-

nomic values. The same can be said about scientific method: the
I
triumphs of natural science have raised the status of scientific
method to unsustainable heights. Conversely, various forms of art
have played a much bigger role in cultures not very far removed
from our own just because it was easier to achieve positive results
in art than in economic activity. Even today, poetry carries a
weight in Eastern Europe, including the Soviet Union, that we
find difficult to appreciate in the West. There is little doubt in my
mind that our emphasis on material values, profit, and efficiency
has been carried to an extreme.
Reflexive processes are bound to lead to excesses, but it is im-
possible to define what is excessive because in matters of values
there is no such thing as normal. Perhaps the best way to ap-
t proach the subject of values is to start from the position that they
are rooted in fantasy rather than reality. As a consequence, every
set of values has a flaw in it. We can then ask what are the ele-
ments of fantasy in a particular set of values and how the ele-
ments of fantasy and reality have interacted. Any other approach
would introduce a bias in favor of our own flawed set of values.
Values are closely associated with the concept of self-a reflex-
ive concept if ever there was one. What we think has a much
greater bearing on what we are than on the world around us. What
we are cannot possibly correspond to what we think we are, but
there is a two-way interplay between the two concepts. As we
make our way in the world our sense of self evolves. The relation-
ship between what we think we are and what we are in reality is
the key to happiness-in other words, it provides the subjective
meaning of life.
I could readily provide a reflexive interpretation of my own
development but I am reluctant to do so because it would be too
revealing, not to say incriminating. It will come as no surprise to
the reader when I admit that I have always harbored an exagger-
ated view of my self-importance-to put it bluntly, I fancied my-
self as some kind of god or an economic reformer like Keynzs
(each with his General Theory) or, even better, a scientist like
Einstein (reflexivity sounds like relativity). My sense of reality
was strong enough to make me realize that these expectations
were excessive and I kept them hidden as a guilty secret. This
was a source of considerable unhappiness through much of my
adult life. As I made my way in the world, reality came close
enough to my fantasy to allow me to admit my secret, at least to

myself. Needless to Fay, I feel much happier as a result. I have
been fortunate enough to be able to act out some of my fantasies
-this book, in particular, fills me with a great sense of accom-
plishment. Reality falls far short of my expectations, as the reader
can readily observe, but I no longer need to harbor a sense of guilt.
Writing this book, and especially these lines, exposes me in a way
I never dared to expqse myself before, but 1 feel I can afford it: my
success in business protects me. I am free to explore my abilities
to their limits, exactly because I do not know where those limits
are. Criticism will help me in this endeavor. The only thing that
could hurt me is if my success encouraged me to return to my
childhood fantasies of omnipotence-but that is not likely to hap-
pen as long as I remain engaged in the financial markets, because
they constantly remind me of my limitations. Given my person-
ality I have been extremely lucky in my career choice, but of
course it was not really a choice but a reflexive process in the
course of which both my career and my sense of self evolved in
tandem. I could say a lot more on the subject, but as long as I have
a career in business I have to plead the Fifth Amendment. There
is a point beyond which self-revelation can be damaging and one
of the flaws in my character, which I have not fully fathomed, is
the urge to reveal myself. Perhaps I was exaggerating a minute ago
when I said I am not afraid of exposing myself.
I also have some views on what could be called the meaning of
life in the objective sense-if it were not a contradtiction in terms
to use the word "objective" in this context. I start from the posi-
tion that every human endeavor is flawed: if we were to discard
(everything that is flawed there would be nothing left. We must
therefore make the most of what we have; the alternative is to
embrace death. The choice is a real one, because death can be
embraced in a number of ways; the pursuit of perfection and
eternity in all its manifestations is equivalent to choosing the idea
of death over the idea of life. If we carry this line of argument to
its logical conclusion, the meaning of life consists of the flaws in
one's conceptions and what one does about them. Life can be seen
as a fertile fallacy.
So far I have spoken mainly in terms of the individual. But the
individual does not exist in isolation; his inherently imperfect
understanding makes him all the more dependent on the society
to which he belongs. The analysis that has led to the concept of
reflexivity also throws some light on the relationship between the

,
individual and society. It is a mistake to think that there are two
separate entities involved: the relationship is between a part and
a whole. We have seen the cognitive difficulties that such a rela-
tionship gives rise to: neither the individual nor society can be
defined without reference to the other. Given the structure of our
language it is extremely difficult to recognize the contingent na-
ture of the two entities, and as a matter of historical fact most
discourses on the subject have taken either the whole or the part
as their starting point. The choice of the starting point tends to
infuse the rest of the discussion with a bias. The famous speech
of Agrippa in which he compares society with an organism epit-
omizes one extreme, and Rousseau's social contract the other.
In order to avoid the bias inherent in these extremes new cate-
t gories of speech need to be established. An appropriate language
is beginning to emerge in the context of computer science and
systems analysis, but it will take time to permeate general dis-
course.* Even if we learn to think in terms of reflexive and recur-
sive relations, we are confronted with a substantive choice:
should society take a predetermined shape or should its members
be allowed to determine the form of society in which they live?
The former kind of society has been described by Karl Popper as
closed, the latter as open.
I have just come back from China where the issue is of vital
significance. The country has passed through a horrendous period
during which the collective terrorized the individual on a mas-
sive scale. It is now run by a group of people who had been on
the receiving end of the terror. These people have ample reason
to be passionately devoted to the cause of individual freedom; but
they are up against a long tradition of feudalism, an all-pervasive
bureaucracy, and the constraints of Marxist ideology.
I was surprised to find an avid interest in the concept of reflex-
ivity. As I have noted in the book, reflexivity could also be de-
scribed as a kind of dialectics, but I have eschewed using the word
because of the heavy intellectual baggage it carries. It is exa$ly
these connotations that make the concept so fascinating for the
Chinese because it allows them to modify Marxist ideology with-
out breaking with it. Hegel propounded a dialectic of ideas; Marx
* I have been much taken by Gregory Bateson, Steps to an Ecology of Mind (New
York: Ballantine, 1975), and Douglas R. Hofstadter, Godel, Escher, Bach: An
Eternal Golden Braid (New York: Basic Books, 1979).

turned the idea on it$ head and espoused dialectic materialism;
now there is a new dialectic that connects the participants' think-
ing with the events in which they participate-that is, it operates
between ideas and material conditions. If Hegel's concept was the
thesis and Marxism the antithesis, reflexivity is the synthesis.
But there is a fundamental difference between Marxism and the
new dialectic. Marx lpbored under the misapprehension that, in
order to be scientific, a theory has to determine the future course
of history. The new dialectic is emphatically not deterministic.
Since the shape of society cannot be "scientifically" determined,
it must be left to the participants to decide their own form of
organization. Since nt, participant has a monopoiy on truth, the
best arrangement allows for a critical process in which conflicting
views can be freely debated and eventually tested against reality.
Democratic elections provide such a forum in politics, and the
market mechanism provides one in economics. Neither markets
nor elections constitute an objective criterion, only an expression
of the prevailing bias; but that is the best available in an imperfect
world. Thus, the concept of reflexivity leads directly to the con-
cept of an open society-hence its "charm" in contemporary
China. As far as I am concerned, it completes what Hofstadter
would call a "recursive loop" between my concept of reflexivity,
my interest in financial markets, and my devotion to the ideal of
an open society.

APPENDIX
PROSPECT FOR
EUROPEAN DISINTEGRATION
I am very grateful to the Aspen Institute for giving me this oppor-
tunity to address an audience in Germany, and I have chosen a
topic which ought to be of particular interest to people in Germany.
My topic is the prospect of European disintegration.
It is a subject that engages me in three different ways. First, I am
passionately devoted to the idea of Europe as an open society. Sec-
ond, I have developed a theory of history which casts light on the
process of European integration and disintegration. Third, I am a
participant in the process.
Open society means a society based on the idea that nobody has a
monopoly on truth; a society which is not dominated by the state or
by any particular ideology, where minorities and minority opinions
are respected. Using these criteria, the ~uro~eCanom munity is a
highly desirable form of organization. Indeed, in some ways it is
ideal, because it has a very interesting feature: all the participating
states are in a minority. Respect for the minority is the basis of its
construction. The unresolved question is: how much power should
be delegated to the majority? How far should Europe be integrated?
The way Europe evolves will have a profound influence on what
happens to the east of Europe, the region that was formerly under
the sway of Communist ideology. Communism built a universal
closed society, but Communism as an ideology is now well and
truly dead. The line of least resistance leads to the break-up of the
universal closed system into particular closed societies, based on

Appendix 369
the principle of national or ethnic identity. We can see the principle
well advanced in the former Yugoslavia. The only possible escape
from this fate is to make the transition from closed to open society.
But that is not so easy. It requires time and effort to establish the
rule of law, the institutians of civil society, and the critical way of
thinking which are characteristic of an open society. Societies dev-
astated by Communism Gannot make the transition on their own.
They need a Europe that is open and receptive and supportive of
their effort. East Germany got too much help, the rest of Eastern
Europe too little. I am deeply engaged in helping the rest of Eastern
Europe. As you may knoiv, I have set up a network of foundations
devoted to this cause, and that is the bias that I bring to the subject
of Europe.
My second involvement is that I have developed a theory of his-
tory which has guided me both in my activities in the financial mar-
kets and in setting up the foundation network. The key to my theory
is the role that mistakes and misconceptions play in shaping the
course of events. Thereis,a lways a divergence between the partici-
pants' thinking and the actual state of affairs, but sometimes the
divergence is relatively small and self-correcting-I call this "near-
equilibrium"; and, at other times, the divergence is large, with no
tendency to correct itself-I call this "far-from-equilibrium." The
course of events has quite a different character in near-equilibrium
and in far-from-equilibrium conditions. This point is not generally
und&stood. My theory relates to far-from-equilibriuG conditions.
I have made a particular study of what I call the "boom/bust se-
quence," which can be observed from time to time in financial mar-
kets; and I think it is also applicable to the integration and
disintegration of the European Community. Since the revolution of
1989 and the reunification of Germany, Europe has been in a condi-
tion of dynamic disequilibrium. Therefore it presents a very inter-
esting case study for my theory of history.
And, finally, I am myself a participant in this process of dynamic
disequilibrium because I am an international investor. I used to call
myself a speculator and I used to joke that an investment is a spec-
ulation that has gone wrong but, in view of the campaign against
speculators, I am no longer amused. International investors did
play an important role in the breakdown of the Exchange Rate
Mechanism, but it is impossible to have a common market without
international capital movements. To blame speculators is like
shooting the messenger.

I shall deal with my subject on the basis of my theory of history.
I
The fact that I am also a participant does not interfere with my abil-
ity to apply the theory. On the contrary, it has allowed me to test it
in practice. Nor does it matter that I bring a particular bias to the
subject because it is part of my theory that participants in a histor-
ical process always act on the basis of a bias. And, of course, the
same rule applies to the proponents of theories.
But I must confess that my particular bias-namely, that I want
to see a united, prosperous and open Europe--does interfere with
my activities as a participant in financial markets. I had no problem
as long as I was an anonymous participant. Sterling would have left
the ERM whether or not I speculated against it. But, after sterling
left the ERM, I received a lot of publicity and I ceased to be an
4 anonymous participant. I became a guru. I could actually influence
the behavior of markets, and it would be dishonest of me to pretend
otherwise. This has created opportunities and imposed responsi-
bilities. Given my bias, I did not want to be responsible for the
French franc being pushed out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. I
decided to abstain from speculating against the franc in order to be
able to put forward a constructive solution; but nobody thanked me
for it. Indeed, my public utterances seemed to annoy the monetary
authorities even more than my activities in the financial markets,
so I can't say I am doing well in my newfound role of guru. Never-
theless, given my bias, I must say what I am going to say, even if it
is inconvenient for me as a participant.
The important point about my boom/bust theory is that there is
nothing inevitable about it. The typical boom/bust sequence is ini-
tially self-reinforcing and, eventually, self-defeating, but it can be
aborted or diverted at any point. It is in the light of this theory that
I shall comment on the boom/bust process of European integra-
tion. I shall pay particular attention to the Exchange Rate Mecha-
nism, which is playing such a crucial role in the process. It had
worked perfectly well in near-equilibrium conditions, until the re-
unification of Germany. But the reunification has created condi-
tions of dynamic disequilibrium. Since that time, the course of
events has been shaped by mistakes and misunderstandings. The
most tangible result is the disintegration of the Exchange Rate
Mechanism which, in turn, is an important factor in the possible
disintegration of the European Community.
Let me start at the point where near-equilibrium conditions were
replaced by a condition of dynamic disequilibrium. This point can

be fixed in time with great precision: it was the fall of the Berlin
Wall. This opened the hay to German reunification. Chancellor
Kohl rose to the historic occasion. He decided that reunification
must be complete, immediate and achieved in a European context.
Actually, he had no choice in the matter, since the German consti-
tution gave East ~ermansci tizenship of Germany and Germany
was a member of the European Community. But it makes all the
difference whether youi take charge of events or merely react to
them. Chancellor Kohl exhibited real leadership. He went to Presi-
dent Mitterand and said to him, in effect, "I need your support and
the support of Europe to achieve immediate and complete reunifi-
cation." The French replied, in effect, "Let's create a stronger Eu-
rope in which the reunified Germany can be fully embedded." This
gave a tremendous impulse towards integration. It set into motion
the "boom" part of the boom/bust process. The British were op-
posed to the creation of a strong central authority; you will recall
Margaret Thatcher's speech at Bruges. Tough negotiations ensued,
but there was a sense of urgency, a self-imposed deadline. The re-
sult was the Treaty of ~aastrichtt,h e two main goals of which were
to establish a common currency and a common foreign policy. It
had a number of other provisions, but they were less important
and, when the British objected, .they were allowed to opt out of
some of them. All in all, the Treaty was a giant step forward to-
wards integfation, a valiant attempt to create a Europe strong
enough to cope with the revolutionary changes resu-ECting from the
collapse of the Soviet empire. It went, perhaps, further and faster
than public opinion was prepared for; but that was a chance that
theleaders took in order to cope with the revolutionary situation.
r'iightly so, in my opinion, because that is what leadership entails.
The trouble lay elsewhere. I shall not dwell on a side deal in
which Germany got the agreement of the European Community to
recognize Croatia and Slovenia as independent states. It was little
discussed and little noticed at the time, but it had horrendous con-
sequences. I want to focus on the internal disequilibrium in Ger-
many which was generated by the reunification because it was that
disequilibrium which has turned the boom into a bust.
The German government seriously underestimated the cost of
reunification and was, in any case, unwilling to pay the full cost
through higher taxation or a reduction of other government expen-
ditures. This created tensions between the Bundesbank and the
government on two levels: one was that the government acted

against the express advice of the Bundesbank; the other was that a
t
very loose fiscal policy-that is to say, a huge budget deficit-
required a very tight monetary policy in order to reestablish mone-
tary equilibrium. The injection of purchasing power through the
exchange of East German currency at par created an inflationary
boom, and the fiscal deficit added fuel to the fire. The Bundesbank
was charged, by law, with the mission of maintaining the value of
the Deutschmark and it acted with alacrity. It raised the rep0 rate
to 9.70 percent. But that policy was very harmful to the other mem-
ber countries of the European Monetary System. In other words,
the monetary policy which was designed to reestablish equilibrium
at home created a disequilibrium within the European Monetary
System. It took some time for the disequilibrium to develop but,
I with the passage of time, the tight monetary policy imposed by the
Bundesbank pushed all of Europe into the deepest recession it has
experienced since the Second World War. The Bundesbank plays a
dual role: it is the guardian of sound money at home and it is the
anchor of the EMS. It acted as the transmission mechanism for
turning the internal disequilibrium of the German economy into a
force for the disintegration of $he EMS.
There was also a third and deeper level of conflict between the
Bundesbank and the German government. Chancellor Kohl, in or-
der to obtain French support for German reunification, entered
into the Treaty of Maastricht. That Treaty posed a profound threat
to the institutional dominance, indeed, institutional survival, of
the Bundesbank as the arbiter of European monetary policy. In
the EMS, the German mark serves as the anchor. But, under the
Maastricht Treaty, the role of the Bundesbank was to be replaced by
a European central bank in which the Bundesbank v~~uolndly have
one vote out of twelve. Admittedly, the European Central Bank was
based on the German model; but it makes all the difference in the
world whether you serve as the model or whether you are actually
in charge. The Bundesbank never openly acknowledged that it was
opposed to this institutional change, and it remains unclear to
what extent its actions were designed to prevent it. All4 can tell
you is that, as a market participant, I acted on the hypothesis that it
was the Bundesbank's underlying motivation. I cannot prove to you
that my hypothesis was correct; all I can say is that it worked.
For instance, I listened to Helmut Schlesinger warn that the mar-
kets are mistaken when they think that the ECU consists of a fixed
basket of currencies. I asked him what he thought of the ECU as the

future common currency of Europe. He said he would like it better
if it were called the mark. 1 was guided accordingly. Shortly there-
after, the lira was forced out of the ERM.
1 don't want to get ,into a blow-by-blow account of what hap-
pened because I want ,to establish a broad historical perspective.
From that perspective,1t he salient features are that the Maastricht
referendum was defeated in Denmark; it passed with a very nar-
row margin in France;'and it barely squeaked through Parliament
in Britain. The European Exchange Rate Mechanism has, for all
intents and purposes, broken down and it has done so in several
installments, of which#thel ast one, namely, the broadening of the
band in August, was the most far-reaching because it loosened the
strongest tie within the European Community, the one which ties
Germany and France together. What is in the long run even more
important, Europe is in the midst of a deep recession from which
there is no immediate prospect of recovery. Unemployment is a se-
rious and still-growing problem which continues to be aggravated
by monetary policies which are far too restrictive for this stage of
the cycle. From these observations, 1 conclude that the trend to-
wards the integration of Europe has passed its peak and has now
been reversed.
The exact moment of reversal can be identified as the defeat in the
Danish referendum. It 'could have brought forth a groundswell of
support >or the Maastricht Treaty; in that case, there would have
been no reversal. Instead, it generated the breakhn of the Ex-
change Rate Mechanism. Europe is now in a process of disintegra-
tion. Since we are dealing with a boom/bust process, it is impossible
to say how far it will go. But it may go much further than people are
currently willing or able to envisage because a boomibust process is
self-reinforcing in both directions.
1 can identify at least five elements which are mutually self-
reinforcing. First and foremost is the recession; 11.7 percent un-
employment in France, 14.1 percent in Belgium, and 22.25 percent
in Spain, are simply not acceptable. They generate social and
political unrest which is easily channeled in an anti-European di-
rection. Second, there is the progressive disintegration of the Ex-
change Rate Mechanism. This is very dangerous because in the
medium to long term the Common Market cannot survive with-
out stability in exchange rates.
The ERM functioned perfectly well in near-equilibrium condi-
tions for more than a decade. But the reunification of Germany has

revealed a fundamental flaw in the mechanism, namely, that the
I
Bundesbank plays a dual role: guardian of domestic monetary sta-
bility and anchor of the EMS. As long as the two roles are in har-
mony, there is no problem. But when there was a conflict, the
Bundesbank gave precedence to domestic considerations to the
detriment of its international obligations. This was clearly demon-
strated, for instance, on Thursday, July 29th, when it refused to
lower the discount rate in order to relieve the pressure on the
French franc. It can be argued that the Bundesbank has no choice
in the matter: it is obliged by law, the Grundgesetz, to give absolute
priority to the preservation of the value of the German currency.
In that case, there is an irreconcil251e cord lief between the ERM
and the Grundgesetz.
This episode revealed another fundamental flaw in the ERM,
I
namely, that there is an asymmetry between the obligations of the
anchor currency and the currency which is under pressure. All the
obligations fall on the weak currency. It will be recalled that, at the
time of the Bretton Woods agreement, John Maynard Keynes em-
phasized the need for symmetry between the strong and the weak.
He based his arguments on the experiences of the inter-war period.
The current situation is increasingly reminiscent of that period and
sometimes it seems as if Keynes had not lived.
This brings me to the third element, namely, mistaken economic
and monetary policies. Here it is not so much the Bundesbank that
is to blame but those who have opposed it, like the German govern-
ment, or those who have been the victims of its policy, like the
United Kingdom and France. The German government is, of
course, responsible for creating the internal disequilibrium in the
first place. The British committed an egregious error in jviiiifig the
Exchange Rate Mechanism on October Bth, 1990 after the reunifica-
tion of Germany. They did so on the basis of arguments which had
been developed in 1985, but were strenuously resisted by Margaret
Thatcher. When her position weakened, she finally gave in, but by
that time, the arguments which had been valid in 1985 were no
longer applicable. So the British made two mistakes--o~_lei n 1985
and one in 1990.
They were particularly hard hit by the high interest rate regime
imposed on them by the Bundesbank because they were already in
a recession when they went into the ERM. Being pushed out of the
ERM brought them much-needed relief. They ought to have wel-
comed it, but they were too dazed to react. They did the right thing

eventually and lowered interest rates, but they failed to seize the
initiative. This has made it harder to build up confidence and it will
make it much harder to reassert control over wages when the econ-
omy does pick up.
One would have thought the French would learn from the British
experience. But they are proving even more inflexible. One could
sympathize with their efforts to defend the franc fort policy because
they fought so long and so hard to establish it, and they were on the
verge of reaping the benefits in the form of improved competitive-
ness vis-a-vis Germany when the reward was snatched from their
hands by recurrent attacks on the franc. But, once the franc fort pol-
icy proved untenable, they ought Po have adjusted their approach to
the new situation. Instead, they are sticking voluntarily with a
regime which proved so disastrous when it was imposed on them
by the ERM. I think I understand their motivation: they are con-
cerned with rebuilding their reserves and repaying the debt that
the Banque de France incurred with the Bundesbank in defending
the parity. But they got their priorities wrong. France is in a serious
recession and it needs to lower interest rates. That is what brought
on the August crisis. To try and keep the French franc close to the
Deutschmark by keeping interest rates high is self-defeating. The
only way to have a strong franc is to have a strong economy.
The Bundesbank itself has been remarkably consistent in the
pursuit of its objectives, especially if we include institutional self-
preservation among those objectives, and amazing% successful. It
found itself in an impossible situation after the reunification of
Germany: a sudden increase in the stock of money, an enormous
budget deficit, and a threat to its institutional survival. Yet it came
out victorious. Whether it was worth the cost-a Europe-wide re-
cession and the breakdown of the ERM-is another question.
A few months ago I was convinced that the Bundesbank was fol-
lowing the wrong monetary policy, even for domestic purposes, be-
cause Germany was in a recession and monetary policy ought to be
counter-cyclical. The Bundesbank stuck to its medium-term mone-
tary targets, but I thought that M3-which had worked well as a
target in near-equilibrium conditions-had been rendered irrele-
vant in today's far-from-equilibrium conditions; and I thought that
the Bundesbank had overstayed its course in following a tight mon-
etary policy.
But that was before the widening of the bands in the ERM. Since
then, the Deutschmark has rallied, the German long bonds have

strengthened and, on top of it all, the German economy is showing
I
some signs of strength. I must now admit that I may have been
wrong and the Bundesbank may have been successful in its pursuit
of its domestic policy goals. But, if anything, that strengthens my
argument that there is a conflict of interest between the domestic
responsibilities of the Bundesbank and its role as the anchor of the
EMS. The events of the last two months have clearly demonstrated
that the needs of Germany and the rest of Europe are very differ-
ent. Germany needs low interest rates on long bonds because it bor-
rows at the long end, whereas the rest of Europe needs lower
interest rates at the short end because the liquidity of the banking
system needs to be rebuilt and hwer short-term rates zre needed to
stimulate economic activity. Germany got what it needs, but the
rest of Europe did not.
t
The fact that I may have been wrong on the Deutschmark brings
me to the fourth factor. It is not only the authorities who make mis-
takes, but also market participants. Markets are often wrong.
Specifically, they were wrong when 'they assumed that the path to a
common currency would follow a straight line. International in-
vestors, particularly managers of international bond funds, went for
the highest yields, ignoring exchange rate risks. Helmut Schlesinger
was right in warning that the ECU does not consist of a fixed basket
of currencies. There had been large capital movements into weak-
currency countries like Italy, Spain and Portugal. The movement
was initially self-reinforcing but eventually self-defeating. It cre-
ated excessive rigidity in exchange rates in the first place, and exces-
sive instability in the second. The errors of the market compounded
the errors of the authorities in creating dynamic disequilibrium.
Finally, there is a fifth factor that reinforces the trend toward
disintegration. It may be called the emotional amplifier. When
things are going wrong, especially when mistakes are being made,
there is an impulse to blame someone else. Who would have
thought that respected officials like Jacques Delors and the Finance
Minister of Belgium and the newly appointed head of the Banque
de France really believed in an Anglo-Saxon conspiracy/ to destroy
the Franco-German alliance? These attitudes then color subsequent
discussions as in the case of the GATT negotiations.
There is also a sixth element which needs to be considered;
namely, the instability of Eastern Europe and particularly of the
former Yugoslavia. I believe that this factor is working in the oppo-
site direction. The threat of instability and the influx of refugees

are good reasons to band together and build a "Fortress Europe."
At the same time, tkie lack of unity in the European Community
has the effect of reinforcing the political instability and economic
decline in Eastern Europe. The outcome is going to be a European
Community which is a far cry from the open society to which the
people whom I suppdrt in Eastern Europe aspire.
All this is truly disturbing and depressing. I realize that I sound
more like a prophet of gloom and doom than a guru. But let me re-
mind you that there is nothing determinate about the boom/bust
sequence; that the direction of the process can be reversed practi-
cally at any time. Indeed, a reversal of direction is an essential part
of a boom/bust sequence. What I am trying to say is that exrents are
now going in the wrong direction and they will continue to go in
that direction until we recognize that there is something funda-
mentally wrong and we take resolute action to correct it.
There can be no doubt that there is something fundamentally
wrong with the European Monetary System as it is currently con-
stituted. First, the domestic obligations of the Bundesbank have
proven to be irreconci'lable with its role as the anchor currency; in-
deed, one could argue that the Bundesbank has exploited its role as
the anchor currency in order to solve its domestic problems. Sec-
ond, there is an asymmetry between the obligations of the strong
and the weak currencies. And most importantly, there is asymme-
try between the risks and rewards of international investors, that is
to say, speculators. These structural faults were these from the be-
ginning, but they only became apparent in the course of the last
year. Once they became known, it is impossible to return to the
conditions which prevailed previously. The best way to eliminate
the faults of the ERM Is to have no exchange rate mechanism at
all. But freely floating exchange rates would destroy the Common
Market. Hence the necessity for a common currency. That means
implementing the Maastricht Treaty. At the time the treaty was ne-
gotiated, the path leading to the common currency was envisaged
as a gradual, near-equilibrium path. But the gradual path has run
into unexpected obstacles. To continue on a gradual path will now
lead in the opposite direction because there has been a trend rever-
sal and we are now in a process of disintegration. Therefore we
must find a different path. If we can't get there gradually, it is bet-
ter to get there all at once than not to get there at all.
At the emergency meeting on August lst, an official from
Portugal reportedly proposed that the introduction of a common

currency should be speeded up. A German participant reportedly
1
reacted by saying, "Surely, you must be joking!" If my line of ar-
gument is correct, it is time to take the suggestion seriously. This
may sound a little too facile, and it is. My argument will be taken
seriously only if I can show a path that would lead to a common
currency. Since we are in dynamic disequilibrium, the path has to
be a disequilibrium one. At present, the first priority of the
Fre2ch monetary authorities is to rebuild their reserves. In order
to do so, they are trying to keep the French franc strong. That is
wrong. The first priority ought to be to stimulate the French econ-
omy, and the maturity of the French debt to the Bundesbank
ought to be extended for, say, two years so that France could low~r
interest rates now. When I say lower interest rates, I mean three
I percent. The rate reduction ought to be coordinated with the
other members of the EMS, excluding Germany and Holland. The
Deutschmark would undoubtedly appreciate. The over valuation
of the Deutschmark would have a negative effect on the German
economy, hastening the decline in German interest rates. As the
German economy weakened and the rest of Europe picked up, the
trend in exchange rates would be reversed and they may eventu-
ally settle down not very far from where they were before the
bands were widened. The main difference would be in economic
activity. The rest of Europe would recover, first at the expense of
Germany; but eventually Germany would also join the recovery.
When that happened, the dynamic disequilibrium would have
been corrected, and the march towards a common currency could
be resumed in near-equilibrium conditions. The whole process
would not take more than two years. After that, you could move
to a common currency directly, without reinstituting the narrow
bands. But you cannot get there in a straight line. Right now, you
are caught in a vicious circle; you need to turn it around and
make it a virtuous circle. This has already happened, up to a
point, in Italy. It could be done in the rest of Europe.
I have not dealt with issues of foreign policy, the future of NATO
and the fate of Eastern Europe, but I have covered too much ground
already. In any case, those issues are intricately interlinked with
monetary policy. European monetary policy is wrong and it can be
corrected.
